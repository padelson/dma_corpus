intention that the Arrangement be treated as a reorganization within the

(d)

 

 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Silverstone has the requisite
corporate power, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this

(e)

 

 _No Violations_. Neither the authorization, execution and delivery of this

available or cause any payment or other obligation to be imposed on
Silverstone or any of its subsidiaries, under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of: (A) their respective articles, charters or by-laws or other

Silverstone or any of its subsidiaries. The authorization of this Agreement,
the execution and delivery by Silverstone of this Agreement and the

consummation by Silverstone of the Arrangement, will not (x) give rise to any
rights of first refusal or trigger any change in control provisions or any
restrictions, obligations, consent requirements, rights or limitation under
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, license, franchise, Permit or
otherwise, or result in the imposition of any encumbrance, charge or Lien upon

5.3.2

 

Silver Wheaton covenants and agrees that, during the period from the date of

into other shares), the Board of Directors of Silver Wheaton shall ensure
that, pursuant to the Arrangement, Silverstone Shareholders are entitled to
receive, in lieu of the number of Silver Wheaton Shares to which they were
theretofore entitled under the Arrangement, the aggregate number of shares,
other securities or other property which such holder would have been entitled
to receive as a result of the transaction if, on the effective date or record
date thereof, as the case may be, it had been the registered holder of the
number of Silver Wheaton Shares to which such holder was entitled upon
completion of the Arrangement.

 

5.4

 

Mutual Covenants

 

Each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated in this
Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Effective Time and the time that this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms:

 

(a)

 

it shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy (or cause the satisfaction of) the conditions precedent to
its obligations hereunder as set forth in Article VI to the extent the same is
within its control and to take, or cause to be taken, all other action and to
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable under
all applicable Laws to complete the Plan of Arrangement, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) obtain all Key Regulatory Approvals
required to be obtained by it and, further to this requirement, in the event
that the Key Regulatory Approvals in respect of the Competition Act have not
been satisfied within 30 business days following the execution of this
Agreement, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing otherwise, each Party
shall file a notification to the Commissioner of Competition in accordance
with section 114 of the Competition Act by or before the 35th business day
following the execution of this Agreement; (ii) effect all necessary
registrations, filings and submissions of information requested by
Governmental Entities required to be effected by it in connection with the
Plan of Arrangement; (iii) oppose, lift or rescind any injunction or
restraining order against it or other order or action against it seeking to
stop, or otherwise adversely affecting its ability to make and complete, the
Plan of Arrangement; and (iv) co-operate with the other Party in connection
with the performance by it and its subsidiaries of their obligations
hereunder; in addition, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
none of the Parties shall knowingly take or cause to be taken any action which
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby;

 


  

 

\- 40 -

 



  

 



 

(b)

 

it shall not take any action, refrain from taking any commercially reasonable
action, or permit any action to be taken or not taken, which is inconsistent
with this Agreement or which would reasonably be expected to significantly
impede the making or completion of the Plan of Arrangement except as permitted
by this Agreement;

 

(c)

 

Silverstone shall effect such reorganization of its business, operations,
subsidiaries and assets or such other transactions (each, a "Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization") as Silver Wheaton may reasonably request prior to the
Effective Date, and the Plan of Arrangement, if required, shall be modified
accordingly; provided, however, that Silverstone need not effect a Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization which in the opinion of Silverstone, acting
reasonably: (i) would require Silverstone to obtain the prior approval of the
shareholders of Silverstone in respect of such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
other than at the Silverstone Meeting; or (ii) would impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Arrangement. Without limiting the foregoing and
other than as set forth in clause (i) above, Silverstone shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from any persons to effect each Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, and
Silverstone shall cooperate with Silver Wheaton in structuring, planning and
implementing any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. Silver Wheaton shall
provide written notice to Silverstone of any proposed Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization at least 10 business days prior to the date of the Silverstone
Meeting. In addition:

 

(A)

 

Silver Wheaton shall indemnify and save harmless Silverstone and its
subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of any Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization;

 

(B)

 

any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not become effective unless Silver
Wheaton shall have waived or confirmed in writing the satisfaction of all
conditions in its favour in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 and shall have
confirmed in writing that it is prepared to promptly without condition (other
than the satisfaction of the condition contemplated by Section 6.2(a)) proceed
to effect the Arrangement;

 


  

 

\- 41 -

 



  

 



 

(C)

 

any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not unreasonably interfere in
material operations prior to the Effective Time of Silverstone or any of its
subsidiaries;

 

(D)

 

unless the Parties otherwise agree, any Reorganization shall not require any
filings with, notifications to or approvals of any Governmental Entity or
third party (other than such Tax rulings, and filing such Tax elections or
notifications and prefilings or pre-clearances with corporations branches or
similar Governmental Entities, as are necessary or advisable in the
circumstances);

 

(E)

 

any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not require Silverstone or any
subsidiary to contravene any applicable Laws, their respective organizational
documents or any Material Contract; and

 

(F)

 

Silverstone and its subsidiaries shall not be obligated to take any action
that could result in any Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax or other
consequences to, any securityholder of Silverstone incrementally greater than
the Taxes or other consequences to such party in connection with the
consummation of the Arrangement in the absence of any Reorganization; and

 

(G)

 

Silver Wheaton acknowledges and agrees that the planning for and
implementation of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not be considered a
breach of any covenant under this Agreement and shall not be considered in
determining whether a representation or warranty of Silverstone hereunder has
been breached. Silver Wheaton and Silverstone shall work cooperatively and use
reasonable commercial efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all
documentation necessary and do such other acts and things as are necessary to
give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. For greater certainty,
Silverstone shall not be liable for the failure of Silver Wheaton to benefit
from any anticipated tax efficiency as a result of a Reorganization.

 

(d)

 

If the Arrangement is not completed, Silver Wheaton shall forthwith reimburse
Silverstone for all reasonable fees and expenses (including any professional
fees and expenses) incurred by Silverstone and its subsidiaries in considering
and effecting a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization and shall be responsible for
any costs of Silverstone and its subsidiaries in reversing or voiding any Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization that was effected at Silver Wheatons request,
provided that no reimbursement for fees and expenses shall be payable by
Silver Wheaton pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) in the event this Agreement is
terminated by Silver Wheaton pursuant to Sections 8.2.1(b)(iii), 8.2.1(c)(ii)
(as so far as the conditions relate to Silverstone), 8.2.1(c)(iii), 8.2.1(v)
or upon the occurrence of the Termination Fee Event identified in Section
7.4.5(a). The obligation of Silver Wheaton to reimburse Silverstone for fees
and expense and be responsible for costs as set out in this Section and the
indemnity described in this Section will be in addition to any other
obligation hereunder and will survive termination of this Agreement
indefinitely.

ARTICLE 7 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

7.1

 

Notice and Cure Provisions

 

Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure
to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time of any event or state of
facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to:

 

(a)

 

cause any of the representations or warranties of any Party contained herein
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the date hereof or at
the Effective Time (provided that this paragraph (a) shall not apply in the
case of any event or state of facts resulting from actions or omissions of
Silverstone which are permitted or required by this Agreement); or

 

(b)

 

result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any Party hereunder prior to the
Effective Time.

 

Silver Wheaton may not exercise their rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.2.1(c)(iii) and Silverstone may not exercise its right

asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment or the applicable condition or
termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered,
provided that a Party is proceeding diligently to cure such matter and such
matter is capable of being cured, no Party may terminate this Agreement until

7.2.2

 

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2, Silverstone shall, and shall
cause its subsidiaries and Representatives to immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with
any persons conducted heretofore by Silverstone, its subsidiaries or any
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection
therewith, Silverstone will discontinue access to any of its confidential
information (and not establish or allow access to any of its confidential
information, or any data room, virtual or otherwise) and shall as soon as
possible request, to the extent that it is entitled to do so (and exercise all
rights it has to require) the return or destruction of all confidential
information regarding Silverstone and its subsidiaries previously provided to
any such person or any other person and will request (and exercise all rights
it has to require) the destruction of all material including or incorporating
or otherwise reflecting any material confidential information regarding
Silverstone and its subsidiaries. Silverstone agrees that neither it nor any
of its subsidiaries, shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of
any existing confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or
any standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party (it
being acknowledged and agreed that the automatic termination of any standstill
provisions of any such agreement as the result of the entering into and
announcement of this Agreement by Silverstone, pursuant to the express terms
of any such agreement, shall not be a violation of this Section 7.2.2) and
Silverstone undertakes to enforce all standstill, non-disclosure, non-
disturbance, non-solicitation and similar covenants that it or any of its
subsidiaries have entered into prior to the date hereof, provided that
Silverstone shall not be prevented from considering any Superior Proposal if
the provisions of this Section 7.2 are otherwise complied with.

 

7.2.3

 

Notwithstanding Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 and any other provision of this
Agreement or of any other agreement between the Parties or between Silverstone
and any other person, including the provisions of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and
prior to obtaining the approval of the Arrangement Resolution at the
Silverstone Meeting, Silverstone receives a written Acquisition Proposal that
the Silverstone Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, constitutes or, if consummated in
accordance with its terms, could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, then Silverstone may, provided it is in compliance with Section
7.2.4:

 

(a)

 

furnish information with respect to Silverstone and its subsidiaries to the
person making such Acquisition Proposal; and/or

 

(b)

 

enter into, participate, facilitate and maintain discussions or negotiations
with, and otherwise cooperate with or assist, the person making such
Acquisition Proposal,

 

provided that Silverstone shall not, and shall not allow its Representatives
to, disclose any non-public information with respect to Silverstone to such
person (i) if such non public information has not been previously provided to,
or is not concurrently provided to, Silver Wheaton; and (ii) without entering
into an agreement with such person substantially in the form of the
Confidentiality Agreement containing terms that are no more favourable to such
person than those found in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

7.2.4

 

Silverstone shall promptly notify Silver Wheaton, at first orally and then in
writing within 24 hours of receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, in the event
it receives an Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and
conditions thereof, and the identity of the person or persons making the
Acquisition Proposal, and shall include copies of any such proposal, inquiry,
offer or request, or any amendment to any of the foregoing. Silverstone shall
thereafter also provide such other details of such proposal, inquiry, offer or
request, or any amendment to any of the foregoing, as Silver Wheaton may
reasonably request. Silverstone shall keep Silver Wheaton fully informed as to
the status, including any changes to the material terms, of such proposal,
inquiry, offer or request, or any amendment to any of the foregoing, and shall
respond promptly to all inquiries from Silver Wheaton with respect thereto.

7.2.5

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
Section 7.3, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Silverstone Shareholder Approval at the Silverstone Meeting,
Silverstone receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Silverstone Board
concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Silverstone Board
may, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 7.4 and
Section 8.2, terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal.

 

7.3

 

Right to Match

 

7.3.1

 

Silverstone covenants that it will not accept, approve, endorse, recommend or
enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a
Superior Proposal (other than a confidentiality and standstill agreement
permitted by Section 7.2.3) unless:

 

(a)

 

Silverstone has complied with its obligations under Section 7.2 and has
provided Silver Wheaton with a copy of the Superior Proposal; and

 

(b)

 

a period (the "Response Period") of four Business Days has elapsed from the
date that is the later of (x) the date on which Silver Wheaton receives
written notice from the Silverstone Board that the Silverstone Board has
determined, subject only to compliance with this Section 7.3, to accept,
approve, endorse, recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, and (y) the date Silver Wheaton receives a copy of
the Superior Proposal.

 

7.3.2

 

During the Response Period, Silver Wheaton will have the right, but not the
obligation, to offer to amend this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement,
including an increase in, or modification of, the aggregate consideration.
The Silverstone Board shall review any such offer by Silver Wheaton to amend
this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement to determine whether the
Acquisition Proposal to which Silver Wheaton is responding would continue to
be a Superior Proposal when assessed against the Arrangement as it is proposed
in writing by Silver Wheaton to be amended. If the Silverstone Board
determines that the Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Silverstone Board, will cause Silverstone to enter into an
amendment to this Agreement with Silver Wheaton incorporating the amendments
to the Agreement and Plan of Arrangement as set out in the written offer to
amend, and will promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement and by
the prompt issuance of a press release to that effect. If the Silverstone
Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal, Silverstone may approve and recommend that holders of Silverstone
Shares accept such Superior Proposal and may terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.2.1(d)(i) in order to accept or enter into an agreement,
understanding or arrangement to proceed with the Superior Proposal.

 

7.3.3

 

Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in an
increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by the holders of the Silverstone Shares shall
constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 7.3 and
Silver Wheaton shall be afforded a new Response Period and the rights afforded
in paragraph 7.3.2 in respect of each such Acquisition Proposal.

 

7.4

 

Expenses and Termination Fees

 

7.4.1

 

All fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Plan of Arrangement shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees, costs
or expenses.

 

7.4.2

 

If a Termination Fee Event occurs, Silverstone shall pay Silver Wheaton (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds) the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.4.6.

Entity in connection with obtaining a Key Regulatory Approval.

7.4.5

 

For the purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee Event" means the
termination of this Agreement:

 

(a)

 

by Silver Wheaton pursuant to Section 8.2.1(c)(i) (except where the Change in

(b)

 

by Silverstone pursuant to Section 8.2.1(d)(i); or

than Silver Wheaton or any of its affiliates) and within nine months following
the date of such termination:

 

(i)

 

the Acquisition Proposal is consummated; or

 

(ii)

 

Silverstone and/or one or more of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement in respect of, or the Silverstone Board approves or recommends, such
Acquisition Proposal which is subsequently consummated at any time thereafter.

 

7.4.6

 

If a Termination Fee Event occurs due to a termination of this Agreement by
Silverstone pursuant to Section 8.2.1(d)(i), or by Silver Wheaton pursuant to
Section 8.2.1(c)(vi) or Section 8.2.1(c)(vi), the Termination Fee shall be
payable simultaneously with the occurrence of such Termination Fee Event. If a
Termination Fee Event occurs due to a termination of this Agreement by Silver
Wheaton pursuant to Section 8.2.1(c)(iv), the Termination Fee shall be payable
within two Business Days following such Termination Fee Event. If a
Termination Fee Event occurs in the circumstances set out in Section 7.4.5(c),
the Termination Fee shall be payable within two Business Days following the
closing of the applicable transaction referred to therein.

 

7.4.7

 

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
and that, without those agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in
this Section 7.4 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages, which the Party entitled to such damages will suffer
or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the
resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Silverstone
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defense that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, each
Party agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances
where Silver Wheaton is entitled to the Termination Fee and such Termination
Fee is paid in full, Silver Wheaton shall be precluded from any other remedy
against Silverstone at law or in equity or otherwise (including, without
limitation, an order for specific performance), and shall not seek to obtain
any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages, against Silverstone or any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, shareholders or affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

7.4.8

 

Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall relieve or have the effect of relieving any
Party in any way from liability for damages incurred or suffered by a Party as
a result of an intentional or wilful breach of this Agreement.

 

7.4.9

 

Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall preclude a Party from seeking injunctive
relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or
otherwise to obtain specific performance of any such covenants or agreements,
without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.

 

7.4.10

 

In no event shall Silverstone be obligated to pay to Silver Wheaton an amount
in respect of the termination of this Agreement that is, in aggregate, in
excess of the Termination Fee.

 

7.5

 

Access to Information; Confidentiality

 

From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable Law and
the terms of any existing Contracts, Silverstone shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, independent
auditors, accounting advisers and agents to, afford to Silver Wheaton and to
the officers, employees, agents and representatives of Silver Wheaton such
access as Silver Wheaton may reasonably require at all reasonable times,
including for the purpose of facilitating integration business planning, to
their officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records and Contracts,
and shall furnish Silver Wheaton with all data and information as Silver
Wheaton may reasonably request. Silver Wheaton and Silverstone acknowledge
and agree that information furnished pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

7.6

 

Insurance and Indemnification

 

7.6.1

 

Silver Wheaton will, or will cause Silverstone and its subsidiaries to,
maintain in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for six years
from the Effective Date customary policies of directors and officers
liability insurance providing protection no less favourable to the protection
provided by the policies maintained by Silverstone and its subsidiaries which
are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date and providing protection
in respect of claims arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior
to the Effective Date; provided, however, that Silver Wheaton acknowledges and
agrees that prior to the Effective Date, Silverstone may, in the alternative,
purchase run off directors and officers liability insurance for a period of
up to six years from the Effective Date on terms acceptable to Silver Wheaton,
acting reasonably.

 

7.6.2

 

Silver Wheaton agrees that it shall directly honour all rights to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of present and former
officers and directors of Silverstone and its subsidiaries to the extent that
they are disclosed in Schedule 7.6.2 of the Disclosure Letter, and
acknowledges that such rights, to the extent that they are disclosed in
Schedule 7.6.2 of the Disclosure Letter, shall survive the completion of the
Plan of Arrangement and shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of not less than six years from the Effective Date.

 

7.6.3

 

The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified person, his or her heirs and
his or her legal representatives and, for such purpose, Silverstone hereby
confirms that it is acting as agent and trustee on their behalf. Furthermore,
this Section 7.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement as a result
of the occurrence of the Effective Date for a period of six years.

to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the Province of Ontario
and the laws of Canada applicable therein. Each of the Parties hereby

PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

 

9.4

 

Injunctive Relief

 

Subject to Section 7.4, the Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur
for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for

Entire Agreement, Binding Effect and Assignment

 

Silver Wheaton may assign all or any part of its rights under this Agreement
to, and its obligations under this Agreement may be assumed by, a direct or
indirect subsidiary of Silver Wheaton, provided that if such assignment and/or
assumption takes place, Silver Wheaton shall continue to be liable jointly and
severally with such subsidiary for all of its obligations hereunder. This
Agreement shall be binding on and shall enure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto and the Disclosure
Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and, except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement is
not intended to and shall not confer upon any person other than the Parties
any rights or remedies hereunder. Except as expressly permitted by the terms
hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by either of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Party.

9.7

 

Severability

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the

to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
fullest extent possible.

 

9.8

 

Counterparts, Execution

one and the same instrument. The Parties shall be entitled to rely upon
delivery of an executed facsimile or similar executed electronic copy of this
Agreement, and such facsimile or similar executed electronic copy shall be
legally effective to create a valid and binding agreement between the Parties.

 ARRANGEMENT

 

Section 3.01

 

 _Arrangement_

 

At the Effective Time, the following shall occur and shall be deemed to occur
sequentially in the following order without any further act or formality:

 

(a)

 

each Silverstone Special Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one Silverstone Share at no additional
cost;

 

(b)

 

each Silverstone Share held by a Dissenting Shareholder shall be deemed to be
transferred by the holder thereof, free and clear of all liens, claims and
encumbrances, to Silverstone for cancellation and Silverstone shall thereupon
be obliged to pay the amount therefor determined and payable in accordance
with Article 4 hereof, and Silverstone shall cause such Silverstone Share to
be cancelled and the name of such holder shall be removed from the central
securities register as a holder of Silverstone Shares;

 

(c)

 

each Silverstone Share held by a Former Silverstone Shareholder (other than a
Dissenting Shareholder or Silver Wheaton or any subsidiary of Silver Wheaton)
shall be deemed to be transferred by the holder thereof, without any further
act or formality on its part, to Silver Wheaton and in consideration therefor
Silver Wheaton shall issue Silver Wheaton Shares on the basis of 0.185 of a
fully paid and non-assessable Silver Wheaton Share (the "Share Exchange
Ratio") for each Silverstone Share, subject to and hereof, and the name of
such holder shall be removed from the central securities register as a holder
of Silverstone Shares and Silver Wheaton shall be recorded as the registered
holder of the Silverstone Shares so transferred and shall be deemed to be the
legal owner of such Silverstone Shares;

 

(d)

 

each Silverstone Employee Option outstanding immediately prior to the

immediately before the Effective Time under the Silverstone Stock Option Plan
and the agreement evidencing the grant except to the extent that such
Converted Silver Wheaton Option will expire on the expiry date for such option
(provided that no Converted Silver Wheaton Option will expire as a result of
the holder thereof ceasing to be employed, engaged as a consultant, officer or
director or otherwise in a service relationship with Silverstone, a subsidiary

Effective Date), the number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
Silver Wheaton Shares equal to the product of: (A) the number of Silverstone
Shares subject to such Silverstone Employee Option immediately prior to the

Silver Wheaton Share subject to any such Converted Silver Wheaton Option shall
be the amount (rounded up to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the
quotient of (A) the exercise price per Silverstone Share subject to such
Silverstone Employee Option immediately before the Effective Time divided by

that is two years following the Effective Date, if the holder thereof ceases
to be a consultant of Silverstone as of the Effective Date and does not then

subsidiary of Silver Wheaton on that date), the number (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of Silver Wheaton Shares equal to the product of: (A)
the number of Silverstone Shares subject to such Silverstone Non-Employee
Option, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B)
the Share Exchange Ratio.
