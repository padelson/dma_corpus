in the case of Collection Accounts, additions or attritions) shall not in any
manner modify or limit Buyers' obligations hereunder to purchase the Assets;
provided, however, that such acquisitions, dispositions, additions or
attritions shall not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Sellers'
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Schedules provided for in this
Section 1.1 shall specify the applicable Seller and Buyer for each

other than as set forth on Schedule 1.1(b)(i), Sellers may at their option
cause such Registered Rolling Stock to be sold to the applicable Buyers at

1.5 Non-Assignment of Certain Contracts. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that the assignment hereunder of
any Assumed Contract shall require the consent of any third party, neither
this Agreement nor any action taken pursuant to its provisions
shall constitute an assignment or an agreement to assign if such assignment
or agreement to assign would constitute a breach of such Assumed Contract or
result in the loss or material diminution thereof, provided, however, that
Sellers shall, at the request of the applicable Buyer, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the other party to
such Assumed Contract to an assignment thereof in favor of the applicable
Buyer; further provided, however, that if any Assumed Contract requires
consent for assignment in favor of such Buyer and such consent is not
obtained at or prior to Closing, the applicable Seller shall, to the extent
contractually permitted, enter into an operating agreement with the
applicable Buyer affording such Buyer the rights, benefits and obligations
under such Assumed Contract as if such consent to assignment had been
obtained (each, an "Operating Agreement"). In the event that the consent to
assign such Assumed Contract is obtained, such Assumed Contract thereupon
shall be reasonably promptly assigned from the applicable Seller to the
applicable Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 1.7, if
such accommodation to the applicable Seller under an Operating Agreement is
not contractually permitted, Sellers shall not have any obligations to
provide Buyers with the rights, benefits and obligations under such
Assumed Contract following the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Sellers be obligated to pay
any fees, commissions or other compensation to obtain the consent of a third
party for the assignment hereunder of any Assumed Contract.

 

 

1.6 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price (including
any liabilities that are considered to be an increase to the Purchase Price
for federal income tax purposes) shall be allocated among the Assets in
accordance with the allocation set forth on Schedule 1.6. to be attached
hereto at Closing, which allocation has been determined in accordance with
the requirements of Code Section 1060 and based on the fair market value of
the Assets as determined by arm's length negotiations. Within 45 days after
the Actual True-Up Amount is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.2, RSG
will make any adjustments to the Purchase Price allocation necessary to
reflect such Actual True-Up Amount. The parties agree to file (or cause to be
filed) (i) all required federal Forms 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement under
Section 1060, and (ii) all other Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns
and claims for refund) in a manner consistent with such allocation of the
Purchase Price described in this Section 1.6. The parties agree to refrain
from taking any position that is inconsistent with such allocation, and to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to sustain such allocation in any
subsequent Tax audit or Tax dispute.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 8 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.7 Certain Customer Issues and Asset Reconciliations..

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, following the
date of this Agreement, RSG will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
identify any customer overlap issues with respect to the Customer Accounts
where such customers are both serviced on a route to be divested pursuant to
the Republic/Allied Consent Decree and also are serviced on routes not
being divested, as well as any customer issues relating to National
Accounts (collectively, "Customer Issues"). RSG and WCN agree to mutually
cooperate in good faith to take any actions reasonably necessary to resolve
all Customer Issues prior to the Closing in a manner that results in the
receipt by Buyers of a reasonably like-kind and amount of customers and
revenue relating to the Customer Accounts as is contemplated by this
Agreement and the Republic/Allied Consent Decree.

 

 

(b) If, at any time after the Closing Date, either RSG or WCN determines in
good faith that any Contract (whether or not an Assumed Contract, and
including any Contract right related to a Collection Account, a
Peachland/Angleton Account or a Disposal Account) relates both to the Assets
and to assets, facilities or customers that are not included in the Assets,
the parties will use their good faith efforts to enter into arrangements,
including subcontracting arrangements, bifurcation arrangements, operating
agreements and/or modifications of the applicable Contract, to allocate
reasonably and fairly the benefits and burdens thereof based on the
relationship of such Contract to the Assets and such assets, facilities or
customers. If, at any time prior to or after the Closing Date, either RSG or
WCN identifies any tangible personal property (whether or not listed on the
schedules hereto), Contract right or other asset that RSG or WCN, as the case
may be, reasonably concludes in good faith (i) was included in the
conveyances hereunder by Sellers to Buyers, (ii) was not used or held in
connection with the ownership or operation of the Assets during the
Hold Separate Period, and (iii) was inadvertently conveyed in error by
Sellers to Buyers, the parties will use good faith efforts to cause such
tangible personal property, Contract right or other asset to be reconveyed to
a Seller or, if such conveyance is not reasonably practicable, to enter into
other arrangements affording such Seller the benefit of such tangible
personal property or Contract right. If, at any time after the Closing Date,
RSG or WCN identifies any tangible personal property, Contract right (whether
or not listed on the schedules hereto) or other asset that that RSG or WCN,
as the case may be, reasonably concludes in good faith (i) was not included
in the conveyances hereunder by Sellers to Buyers, (ii) was used or held in
connection with the ownership or operation of the Assets during the Hold
Separate Period, and (iii) was inadvertently omitted in error from the
conveyances hereunder by Sellers to Buyers, the parties will use good faith
efforts to cause such tangible personal property, Contract right or other
asset to be conveyed to a Buyer or, if such conveyance is not reasonably
practicable, to enter into other arrangements affording such Buyer the
benefit of such tangible personal property or Contract right. Unless
otherwise agreed, neither Buyers nor Sellers shall be entitled to any
additional compensation for any conveyances made pursuant to this
Section 1.7(b).

ARTICLE II

 

 

PURCHASE PRICE AND CLOSING

 

 

2.1 Purchase Price. Subject to adjustment as provided in this Article II and
Section 9.7, at the Closing, Buyers shall pay to Sellers the aggregate
amount (the "Closing Purchase Price") of $313,160,000 (Three Hundred and
Thirteen Million One Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, plus or minus an amount equal to the estimated
net aggregate sum of the following items as of the Closing Date as determined
under Section 2.2(b) (collectively, the "Estimated True-Up Amount"): (a) the
estimated A/R Value as of the Closing Date; plus (b) the estimated total
amount of Prepaid Assets as of the Closing Date; minus (c) the estimated
total amount of Deferred Revenue as of the Closing Date; and minus (d) the
estimated total amount of Customer Deposits as of the Closing Date.
The Closing Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to this Article II and
Section 9.7, is referred to herein as the "Purchase Price."

 

 

2.2 Pre-Closing Adjustment.

 

 

(a) The following capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
following meanings:

 

 

(i) "Baseline EBITDA Amount" means the pro forma EBITDA projected to be
generated by the ownership and/or operation of the Assets during the one-year
period immediately following the Closing, as calculated in accordance with
the terms of this Section 2.2 and Schedule 2.2(e) hereto;

 

 

(ii) "EBITDA" means the cumulative consolidated earnings generated from the
ownership or operation of the Assets before interest income,
interest expense, Taxes, depreciation and amortization, determined in
accordance with GAAP, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.2 and Schedules 2.2(e) and 2.3(e), as applicable;

 

 

(iii) "EBITDA Adjustment Amount" means the amount (which may be positive or
negative), if any, by which the WCN Baseline EBITDA Amount is more than
$1,500,000 greater than the RSG Baseline EBITDA Amount (a "Positive EBITDA
Amount") or more than $1,500,000 less than the RSG Baseline EBITDA Amount (a
"Negative EBITDA Amount"). For instance, if the WCN Baseline EBITDA Amount is
$1,550,000 greater than the RSG Baseline EBITDA, then the Positive EBITDA
Amount would be $50,000; and if the WCN Baseline EBITDA Amount is $1,550,000
less than the RSG Baseline EBITDA Amount, then the Negative EBITDA Amount
would be $50,000. For purposes of calculating the EBITDA Adjustment Amount,
if (A) a Positive EBITDA Amount exists, and the surplus is attributable to
more than one collection, transfer station or landfill Asset included within
the Assets, then such Positive EBITDA Amount shall automatically be deemed
allocated first to the individual collection, transfer station or landfill
Asset that has the largest EBITDA surplus and then such allocation shall
automatically continue in descending order to the remaining individual
collection, transfer station or landfill Assets that have an EBITDA surplus
until such Positive EBITDA Amount has been fully allocated to all such
Assets; and (B) a Negative EBITDA Amount exists, and the shortfall is
attributable to more than one collection, transfer station or landfill Asset
included within the Assets, then such Negative EBITDA Amount shall
automatically be deemed allocated first to the individual collection,
transfer station or landfill Asset that has the largest EBITDA shortfall and
then such allocation shall automatically continue in descending order to the
remaining individual collection, transfer station or landfill Assets that
have an EBITDA shortfall until such Negative EBITDA Amount has been fully
allocated to all such Assets; and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 10 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) "RSG Baseline EBITDA Amount" means $48,840,000, which is RSG's good
faith estimate of the Baseline EBITDA Amount as of the date of this
Agreement.

 

 

(b) During the 30-day period immediately following the date of this Agreement
(the "EBITDA Due Diligence Period"), RSG shall furnish WCN with all
reasonably available information related to the calculation of the RSG
Baseline EBITDA Amount, and provide WCN with access to the Assets to the
extent reasonably relevant to the calculation of the RSG Baseline EBITDA
Amount. As promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the end of the
EBITDA Due Diligence Period, WCN shall, subject to and in accordance with the
terms of Section 2.2(e) and Schedule 2.2(e), provide RSG in writing with
its own good faith determination as to the Baseline EBITDA Amount (the
"WCN Baseline EBITDA Amount") allocable to each collection, transfer
station and landfill Asset, including the EBITDA allocable to the Gulf Coast
Disposal Authority Contract (the "Gulf Coast EBITDA"), together with a
reasonably detailed statement of how WCN determined such WCN Baseline EBITDA
Amount (the "WCN Baseline EBITDA Statement"). The WCN Baseline EBITDA
Statement shall separately set forth the following (the "Pre-
Closing Adjustment Calculations"):

 

 

(i) In accordance with Section 2.2(a)(iii), the portion of Positive EBITDA
Amount or Negative EBITDA Amount allocable to each collection, transfer
station and landfill Asset (each, a "Specific EBITDA Allocation");

 

 

(ii) with respect to each Specific EBITDA Allocation, an adjustment multiple
of (A) 5.5, to the extent that such Specific EBITDA Allocation is comprised
of EBITDA attributable to business other than landfill special waste or
landfill special event volumes (the "Ordinary Multiple"), or (B) 4.0, to
the extent that such Specific EBITDA Allocation is comprised of EBITDA
attributable to landfill special waste or landfill special event volumes (the
"Special Multiple"); provided, however, that to the extent any Specific
EBITDA Allocation is comprised of EBITDA subject to both the Ordinary
Multiple and the Special Multiple, then both the Ordinary Multiple and
Special Multiple shall be applied to such Specific EBITDA Allocation in the
same proportion as each type of waste comprises such Specific EBITDA
Allocation; and

 

 

(iii) with respect to any EBITDA Adjustment Amount, the Purchase Price
adjustment applicable shall be calculated as the aggregate of (A) each
Specific EBITDA Allocation multiplied by (B) the Ordinary Multiple or
Special Multiple, as applicable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 11 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The WCN Baseline EBITDA Statement shall be deemed accepted by RSG, unless
RSG establishes that WCN did not satisfy the requirements of Section 2.2(b)
and Schedule 2.2(e) in any material respect and notifies WCN thereof, within
10 Business Days after receiving the WCN Baseline EBITDA Statement. Such
notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of how RSG determined
that the WCN EBITDA Statement did not satisfy the requirements of
Section 2.2(b) and Schedule 2.2(e). RSG and WCN shall thereafter negotiate
in good faith and attempt to resolve their disagreement relating to the WCN
Baseline EBITDA Statement. Should such negotiations not result in an
agreement within 10 Business Days after delivery of RSG's notice, the issues
remaining in dispute shall be submitted to an industry expert knowledgeable
in such matters and mutually agreeable to RSG and WCN (the "Expert").
The Expert shall resolve the Parties disagreements relating to the WCN
Baseline EBITDA Statement and adjust the Pre-Closing Adjustment Calculations
to reflect such resolution; provided, however, that the Expert's
determination shall not result in an EBITDA determination (with respect to
any collection, transfer station or landfill Asset) outside of the EBITDA
range for any such collection, transfer station or landfill Asset established
by RSG's and WCN's respective EBITDA determinations. The Expert's
determination shall include a worksheet setting forth all material
calculations used in arriving at such determination and shall be based solely
on information provided to the Expert by RSG and WCN or their respective
Affiliates) of the disputed items, including the WCN Baseline EBITDA Amount,
the Pre-Closing Adjustment Calculations and the related calculations set
forth in the WCN Baseline EBITDA Statement. The Expert shall deliver his
written determination within 30 days of receipt of the matter, and the
Expert's determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties.
RSG and WCN shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Expert such work
papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as
they may deem necessary or appropriate or as the Expert may request and that
are available to that Party or its agents. Further, RSG and WCN shall be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Expert any material relating to
the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the Expert,
provided, however, that no Party shall have any discussions with the Expert
without first providing the other parties with notice of such discussions and
a reasonable opportunity to attend, observe or otherwise participate in such
discussions. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, performed by
the Expert will be borne equally by RSG and WCN.

 

 

(d) If the EBITDA Adjustment Amount is a Positive EBITDA Amount, then the
Purchase Price payable by Buyers to Sellers at Closing shall be increased by
the amount of the net aggregate Purchase Price adjustments set forth in the
Pre-Closing Adjustment Calculations. If the EBITDA Adjustment Amount is
a Negative EBITDA Amount, then the Purchase Price payable by Buyers to
Sellers at Closing shall be decreased by the amount of the net aggregate
Purchase Price adjustments set forth in the Pre-Closing
Adjustment Calculations.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) there
shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2(d)
if the WCN Baseline EBITDA Amount is not more than $1,500,000 greater than
or $1,500,000 less than the RSG Baseline EBITDA Amount, (ii) in no event
shall the Closing Purchase Price as adjusted by this Section 2.2
and Sections 2.3(e) and (f) be less than $290,000,000, and (iii) RSG and
WCN agree that all calculations, computations and determinations with respect
to the WCN EBITDA Baseline Amount pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall be
made strictly in accordance with the terms of Schedule 2.2(e) hereto.

2.3 Post-Closing Adjustments.

 

 

(a) The following capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
following meanings:

 

 

(i) "Actual True-Up Amount" means the net aggregate sum of the actual amounts
of the following items as of the Closing Date, as determined in accordance
with this Section 2.3: (a) the actual A/R Value as of the Closing Date;
plus (b) the actual amount of the Prepaid Assets as of the Closing Date;
minus (c) the actual amount of the Deferred Revenue as of the Closing Date
and minus (d) the actual amount of the Customer Deposits as of the
Closing Date;

 

 

(ii) "Adjustment Amount" means an amount (which may be positive or negative)
equal to the amount by which the Actual True-Up Amount as of Closing is
different from the Estimated True-Up Amount;

 

 

(iii) "A/R Value" means, with respect to a particular date, the value of
the Accounts Receivable as of such date reduced in accordance with the
following formula: (A) for all Accounts Receivable less than 90 days old,
0% reduction; (B) for all Accounts Receivable from 90 to 120 days old,
50% reduction and (C) for all Accounts Receivable more than 120 days old,
100% reduction; and

 

 

(iv) "Disposal EBITDA" means, the EBITDA reflected in the WCN Baseline EBITDA
Statement attributable to a transfer station or landfill Asset.

 

 

(b) At least 5 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver
to Buyers a worksheet setting forth their good faith estimate of the
Estimated True-Up Amount as of the Closing Date. If the Estimated True-Up
Amount is a positive number, as contemplated by Section 2.2, the amount
payable by Buyers to Sellers at Closing shall be increased in an amount equal
to the positive Estimated True-Up Amount. If the Estimated True-up Amount is
a negative number, as contemplated by Section 2.2, the amount payable by
Buyers to Sellers at Closing shall be decreased in an amount equal to the
negative Estimated True-Up Amount.

 

 

(c) Within 90 days after the Closing, RSG shall prepare a computation of the
Actual True-Up Amount and the Adjustment Amount as of the Closing Date and
deliver such computation to WCN. If within 30 days following delivery of
such computation, WCN does not deliver a written objection thereto to RSG,
then the Actual True-Up Amount and the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to
be agreed-to between the parties as reflected on the computation provided
pursuant to the preceding sentence. If WCN object in writing to the
computation within 30 days following the delivery of such computation, then
RSG and WCN shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve
their disagreement. Should such negotiations not result in an
agreement within 30 days after delivery of such written objection, the issues
remaining in dispute shall be submitted to a neutral auditor mutually
agreeable to RSG and WCN (the "Neutral Auditor"). RSG and WCN shall furnish
or cause to be furnished to the Neutral Auditor such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues as they may deem
necessary or appropriate or as the Neutral Auditor may request and that are
available to that Party or its agents. Further, RSG and WCN shall be afforded
the opportunity to present to the Neutral Auditor any material relating to
the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the Neutral Auditor,
provided, however, that no Party shall have any discussions with the Neutral
Auditor without first providing the other parties with notice of such
discussions and a reasonable opportunity to attend, observe or otherwise
participate in such discussions. All fees and expenses relating to the work,
if any, performed by the Neutral Auditor will be borne equally by WCN
and RSG. The Neutral Auditor will deliver to WCN and RSG a
written determination (which determination shall include a worksheet setting
forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and
shall be based solely on information provided to the Neutral Auditor by WCN
and RSG or their respective Affiliates) of the disputed items, including the
Actual True-Up Amount and the Adjustment Amount, within 30 days of receipt of
the disputed items, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive
on the parties.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 13 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Promptly following agreement on, or delivery of the final, binding and
conclusive computation setting forth, the Actual True-Up Amount and the
Adjustment Amount, Buyers and Sellers shall account to each other as provided
for in this Section 2.3(d). If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
then Buyers shall pay Sellers a cash payment equal to such difference as an
increase in the Purchase Price. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, then Sellers shall pay Buyers a cash payment equal to such difference
as decrease in the Purchase Price. Any such payment shall be due and payable
within 10 days after the final determination of the Adjustment
Amount pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and shall be paid in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to an account designated by Buyers or Sellers,
as applicable.

 

 

(e) In the event that (i) the Purchase Price is reduced pursuant to
Section 2.2(d) and (ii) some or all of such reduction is caused by a
shortfall in EBITDA generated by transfer station and landfill Assets,
as reflected on the Specific EBITDA Allocation Statement, then RSG and WCN
agree that they shall determine the actual EBITDA ("Post-Closing Disposal
EBITDA") related to such Assets. Within 45 days following the expiration of
the Post-Closing Measurement Period (as defined below), the Post-Closing
Disposal EBITDA shall be calculated, in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.3(e) and Schedule 2.3(e), for the 12-month period commencing on
the first day of the month immediately following the Closing Date and ending
on the first anniversary thereof (the "Post-Closing Measurement Period"). In
the event that the Post-Closing Disposal EBITDA for any transfer station or
landfill Asset is greater than the Disposal EBITDA for such transfer station
or landfill Asset, Buyers shall pay Sellers a cash payment equal to the
aggregate of the amount of each such increase in EBITDA multiplied by the
Ordinary Multiple or Special Multiple, as applicable. Any such payment shall
be due and payable within 10 business days after the final determination of
Post-Closing Disposal EBITDA pursuant to this Section 2.3(e). WCN shall, on
a quarterly basis during the Post-Closing Measurement Period, provide RSG
with interim statements of Post-Closing Disposal EBITDA as of such dates,
together with a reasonably detailed description of how such Post-Closing
Disposal EBITDA was calculated, including any adjustments from actual
historical financial statements. For the avoidance of doubt, there shall only
be upward adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to this
Section 2.3(e).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 14 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Post-Closing Seabreeze/Gulf Coast EBITDA Adjustment. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that if, as of the Closing Date or during the
12-month period following immediately thereafter, the Buyers have not entered
into (or become the beneficiary of) a new disposal agreement (or extension of
the existing disposal agreement) with the Gulf Coast Disposal Authority for
a minimum of 12 months following the Closing Date, then the Parties agree
that they shall determine the actual EBITDA of the Seabreeze Landfill (the
"Post-Closing Seabreeze EBITDA"). Within 45 days following the expiration
of the Post-Closing Measurement Period, the Post-Closing Seabreeze EBITDA
shall be calculated, in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.3(f) and
Schedule 2.3(e), for the Post-Closing Measurement Period. In the event that
the Post-Closing Seabreeze EBITDA is greater than the Seabreeze
EBITDA included in the WCN Baseline EBITDA Statement, Buyers shall pay
Sellers a cash payment equal to the aggregate of the amount of such increase
in EBITDA multiplied by the Ordinary Multiple or Special Multiple, as
applicable; provided, however, that appropriate adjustment shall be made so
that the foregoing increase in EBITDA (and any payment made pursuant to this
Section 2.3(f) in respect thereof) shall not be counted twice for purposes of
the EBITDA calculation (and payment in respect thereof) to be made pursuant
to Section 2.3(e). In the event that the Post-Closing Seabreeze EBITDA
is less than the Seabreeze EBITDA included in the WCN Baseline EBITDA
Statement, Sellers shall pay Buyers a cash payment equal to the aggregate of
the amount of such decrease in EBITDA multiplied by 4; provided, however,
that the amount of such decrease in EBITDA, for purposes of this
Section 2.3(f), shall not exceed the amount of the Prorated Gulf Coast
EBITDA Loss. "Prorated Gulf Coast EBITDA Loss" means the Gulf Coast EBITDA
reflected in the WCN Baseline EBITDA Statement multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the 12-month period following
the Closing Date for which any Buyer was not a party to, or beneficiary of,
the Gulf Coast Contract, and the denominator of which is 365. Any such
payment shall be due and payable within 10 Business Days after the final
determination of Post-Closing Seabreeze EBITDA for the Post-Closing
Measurement Period pursuant to this Section 2.3(f). Any payment due from
Sellers to Buyers pursuant to this Section shall be netted against any
payment due from Buyers to Sellers pursuant to Section 2.3(e). WCN shall, on
a quarterly basis during the Post-Closing Measurement Period, provide RSG
with interim statements of Post-Closing Seabreeze EBITDA as of such dates,
together with a reasonably detailed description of how such Post-Closing
Seabreeze EBITDA was calculated, including any adjustments from actual
historical financial statements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, including this Section 2.3(f), in no event
shall Sellers be required to make any payments pursuant to this
Section 2.3(f) that would result in a Purchase Price of less
than $290,000,000.

 

 

(g) In furtherance of Sections 2.3(e) and 2.3(f), WCN covenants and agrees
that, during the Post-Closing Measurement Period, it shall cause Buyers to
(A) conduct business in a commercially reasonable manner in order to maximize
Post-Closing Disposal EBITDA, including, without limitation, Post-Closing
Seabreeze EBITDA, (B) not divert landfill volumes or discount disposal rates
other than in the ordinary course of business or (C) otherwise take or fail
to take any action outside the ordinary course of business which is
reasonably likely to reduce Post-Closing Disposal EBITDA, including, without
limitation, Post-Closing Seabreeze EBITDA, below the amount it would
otherwise be but for having taken or failed to take such action.

 

 

2.4 Closing. The closing of the purchase and sale provided for in this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Akerman
Senterfitt and Eidson, P.A., One Southeast Third Avenue, Suite 2500, Miami,
Florida 33131 at 10:00 a.m., local time, as promptly as practicable (but in
any event within 10 Business Days) following the date on which the last of
the conditions set forth in Article VII are fulfilled, satisfied or waived or
at such other time or place as RSG and WCN shall agree in writing. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date." All
proceedings to be taken and all documents to be executed and delivered by all
parties at the Closing will be deemed to have been taken, executed and
delivered simultaneously and no proceedings will be deemed to have been taken
nor documents executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and
delivered; provided, however, that, for financial reporting purposes only,
the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred effective as of 12:01 a.m. on
the Closing Date.

RSG or the applicable Seller Affiliate thereof; and

 

 

(j) A transition services agreement, the form of which will be mutually

further agree that, without the prior written consent of Sellers, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, they will not contact any Offered
Employees (including managers, supervisors and other personnel key to the
management and operations of the Assets) prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that Sellers shall make reasonably available to Buyers
all of Sellers' non-management employees (and their respective Employee
Records) who are employed in connection with the operations of the Assets no
later than 10 Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date and shall
make reasonably available to Buyers all of Sellers' management employees who

the Closing, no press release, written communication, public announcement,
statement or filing shall be issued or made by any Seller, on the one hand,
or any Buyer, on the other hand, containing information regarding this
Agreement or the Transactions (including the fact that the Transactions are
being discussed or the terms of the Transactions) without the prior written
approval of both RSG and WCN, which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, WCN and RSG
agree, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, not to make this Agreement

hereto in any filing by WCN with the SEC before such date. The parties shall
consult with each other concerning the means by which Sellers' employees,
customers and suppliers and others having dealings with Sellers will be

6.9 Supplements to the Sellers' Disclosure Schedules; Certain Pre-
Closing Matters.

 

 

(a) Except for Schedules 1.1(c)(i), 1.1(c)(ii) and 1.1(c)(iii) which will
be updated within 5 Business Days following the Closing Date in accordance
with Sections 1.1(c)(i), 1.1(c)(ii) and 1.1(c)(iii), respectively, at any
time prior to the date that is 5 Business Days prior to the Closing and upon
written notice thereof to Buyers, Sellers may, in their sole discretion,
deliver to Buyers one or more supplements to the Sellers' Disclosure Schedule
(each such supplement, a "Supplemental Sellers' Disclosure Schedule") with
respect to any fact(s), circumstance(s) or matter(s) arising after the date
of this Agreement that, if existing or known by Sellers prior to the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Sellers' Disclosure Schedules. With respect to any fact, circumstance or
matter disclosed in a Supplemental Sellers' Disclosure Schedule, subject to
this Section 6.9(a): (i) any such fact, circumstance or matter (A) that first
arose after the date of this Agreement, and (B) of which no Seller had any
Knowledge on or prior to the date of this Agreement, shall become an Assumed
Liability and shall be treated as if it had been fully disclosed on Sellers'
Disclosure Schedules on the date hereof for the purposes of determining
whether any representation or warranty of Sellers has been breached for
indemnification purposes under Article IX hereof; (ii) any such fact,
circumstance or matter (A) that first arose on or prior the date of this
Agreement, or (B) of which a Seller had or should have had Knowledge on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, shall be treated as if it had not been
disclosed on Sellers' Disclosure Schedules on the date hereof for the
purposes of determining whether any representation or warranty of Sellers has
been breached for indemnification purposes under Article IX hereof; and (iii)
any fact(s), circumstance(s) or matter(s) disclosed by a Supplemental
Sellers' Disclosure Schedule may be disregarded by Buyer for purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) has been
satisfied, and may be taken into account by Buyers for purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in Section 7.2(e) has been
satisfied. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.9(a) to the
contrary, regardless of any disclosure made by Sellers on any Sellers'
Disclosure Schedule or Supplemental Sellers' Disclosure Schedule, in no event
shall Buyers be liable (and Sellers' shall remain solely liable) for any
fact, circumstance or matter that is an Excluded Liability, an
Absolute Obligation or constitutes a breach of any covenant or obligation
under this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (i) any
fact(s), circumstance(s) or matter(s) that were not disclosed in the Sellers'
Disclosure Schedules as of the date hereof and that arise after the date of
this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) such fact(s),
circumstance(s) or matter(s) result in, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, Liabilities arising from Proceedings, Permits, Assumed Contracts,
Real Property, Taxes or Environmental Laws, and (iii) such Liabilities would
constitute Assumed Liabilities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement upon
the consummation of the Closing, then RSG shall promptly (but in any event
within 15 days), notify WCN in writing that it has learned of such fact(s),
circumstance(s) or matter(s). If WCN concludes in good faith, after
reasonably diligent review, that such fact(s), circumstance(s) or matter(s)
described in the immediately preceding sentence have resulted in, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, Liabilities equal to or in excess of $5
million individually or $10 million in the aggregate (the "Pre-
Closing Caps"), then WCN shall have 15 days from the receipt of such
written notice from RSG to notify RSG that it intends to terminate this
Agreement (the "WCN Pre-Closing Termination Notice") unless RSG, in its sole
discretion, provides written notice to WCN within 10 days of RSG's receipt of
the WCN Pre-Closing Termination Notice stating that it agrees to fully
indemnify WCN for such Liabilities under the terms of Article IX (the
"RSG Pre-Closing Indemnification Notice"). Such WCN Pre-Closing Termination
Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail WCN's basis for determining that
such Liabilities have equaled or exceeded, or could reasonably be expected to
equal or exceed, the Pre-Closing Caps. In the event that RSG timely provides
the RSG Pre-Closing Indemnification Notice pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Liabilities described in this Section 6.9(b) shall be
deemed to be Absolute Obligations of Sellers. In the event that RSG, in its
sole discretion, elects not to provide the RSG Pre-Closing Indemnification
Notice, WCN may, in its sole discretion, elect to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
this Section 6.9(b) apply to any fact, circumstance or matter that is an
Excluded Liability, an Absolute Obligation (without giving effect to this
Section 6.9(b)) or constitutes a breach of any covenant or obligation under
this Agreement.

6.10 Employees and Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyers shall offer employment to the
employees of Sellers listed on Schedule 6.10(a) and who remain actively
employed by a Seller as of such date (each, an "Offered Employee") on terms
(position, salary or hourly wage rate, bonus, health and welfare benefits,
etc.) similar to those in effect immediately prior to Closing for similarly
situated employees of Buyers; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyers may decline to offer employment to (i) up to an aggregate
of 5 of the employees of Sellers listed on Schedule 6.10(a) so long as Buyers
have valid business reasons (which may include any position that WCN deems
redundant or unnecessary) for doing so as reasonably approved by RSG and (ii)
an unlimited number of such employees who fail to satisfy Buyers' pre-
employment screening policies (provided that WCN shall provide RSG with a
reasonably detailed description of the circumstances with respect to such
failure for each such employee). For purposes of this Agreement, any Offered
Employee who is not actively at work on the Closing Date because of vacation,
holiday, personal leave, sick or medical leave, maternity, paternity or other
family-related leave, military leave, jury duty, bereavement leave or any
other leave shall be deemed an Offered Employee. Each Offered Employee who
accepts any Buyer's offer of employment is referred to as
a "Transferred Employee." On or prior to the Closing Date, each Seller
shall have terminated each of its Transferred Employees. Sellers
shall update Schedule 6.10(a) at Closing to reflect those Offered Employees
who remain actively employed by Sellers as of such date (including any
Offered Employees on leave as of such date).

 

 

(b) As of the Closing, Buyer shall assume the severance and retention and
stay bonus obligations for the Transferred Employees described on
Schedule 6.10(b) (the "Assumed Severance and Retention Bonus Liabilities"),
which Schedule 6.10(b) shall be updated by Sellers at Closing. Except for
the Assumed Severance and Retention Bonus Liabilities, Sellers shall retain
sole responsibility for all (i) accrued payroll and bonuses and accrued but
unused vacation, sick or personal days of each Offered Employee as of the
Closing Date and (ii) obligations, claims, liabilities and commitments under
Sellers' Benefit Plans and compensation practices, including severance
benefits, if any, payable to Offered Employees who are not Transferred
Employees as a result of the Transactions. Sellers shall retain all
liabilities and obligations to all of Sellers' employees and former
employees, including Offered Employees and their eligible dependents in
respect of health insurance continuation coverage required by the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and similar state Applicable Law.

(c) Buyers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and
assist Sellers in eliminating the need for Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act and any similar state Applicable Law
(collectively, the "WARN Act") notifications. If, notwithstanding Buyers'
compliance with the preceding sentence of this Section 6.10(c), WARN Act
notification is nonetheless required, Sellers agree to provide any required
notice under the WARN Act, and any similar state Applicable Law, and to
otherwise comply with any such Applicable Law with respect to any "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination
or similar event affecting Offered Employees occurring prior to or as a
result of the consummation of the Transactions (without taking into
account any termination by Buyers of the employment of any Transferred
Employees following the Closing).

 

 

(d) All Offered Employees who are employed by Buyers from and after the
Closing shall be given credit for their years of service with Sellers in
determining their entitlement to Buyers' severance and other length-of-
service related employee benefits. Buyers shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to ensure that all Transferred Employees are eligible to be
enrolled in all applicable Benefit Plans of Buyers effective as of the
Closing and are enrolled as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing (but in no event later than 15 Business Days following the Closing
Date), and shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that, to the
fullest extent permitted under such Benefit Plans, any probationary or
waiting periods, or eligibility requirements, applicable under any such
Benefit Plans are waived with respect to the Transferred Employees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to ensure that all Transferred Employees are enrolled in all
applicable Benefit Plans of Buyers providing health, medical and similar
benefits (the "Medical Plans") effective as of the Closing and shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that any probationary or waiting
periods, or eligibility requirements, applicable under any such Medical Plans
are waived with respect to the Transferred Employees.

 

 

(e) Pursuant to the "Alternate Procedure" provided in Section 5 of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, 2004-34 IRB 320, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Laws, (i) Sellers and Buyers shall report on a predecessor/successor basis as
set forth therein, (ii) Sellers will be relieved from filing a Form W-2 with
respect to any Transferred Employees for the year that includes the Closing
Date, (iii) Buyers will undertake to file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2
for each such Transferred Employee with respect to the entire year (including
the portion during which such Transferred Employees are employed by Sellers)
that includes the Closing Date, and (iv) Sellers agree to cooperate with
Buyers and, upon request from Buyers, provide Buyers with information
relating to the period during which the Transferred Employees are employed by
Sellers.

and the consummation of the Transactions (the "DOJ Consent").

 

 

6.12 Notice of Developments.. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyers of any
facts, circumstances or matters arising after the date of this Agreement that
Sellers become aware of that could reasonably be expected to have a Sellers'
Material Adverse Effect. The parties hereto agree to give prompt notice to
each other of, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to, remedy (a) the
occurrence or failure to occur of any event which occurrence or failure to
occur would be likely to cause any of its or their representations or
warranties in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at the Closing Date (with respect to Sellers, after giving effect to
Section 6.9), and (b) any material failure on its or their part to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it or them hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.
During the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
Sellers' Representative shall provide written notice to Buyers in the event
that (i) any transfer station or landfill (other than the Brent Run Landfill)
receives notice of the loss or termination of any Material Disposal Contract
or (ii) the Seller that operates the Brent Run Landfill receives notice of
the loss or termination of any Disposal Contract from which such Seller
billed revenues of more than $250,000 for the twelve (12) months ended
December 31, 2008.

 

 

6.13 Reasonable Commercial Efforts. Buyers and Sellers shall each use
their reasonable commercial efforts to cause the conditions in Article VII

Agreement.

Buyers or their Affiliates to such Disposal Account following the Closing are
materially less favorable than the disposal terms in existence as of the

boxes; (ii) made through any "ez-pay" or other electronic or telephonic

reasonable efforts to satisfy the Specified Title Requirements.

Property shall not be used as a site where solid waste (including yard waste,
demolition materials and household or commercial refuse) is loaded, unloaded,
collected, sorted or transferred in preparation for processing or transfer to
landfills and/or other waste disposal sites. The foregoing deed restriction
(the "Lubbock Deed Restriction") shall be a covenant running with the land
and binding upon the parties hereto and their successors and assigns in
perpetuity or until revoked or modified in whole or in part by grantor, its
successors or assigns, in its sole and absolute discretion.

(b) By either WCN or RSG by written notice to the other:

 

 

(i) if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued
an order, decree, judgment or injunction or taken any other action (which

Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party

material breach of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement and if any Seller breaches or fails to perform in
any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) and (B) cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if

any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) and (B) cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if
capable of being cured, has not been cured within 30 days after the giving by
RSG of written notice to WCN of such breach or failure, or (ii) Buyers fail
to consummate the Closing within 10 Business Days of written notice from RSG
to WCN that all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 have been
satisfied and that all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3 have been

8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Sections 8.1(a), 8.1(b) or 8.1(e) , this Agreement shall thereafter
become null and void, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of any of the parties (or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents or other representatives or Affiliates), except that (a)
the provisions of Article X, Section 12.4 and Article XIII shall survive
such termination, and (b) such termination shall not relieve any party of any
liability for any willful material breach of this Agreement or for Fraud
Claims. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d),
(a) the provisions of Article X, Section 12.4 and Article XIII shall
survive such termination, (b) Buyers shall have no further rights and may
assert no Liabilities whatsoever against Sellers or any of their respective
assets, trustees, directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members
or shareholders with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and (c)
Sellers shall be entitled to recover from Buyers and any other parties liable
therefor (whether directly, by way of guaranty, by or through piercing of the
corporate veil, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable
Law or theory of recovery, or otherwise) any damages caused by such breach,
and to obtain any and all other legal and equitable relief whatsoever,
including specific performance, against Buyers and any such other parties
that may be available to them at law or in equity. If this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c), (a) the provisions of
Article X, Section 12.4 and Article XIII shall survive such termination,
(b) Sellers shall have no further rights and may assert no Liabilities
whatsoever against Buyers or any of their respective assets, trustees,
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or shareholders
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and (c) Buyers shall be
entitled to recover from Sellers and any other parties liable therefor
(whether directly, by way of guaranty, by or through piercing of the
corporate veil, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable
Law or theory of recovery, or otherwise) any damages caused by such breach,
and to obtain any and all other legal and equitable relief whatsoever,
including specific performance, against Sellers and any such other parties
that may be available to them at law or in equity. The breaching party
shall further be liable to and reimburse the non-breaching party for all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred or accrued by the non-breaching party
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of this Section 8.2, including reasonable
costs and expenses of collecting amounts due pursuant to this sentence. In no
event shall any party be liable under any legal theory for any special,
indirect, punitive, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages, however
caused, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, even if such party has
been advised of the possibility of such damages; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the immediately foregoing sentence, nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prevent either Buyers or Sellers from recovering against
Sellers or Buyers, as the case may be, their full respective benefit of the
bargain as contemplated under the terms of this Agreement in the event of
a breach hereof (including, in the event of a breach by Buyers, any
damages Sellers may incur as a result of the future resale of the Assets in
one or more transactions at a price lower than the Purchase Price). Each
of Buyers and Sellers acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the Transactions.

\- 43 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) All other representations and warranties of Sellers shall survive

Sellers and Buyers shall survive Closing without limitation as to time until

(b) Sellers and Buyers shall not have any liability under Sections 9.2 and
9.3, respectively, unless a claim for losses, liabilities or damages for
which indemnification is sought thereunder is asserted by the respective
party within the survival period set forth above, provided, however, that
the timely written assertion of any claim by any such party against
the Sellers or Buyers hereunder with respect to the breach or alleged breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant shall extend the survival period
with respect to such claim through the date such claim is
conclusively resolved.

 

 

9.2 Indemnification by Sellers. Subject to the terms of Sections 9.4, 10.3
and 10.4, Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend (as to
Third-Party Claims only), protect, and hold harmless Buyers and their
respective Affiliates at all times from and after the Closing Date from and
against all Liabilities, whether equitable or legal, matured or
contingent, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, ordinary or
extraordinary or patent or latent, incurred by Buyers as a result of or
incident to (a) any breach of, misrepresentation in, untruth in or inaccuracy
in any of the representations and warranties of any Seller in this Agreement
or any agreement, document, instrument or certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, (b) the breach or nonperformance of any covenant or agreement
of any Seller in this Agreement, (c) any Excluded Asset, (d) any Excluded
Liability, (e) the failure to satisfy the Specified Title Requirements in
accordance with Section 6.25, or (f) the costs of implementing the proposal

9.3 Indemnification by Buyers. Subject to the terms of Sections 9.4, 10.3
and 10.4, Buyers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend (as to
Third-Party Claims only), protect and hold harmless Sellers and their
respective Affiliates at all times from and after the Closing Date from and
against all Liabilities, whether equitable or legal, matured or
contingent, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, ordinary or
extraordinary, patent or latent, incurred by Sellers as a result of or
incident to (a) any breach of, misrepresentation in, untruth in or inaccuracy
in any of the representations and warranties of any Buyer in this Agreement
or any agreement, document, instrument or certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, (b) the breach or nonperformance of any covenant or agreement
of Buyers in this Agreement, (c) from and after the Closing Date, any Asset
or (d) any Assumed Liability.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 44 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.4 Limitation on Liability.

 

 

(a) The indemnification obligations set forth in Article IX shall (i) apply
only if a Closing occurs, (ii) apply only after the aggregate amount of
claims for indemnification from the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement
exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), and thereafter the
Indemnifying Party shall solely be liable for indemnification obligations in
excess of the Deductible, provided, however, that only claims, or series of
related claims, equal to or in excess of $150,000 shall apply toward the
Deductible and/or be indemnifiable after the Deductible has been exceeded
(the "Minimum Claim Amount"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Deductible nor the Minimum Claim Amount shall apply to any indemnification
obligations on account of Fraud Claims or any breach or nonperformance of any
Absolute Obligations. "Absolute Obligations" means, collectively,
the Sellers' Fundamental Representations, the Buyers'
Fundamental Representations and the covenants and obligations set forth in
Sections 1.7, 6.9(b), 6.20, 9.2(c), (d), (e) and (f) and 9.3(c) and (d).

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except with
respect to indemnification obligations arising from or in connection
with Fraud Claims or any breach or nonperformance of any
Absolute Obligations, the maximum aggregate liability of Sellers and
Buyers for Liabilities under this Article IX shall be 15% of the Purchase
Price (the "Cap").

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, there shall
be a single Deductible, Minimum Claim Amount and Cap (without duplication),
respectively, under this Agreement for Buyers and Sellers, respectively, so
that any indemnification obligations incurred by any Indemnifying Party who
is a Seller or a Buyer, as the case may be, shall be cumulatively applied
against the Deductible, Minimum Claim Amount and Cap for the Sellers and
Buyers, respectively, subject in each case to the express conditions,
exceptions and limitations set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyers shall not be entitled to any indemnification for any amounts reflected
in the final Actual True-Up Amount calculation pursuant to Section 2.2.

 

 

(e) Any indemnification payment due and owing by an Indemnifying Party to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX shall be reduced by (i) any
insurance, indemnity, or other payments or recoveries of a like nature with
respect thereto realized by an Indemnified Party (and no right of subrogation
shall accrue hereunder to any insurer) and (ii) the amount of any tax benefit
to the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to the
matter for which indemnification would otherwise be available hereunder
(after giving effect to the tax effect of receipt of the indemnification
payments).

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding any disclosure contained on any Schedule attached hereto
(or otherwise made by any Seller to any Buyer) to qualify any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation, any Liability arising from or in connection
with the subject matter so disclosed that constitutes a Fraud Claim or any
breach or nonperformance of any Absolute Obligations shall be subject to
indemnification by Sellers pursuant to Section 9.2 on the same basis as if
the disclosure had not been made. In the event that a representation
contained in this Agreement is breached and such representation is qualified
by words or phrases such as "material," "Sellers' Material Adverse Effect,"
"Sellers' Material Adverse Condition," "materially," "immaterial,"
"immaterially," "nonmaterial," "substantially," or words of similar import,
such qualifiers shall be disregarded with respect to such breach for purposes
of calculating the amount of any obligation of indemnity arising pursuant to
this Article IX.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 45 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Subject to the terms of Section 8.2, in no event shall any Indemnifying
Party have any Liability under this Agreement resulting from, arising out of,
or relating to the breach of inaccuracy of any representation and warranty
for incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, except to the
extent that such damages are owed or payable to a third party as a result of
or in relation to such breach.

 

 

9.5 Indemnification Procedure Between Buyers and Sellers. Upon the occurrence
of any claim for which indemnification is believed to be due under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall provide notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party, stating in general terms the circumstances giving rise to
the claim, specifying the amount of the claim (or an estimate thereof) and
making a request for any payment then believed due (subject to the
limitations in this Agreement). Upon receipt of any such notice, both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use all reasonable efforts
to cooperate and arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution of such dispute
within the next 30 days. If a resolution is not reached within such 30-day
period, either party may commence the dispute resolution procedures set forth
in Article XIII. If all or a portion of such claim amount is owed to the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall (subject to the terms
of Section 9.4), within 10 days of such determination, pay the Indemnified
Party such amount owed in cash.

 

 

9.6 Procedure for Indemnification with Respect to Third-Party Claims.

 

 

(a) If any third Person shall notify an Indemnified Party with respect to any
matter that may give rise to a claim for indemnification against an
Indemnifying Party (a "Third-Party Claim") or if any party who may make a
claim for indemnification under this Agreement otherwise becomes aware of any
matter that may give rise to such a claim or wishes to make such a claim
(whether or not related to a Third-Party Claim), then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing,
provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligation under this Agreement unless (and then solely to the extent)
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay.

 

 

(b) If an Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant
to Section 9.6(a) of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party
Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless the Indemnifying Party is
also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made joint representation
would be inappropriate due to conflicts of interest), to assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. Except with the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or
litigation, shall consent to entry of any judgment or order, interim or
otherwise, or enter into any settlement that provides for injunctive or other
nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or that does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to
such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with respect to such
claim or litigation. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not
accept the defense of any matter as above provided, the Indemnified Party
shall have the full right to defend against any such claim or demand and
shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such claim or demand. In
any event, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
in the defense of any claim or litigation subject to this Article IX, and
the records and personnel of each shall be reasonably available to the other
with respect to such defense. With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject
to indemnification under this Article IX, the parties agree to cooperate in
such a manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the
confidentiality of all Confidential Information and the attorney-client and
attorney work product privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees
that (i) it will use its commercially reasonable efforts, in respect of any
Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to
avoid production of Confidential Information (consistent with Applicable Law
and rules of procedure) and (ii) all communications between any party
hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve
any applicable attorney-client or attorney work product privilege.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 46 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.7 Tax Treatment of Payment. Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or
unless Sellers and Buyers otherwise mutually agree, any payment made under
this Article IX shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

 

ARTICLE X

 

 

NONDISCLOSURE; REMEDIES

 

 

10.1 Nondisclosure by Buyers. Buyers recognize and acknowledge that,
in connection with the Transactions, Sellers have provided to Buyers and
will provide to them prior to the Closing Date Confidential Information of
Sellers, including lists of customers, operational policies and pricing and
cost policies that are valuable, special and unique assets of Sellers. Buyers
agree that they will not, except as may be required by law or valid legal
process, disclose such Confidential Information to any Person for any purpose
or reason whatsoever, prior to the Closing Date except to authorized
representatives of Buyer, unless such information is or becomes known to the
public generally through no fault of Buyers. The provisions of this
Section 10.1 shall apply at all times prior to the Closing Date and for a
period of one year following the earlier of (i) the Closing Date and (ii)
termination of this Agreement without a Closing having occurred.

 

 

10.2 Confidential Information. Neither Sellers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall at any time subsequent to the Closing, except as
explicitly requested by Buyers or as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
use for any purpose or disclose to any Person any Confidential Information
relating primarily to the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, all such
information being deemed to be transferred to Buyers under this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean
proprietary, non-public information relating primarily to the Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any
information which is or relates to an Excluded Asset or to the Excluded
Liabilities or which relates to Tax matters of Sellers. Both Sellers and
Buyers shall maintain Confidential Information that relates to both Assumed
Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities in duplicate. If, at any time after the
Closing, Sellers should discover that they are in possession of any records
and files containing the Confidential Information of Buyers, then the party
making such discovery shall immediately turn such records and files over to
Buyers, which shall upon request make available to the surrendering party any
information contained therein which is not Confidential Information. Sellers
agree that they will not assert a waiver of loss of confidential or
privileged status of the information based upon such possession or discovery.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 47 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.3 Exclusivity of Remedies. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, except for the terms of Section 8.2, Fraud Claims (except as
otherwise provided in Section 8.2) and equitable or injunctive relief or
claims for specific performance, as applicable, in accordance with the terms
of Section 10.4, following the Closing:

 

 

(a) the sole and exclusive remedies of the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates for (i) any breach or inaccuracy of, or failure to perform, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Buyers contained in this
Agreement, the Schedules attached hereto or any certificated delivered in
connection herewith, and/or (ii) any other Liabilities incurred by Sellers in
connection with this Agreement shall be the indemnification provisions
provided in Article IX.

 

 

(b) the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyers and their respective
Affiliates for (i) any breach or inaccuracy of, or failure to perform, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Sellers contained in this
Agreement, the Schedules attached hereto or any certificated delivered in
connection herewith, and/or (ii) any other Liabilities incurred by Buyers in
connection with this Agreement, shall be the indemnification provisions
provided in Article IX.

 

 

10.4 Equitable Relief for Violations. The parties acknowledge that
an irreparable injury may result to the non-violating party and its business
in the event of a breach by the violating party of any provision in this
Article X. The parties also acknowledge and agree that the damages
or injuries that a non-violating party sustains as a result of such a breach
are difficult to ascertain and money damages alone may not be an adequate
remedy to a non-violating party. The parties therefore expressly agree that
if a controversy arises concerning the rights or obligations of a party under
this Article X, such rights or obligations shall be enforceable by a court
decree of specific performance and a non-violating party shall also be
entitled to any injunctive relief from the court pursuant to Article XIII
necessary to prevent or restrain any such breach. Such relief shall be
granted without the necessity of a showing of irreparable harm and without
the posting of a bond or other security. Such relief, however, shall be
cumulative and non-exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which the parties may be entitled in accordance with this Agreement.

13.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or of any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of Delaware.

 

 

13.3 Attorneys' Fees. Should any litigation or proceeding be commenced
under this Agreement, the successful party in such litigation or proceeding
shall be entitled to recover, in addition to such other relief as the court
may award, its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, litigation
related expenses and court or other costs incurred in such litigation
or proceeding. For purposes of this clause, the term "successful
party" means the net winner of the dispute, taking into account the claims
pursued, the claims on which the pursuing party was successful, the amount of
money sought, the amount of money awarded and offsets or counterclaims
pursued (successfully or unsuccessfully) by the other party. If a written
settlement offer is rejected and the judgment or award finally obtained is
equal to or more favorable to the offeror than an offer made in writing to
settle, the offeror is deemed to be the successful party from the date of the
offer forward.
