Laws except for Article I of the Charter, which shall read in its entirety
as follows: "The name of the corporation is DJO Incorporated."

  

## 2.2 _The By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Surviving

# ARTICLE III

  

# Officers and Directors 
 of the Surviving Corporation

  

## 3.1 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of

## 3.2 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the

# ARTICLE IV

  

# Effect of the MERGER on Capital Stock; 
 Exchange of Certificates

  

## 4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company or their respective stockholders:

  

### (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, $0.01
par value, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (each, an "
_Excluded Share_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall
be converted into the right to receive $50.25 per Share in cash, less any
required withholding Taxes as described in _Section 4.2(f)_ and
without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_
") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without interest.

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in
_Section 4.1(a)_ , except shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of (i) Parent (other than Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation) or (ii) the Company, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall
be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist. Each Share beneficially owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of (i) Parent (other than Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation)
or (ii) the Company shall remain outstanding and no payment shall be made in
respect thereof.

  

### (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
$0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock,
$0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Shares that have not been voted for adoption of
this Agreement and with respect to which appraisal shall have been
properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time unless and until the
holder of such Shares effectively withdraws his demand for such appraisal (in
accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such
appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw (in
accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) his demand for such appraisal or
shall become ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or
the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall cease to be a Dissenting Share and shall be converted
into and represent

        

### the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not make any payments with respect to, or compromise or settle, any demand
for appraisal without the written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who
becomes entitled, pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, to
payment for such Dissenting Shares under the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL shall receive payment thereof from the Surviving Corporation and such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist.

  

## 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates for Shares_.

  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with
the Companys prior approval (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of
the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments under _Section 4.1(a)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under _Section 4.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent.
To the extent that there are losses with respect to any such investments, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make
prompt cash payment under _Section 4.1(a)_ , Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments under _Section
4.1(a)_.

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within five business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) to the
Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_ ) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 4.2(f)_ ) equal to (A) the number of Shares represented by
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section 4.2(e)_ ) multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for

        

### any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

### (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_.

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofor complied with this _ARTICLE IV_
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_ ), without any interest thereon; _provided_ , that such holder of
Shares shall have no greater rights against the Surviving Corporation than
may be accorded to general creditors of the Surviving Corporation under
applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate,
trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any
kind or nature.

  

### (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ) equal to the number of Shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

  

### (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as

        

### having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Surviving
Corporation, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be.

  

## 4.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

  

### (a) _Options_.  At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in
writing by the participant and Parent, each outstanding option to purchase
Shares under the Stock Plans, vested or unvested (a " _Company Option_ "),
shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to the Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess,
if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
Share under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payment.

  

### (b) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and the
compensation and stock option committee of the Company Board, as applicable,
shall adopt resolutions to implement the provisions of _Section 4.3(a)_ , it
being understood that the intention of the parties is that following the
Effective Time no holder of any Company Option or any participant in any
Stock Plan or other employee benefit arrangement of the Company shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock (including any
phantom stock, stock appreciation right or other equity or equity-based
right) of the Company, any Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

Form 8-K previously disclosed to Parent and to be filed in connection with
the announcement of this Agreement (but, in any case, only to the extent (x)
such disclosure does not constitute a "risk factor" or a "forward-
looking statement" under the heading "Forward-Looking Statements" in any of
such Company Reports and (y) the applicability of such disclosure to a
section or subsection of these representations and warranties is reasonably
apparent) or (ii) in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or
subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent except
in the case of the disclosure applicable to qualifying the representation set
forth on

        

 _Section 5.1(f)_  which shall be set forth only on _Section 5.1(f)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter) the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

### (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_.

  

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (x) is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization, (y) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and (z) is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or

of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing (with respect to _clause (z)_ above only), or to have such
power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "
_Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of which
at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their
terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
other persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) "
_Significant Subsidiary_ " is as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X
promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Exchange Act_ ") and (iii) " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means an
event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence (each a " _Change_
") that, when considered individually or in the aggregate with all other
Changes, is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to (x)
the ability of the Company to timely perform its obligations under, and
consummate the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement or (y) the
condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets, liabilities or results
of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
_provided_  that no Change to the extent resulting from the following shall
constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Company Material Adverse Effect under _clause (iii)(x)_ or _(iii)(y)_ :

  

##### (A) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United
States or other countries in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
conduct operations or that are the result of acts of war or terrorism;

  

##### (B) general changes or developments in any industry in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate;

  

##### (C) any loss or threatened loss of, or adverse change or threatened
adverse change in, the relationship of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with its customers, partners, employees, financing sources or suppliers, or
any change in the Companys credit ratings, caused by the pendency or the
announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

##### (D) any action or omission expressly required pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement (other than the consummation of the Merger itself), or
pursuant to the express written request of Parent;

        

##### (E) changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and any
foreign equivalents thereof (" _GAAP_ ") or any Law after the date hereof;

  

##### (F) any failure by the Company to meet any estimates of revenues or
earnings for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement in and
of itself; _provided_ that the exception in this _clause (F)_ shall not
prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any Change underlying or
contributing to such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

  

##### (G) a decline in the price or trading volume of the Company common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") in and of itself;
_provided_ that the exception in this _clause (G)_ shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any Change underlying or contributing
to such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and

  

##### (H) reductions in regulatory reimbursement rates affecting the Company
taking effect after the date hereof and the Changes resulting therefrom;

  

##### unless, in the case of the foregoing _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ _(E)_ and
_(H)_ such changes have a disproportionate effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, when compared to other companies operating in
the same industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate.

  

### (b) _Capital Structure; Indebtedness_.

  

#### (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 39,000,000
Shares, of which 23,627,935 Shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on June 30, 2007, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of
which were outstanding as of the date hereof. Since June 30, 2007, the
Company has not issued any Shares other than the issuance of Shares upon the
exercise in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans of Company Options
outstanding on such date disclosed in _Section 5.1(b)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and since June 30, 2007 the Company has not issued any
Share Equivalents. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of the
date of this Agreement, other than Shares reserved for issuance under the dj
Orthopedics, Inc. Fifth Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option Plan, dj
Orthopedics, Inc. 2001 Omnibus Plan, dj Orthopedics, Inc. 2001 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan and the dj Orthopedics, Inc. 2001 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan **** (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), the Company has no
Shares reserved for issuance. _Section 5.1(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter contains a correct and complete list as of June 30, 2007 of Company
Options outstanding under the Stock Plans, including the holder, date of
grant, term, number of Shares subject to each Company Option and exercise
price. The exercise price per Share applicable to each Company Option was, on
the applicable grant date, no less than the fair market value (as such term
is defined in the Stock Plans) of the underlying Share on such date. Other
than the Company Options, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not issued or
granted any restricted stock, performance stock units, restricted stock units
or any other equity or equity-based awards (including cash-settled awards)
under the Stock Plans or otherwise. Each of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is
duly

        

#### authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by
the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest,
claim, option to purchase or lease or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_
"). Except as set forth above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity
securities of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
payments directly or indirectly based (in whole or in part) on the price or
value of the Shares or preferred shares, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights (" _Share Equivalents_ ") are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not
have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations for
borrowed money the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries on any
matter. For purposes of this Agreement, a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company shall include any Subsidiary of the Company of which all of the
shares of capital stock of such Subsidiary other than director qualifying
shares are owned by the Company (or a wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company).

  

#### (ii) The only outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (not including intercompany amounts) is set forth in
_Section 5.1(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

### (c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Opinion of Financial Advisor_.

  

#### (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has
taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject
only to, with respect to the Merger, the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote to approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). The
Company Stockholder Approval is the only action of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to approve and adopt this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

  

#### (ii) The Company Board at a meeting duly called and held, has by
unanimous vote of the directors, (A) approved and adopted this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, which adoption has not
been rescinded or modified, (B) determined that this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby

        

#### are advisable and fair to and in the best interest of the Company and
its stockholders, (C) resolved (subject to _Section 6.2_) to recommend this
Agreement and the Merger to its stockholders for approval and adoption, and
(D) directed that this Agreement and the Merger be submitted to its
stockholders for consideration in accordance with this Agreement.
The Company Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of the Company required to adopt this Agreement
or approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
applicable Law. The Company Board has received the opinion of Wachovia
Capital Markets, LLC to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the
$50.25 per share merger consideration to be received by holders of the Shares
(other than as set forth in such opinion) is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders, subject to the qualifications set forth therein, a
complete and correct signed copy of which opinion will be delivered to
Parent, solely for informational purposes, after receipt thereof by the
Company.

  

### (d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

  

#### (i) Other than the filings and/or notices (A) pursuant to _Section 1.3_
, (B) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), (C) the foreign antitrust and merger control
laws listed on _Section 5.1(d)(i)(C)_  of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
" _Foreign Antitrust Laws_ "), (D) under the Exchange Act, (E) under the
rules of the NYSE and (F) set forth on _Section 5.1(d)(i)(F)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " _Company Approvals_ "), no notices, reports or other
filings are required to be made by the Company with, nor are any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained
by the Company from, any domestic or foreign governmental or regulatory
authority, agency, commission, body, court or other legislative, executive or
judicial governmental entity (each a " _Governmental Entity_ "), in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

#### (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien on any
of the assets of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant
to any material agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement, commitment, bond or other obligation (each, a "
_Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound or, (C) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in _Section
5.1(d)(i)_ , a violation of any Law to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of _clause (B)_ or _(C)_ above,
for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration
or change that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        

### (e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

  

#### (i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis
all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it with the Securities Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
") under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ") since December 31, 2004 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents filed or furnished
since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date
hereof, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of
the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied
or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As
of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the
date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports
filed or furnished with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading.

  

#### (ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NYSE.

  

#### (iii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the
case of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or in the case
of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations and cash flows, as
the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to the absence of information or notes not required by GAAP to be included in
interim financial statements and to normal year-end adjustments), and in each
case have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis, except as may be noted therein.

  

#### (iv) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls and financial reporting (as required
by Rule 13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act) that are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company
maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys
outside auditors and the audit

        

#### committee of the Company Board that they have identified (A) no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to materially and
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) no fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. As of December 31,
2006, the Company has concluded, following an evaluation under the
supervision and with the participation of the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures, that the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  Since the enactment of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
made any prohibited loans to any executive officer of the Company (as defined
in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

#### (v) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of
all material correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since the
Applicable Date and prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, there are
no outstanding or unresolved comments from the SEC staff with respect to
any Company Report.

  

### (f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2006 there has not
been any Change that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
December 31, 2006 through the date of this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not
engaged in any transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual
course of such businesses consistent with past practices and have not taken
any action which, if it had been taken after the date hereof, would have
required the prior written consent of Parent pursuant to _clauses (A)_ ,
_(B)_ , _(C)_ , _(E)_ , _(F)_ ,  _(G)_ , _(H)_ , _(I)_ , _(J)_ , _(K)_ ,
_(L)_ , _(M)_ ,  _(N)_ , _(R)_ and _(S)_ of _Section 6.1_ (assuming
any applicable threshold contained therein was already fully surpassed),
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has suffered any
damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) other than
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice.

  

### (g) _Litigation and Liabilities_.

  

#### (i) There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits,
claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations, inquiries or other
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets,
properties or rights, which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity
which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. This _Section 5.1(g)(i)_ does not apply to litigation and
liabilities relating to compliance with Health Care Laws, which is addressed
in _Section 5.1(s)_ hereunder.

  

#### (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), whether or not

        

#### required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto, other than liabilities
and obligations (A) set forth in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2006 included in the Company Reports, (B) incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2006, (C) incurred in connection with the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (D) that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

#### The term "Knowledge" when used in this Agreement with respect to the
Company shall mean the actual knowledge of those persons set forth in
_Section 5.1(g) _ of the Company Disclosure Letter without obligation of any
further review or inquiry, and does not include information of which they may
be deemed to have constructive knowledge only.

  

### (h) _Employee Benefits_.

  

#### (i) All material employee benefit plans covering current or former
officers, directors, employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Employees_ ") or current or former independent

there is or could be a financial obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not subject to ERISA,

complete copy (or, to the extent no such copy exists, an

disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or
subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent),
Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant to the Company that:

Merger Sub (x) is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good

jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing (with respect to

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents of
Parent and Merger Sub, each as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

by Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or
obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

#### (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws or comparable governing documents of Parent or
Merger Sub or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the

assuming

       

#### compliance with the matters referred to in _Section 5.2(c)(i)_ , any
Laws or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which Parent or

obligations of any party under any of such Contracts, except, in the case of

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (d) _Litigation_. There is no suit, claim, action, arbitration,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
is subject to or bound by any outstanding judgment, settlement, order, writ,
injunction, award or decree that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impede the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

The term "Knowledge" when used in this Agreement with respect to the Parent
shall mean the actual knowledge of those persons set forth in _Section
5.2(d)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter without obligation of any further
review or inquiry, and does not include information of which they may be
deemed to have constructive knowledge only.

  

### (e) _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company (i) true and
complete copies of the commitment letter (as the same may be amended in
accordance with _Section 6.13(a)_ ), dated as of the date hereof, between
Parent and each of Bank of America, N.A., Banc of America Securities LLC,
Banc of America Bridge LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Credit
Suisse (the " _Debt Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which the lenders
party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set forth
therein for the purposes of financing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and related fees and expenses (the " _Debt Financing_ ") and (ii)
true and complete copies of the equity commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof, between Parent and Blackstone, (the " _Equity Financing
Commitment_ " and together with the Debt Financing Commitment, the "
_Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which Blackstone has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest the amount
set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and together with the Debt
Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, none of
the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated except as permitted by _Section 6.13(a)_ and the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any material respect. Parent has fully paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Financing
Commitment that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and, as of the
date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment is in full force and
effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to
the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto so long as it remains in
effect. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in
or contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under
any of the Financing Commitments, and Parent has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy any of the conditions to the Financing

       

### contemplated by the Financing Commitments (subject to the Company
complying with its obligations hereunder and assuming that there will not be
a Company Material Adverse Effect). After giving effect to the amounts
expected to be funded under the Financing Commitments (subject to the terms
thereof), and assuming compliance by the Company with its obligations
hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub would have at the Closing funds sufficient,
together with available cash of the Company, to pay the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated
by the Financing Commitments) and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to pay all related fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by Parent
or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of
Parents obligations hereunder.

  

### (f) _Capitalization of Parent and Merger Sub_. The authorized capital
stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 100 shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will
be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date
hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets,
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its
formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger, the Financing
Commitments and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (g) _Solvency_. Assuming that the Company is solvent immediately prior to
the Effective Time and the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and
assuming (i) the accuracy and completeness of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained herein at such time (assuming, for such
purposes, such representations and warranties are true and correct at such
time without giving effect to any "Knowledge", materiality or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualifications or exceptions), and (ii) the 2007
Operating Plan provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof
prove to be accurate in all material respects, and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any
alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in the
Financing Commitments, payment of all amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person,
means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair
saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed
(A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and
other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute
and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged

       

### or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii) such Person will
be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such
Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

  

### (h) _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantor has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranty. The
Guaranty is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Guarantor, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception, and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the
Guarantor under the Guaranty.

  

### (i) _Information Supplied_.  None of the information supplied or to be
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any event or circumstance relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered
by Parent which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, Parent shall notify the
Company in writing. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with
the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation
or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information
or statements with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries made
or incorporated by reference therein supplied by or on behalf of the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood and agreed that such confidentiality agreement
need not prohibit the making or amendment of any Takeover Proposal). From the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (it being understood such efforts
do not include an obligation to commence litigation) to enforce the employee
non-solicit/no-hire provisions of any confidentiality agreement entered into
with any Person whether prior to, on or after the date of this Agreement and
the provision thereof requiring the other party thereto to keep confidential
any proprietary, confidential information about the Company obtained by such
Person pursuant to such confidentiality agreement (it being understood that
the Company may provide any consent and grant any approval contemplated by
any such confidentiality agreement).

  

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.2_ and except as may relate to
any Excluded Party, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors and officers shall, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the other Company Representatives, to (i) on the No-Shop
Period Start Date, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal; and (ii)
from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , not
(A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing non-public information other than in the ordinary course of
business) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Takeover
Proposal or (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding a Takeover Proposal. No later than two
business days after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify
Parent in writing of the number of Excluded Parties and the Company shall
provide to Parent (within such two business day time frame) a written summary
of the material terms of any Takeover Proposal from an Excluded Party (it
being understood that such material terms do not have to include the identity
of the Excluded Party).

        

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.2(b)_
but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.2(c)_ , if, at any time
on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of the Company Representatives
receives a bona fide written Takeover Proposal by any Person or group of
Persons, which Takeover Proposal was made on or after the No-Shop Period
Start Date and which did not arise from or in connection with a breach of
this _Section 6.2_ , (i) the Company and the Company Representatives may
contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith (A) after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, the Company and Company Representatives may (x)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover
Proposal (provided that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent
and Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries that is made available to any Person given such access which
was not previously made available to Parent and Merger Sub), and (y) engage
in or otherwise participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such
Takeover Proposal. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
shall promptly advise Parent of the receipt by the Company of any Takeover
Proposal made on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date or any request for
non-public information made by any Person or group of Persons that has
informed the Company it is considering making a Takeover Proposal or any
request for discussions or negotiations with the Company or the Company
Representatives relating to a Takeover Proposal (in each case within 48 hours
of receipt thereof), and the Company shall provide to Parent (within such 48
hour time frame) the number of Persons or group of Persons making
such Takeover Proposals and a written summary of the material terms of such
Takeover Proposal (it being understood that such material terms shall not
include the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Takeover
Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will also promptly
notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions regarding a Takeover Proposal.
Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall keep Parent
informed on a prompt basis of any material change to the terms and conditions
of any Takeover Proposal (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any
amendment or modification to any Takeover Proposal made by an Excluded
Party). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof
which prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that, notwithstanding the
commencement of the obligations of the Company under _Section 6.2(b)_  on the
No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the
activities described in _clause (i)_ and/or _(ii)_ of _Section 6.2(a)_ with
respect to any Excluded Parties on and after the No-Shop Period Start Date,
including with respect to any amended or revised proposal submitted by such
Excluded Parties on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, and this _Section
6.2(c)_ shall not apply with respect thereto; _provided_  that to the extent
set forth therein, the provisions of _Section 6.2(g)_  shall apply.

        

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person,
group of Persons or group that includes any Person (so long as such Person
and the other members of such group, if any, who were members of such group
immediately prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date constitute at least 50% of
the equity financing of such group at all times following the No-Shop Period
Start Date and prior to the termination of this Agreement) from whom the
Company or any of the Company Representatives has received a written Takeover
Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop
Period Start Date that the Company Board determines in good faith is bona
fide and constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded
Party for all purposes under this Agreement at such time as the Takeover
Proposal (as such Takeover Proposal may be revised during the course of
ongoing negotiations, in which event it may temporarily cease to be a
Superior Proposal or a Takeover Proposal that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, so long as such negotiations are ongoing and,
the Company Board in good faith determines that, it subsequently constitutes
a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal) made by such Person fails to constitute either a Superior Proposal
or, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, a Takeover Proposal that
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
proposal or offer, on its most recently amended and modified terms, from any
Person or group of Persons (other than Parent and its affiliates) relating to
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of the
consolidated assets (including equity securities of the Subsidiaries of the
Company) or consolidated revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 15%
or more of the Shares then outstanding, any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or
more of the Shares then outstanding, and any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company that if consummated would result in holders
of Shares immediately prior to such transaction owning less than 85% of the
outstanding voting power of the Company or the resulting parent entity of the
Company immediately following such transaction, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior
Proposal_ " means a bona fide Takeover Proposal made in writing and not
solicited in violation of _Section 6.2(b)_ , on its most recently amended and
modified terms (with all percentages in the definition of Takeover Proposal
changed to 50%), that is on terms that the Company Board determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) would, if
consummated, be more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby (x) after taking into
account the likelihood and timing of consummation (as compared to the
transactions contemplated hereby) and (y) after taking into account all
material legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such Takeover
Proposal), regulatory or other aspects of such Takeover Proposal.

  

(f) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.2_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation (as defined in _Section 6.4_ below); (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal (any of the actions referred to in the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , whether taken by the Company Board or a
committee thereof, an " _Adverse Recommendation_

        

 _Change_ "); or (iii) cause or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or any similar
agreement or understanding (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to a Takeover Proposal.

  

(g) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if (1) the Company
has received a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that has not been
withdrawn or abandoned and that the Company Board concludes in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments
which may be offered by Parent pursuant to _clause (B)_ below or (2) in the
absence of a Takeover Proposal, if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so
(for reasons other than those relating to the then-current operating or
financial performance of the Company, unless such operating or financial
performance has been materially impacted by an event or result outside the
ordinary course of the Companys business and not contemplated by the
financial projections provided by the Company to Parent) would be a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may (x) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) in the case of _clause (1)_ above
only, terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
Board may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the
foregoing _clause (x)_ and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing _clause (y)_ unless:

  

##### (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and
Merger Sub, at least five calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "),
of its intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
such Superior Proposal and/or to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, or otherwise
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in the circumstance referred to above,
which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal (it being understood that such material terms and
conditions do not have to include the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making the Superior Proposal) or the reasons for such Adverse
Recommendation Change in the absence of a Takeover Proposal, and
contemporaneously with providing such notice, as applicable, shall have
provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the
party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents ( _provided_
 that such copies of such agreements and other material documents, may
exclude the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior
Proposal); and

  

##### (B) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to a Superior Proposal or otherwise in the circumstance referred to above
and/or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
legal and financial advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub
desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal or such Adverse Recommendation Change is no longer required.

        

##### In the event that during the Notice Period any revisions are made to
the Superior Proposal to which the proviso in this _Section 6.2(g)(i)_
applies and the Company Board in its good faith judgment determines such
revisions are material (it being agreed that any change in the purchase price
in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub
and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.2(g)(i)_ with respect
to such new written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to
two business days.

  

#### (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall
not be entitled to enter into any agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to a Superior Proposal unless this
Agreement is concurrently terminated by its terms pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)_ and the Company has paid concurrently to Parent the Termination Fee
payable pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_. With respect to Persons with whom
discussions or negotiations have been terminated, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to require such Persons to promptly return or destroy
in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement any
confidential information furnished by the Company. No Adverse Recommendation
Change shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing
any state takeover statute or other state Law to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the restrictions on
the Companys ability to make an Adverse Recommendation Change as set forth
in _Section 6.2(g)(i)_ , nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board,
after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law or is
otherwise required under applicable Law; provided, however, that neither the
Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted
to recommend that the Company stockholders tender any securities in
connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse
or recommend any Takeover Proposal), unless in each case, in connection
therewith, the Company Board effects an Adverse Recommendation Change;
_provided_ _further_  that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and
listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the
Company Recommendation at least two business days prior to the Stockholders
Meeting if Parent has delivered to the Company a written request to so
reaffirm at least 48 hours (or if 48 hours is impracticable, as far in
advance as is practicable) prior to the time such reaffirmation is to be
made.

  

## 6.3 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form with the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Company will provide to
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Proxy Statement, or any amendments or supplements thereto, prior to filing
the same with the SEC. The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that at the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting (as defined in _Section 6.4_ below), (a) the
Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
(b) none of the information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

        

## state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall as soon as
reasonably practicable notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall as
soon as reasonably practicable provide to Parent copies of all material
correspondence between the Company and/or any of its representatives on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly after the date the SEC staff
advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company
may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Laws, the
Company and Parent (with respect to itself and Merger Sub) each shall, upon
request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by
or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

## 6.4 _Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company, acting through its board of
directors, shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, all reasonable action necessary to convene a
meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_") as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement to consider and
vote upon the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Except
in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change permitted by
_Section 6.2(g)_ , (a) the Proxy Statement shall include a recommendation by
the Company, through the Company Board, to the holders of Shares that the
Company Stockholder Approval be given (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and
(b) the Company Board shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit the
Company Stockholder Approval. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with its terms pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ , the Company shall
submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the Stockholders Meeting even
if the Company Board shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its
recommendation thereof or otherwise effected an Adverse Recommendation Change
or proposed or announced any intention to do so.

  

## 6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

  

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use

contemplated hereby and Parent and the Company shall pay all filing and
similar fees and related expenses payable in connection therewith. The
Company and Parent shall ensure their respective filings under the HSR Act
are made within twenty business days after the date of this Agreement. The
Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period

relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other
in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company,

Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other

shall permit any of its officers or any other representatives to participate
in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry in each case relating solely to the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate therein

Agreement, without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
this _Section 6.5_ , Parent and the Company agree to take or cause to be
taken the following actions:

the entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would restrain,

Parent of its willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate

holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or businesses or other
segments of the Company after the occurrence of the Effective Time and/or
Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company,

agreements with, and submission to orders of, the Antitrust Division of the
U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and the German

thereto), if such action should be necessary to avoid, prevent, eliminate or
remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (A) commencement of any
administrative, judicial or other proceeding in any forum by any Government
Antitrust Entity or (B) issuance of any order, decree, decision,
determination or judgment that would restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the Merger by any Government Antitrust Entity; and

  

#### (ii) the prompt use of their respective reasonable best efforts, in the
event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision,
order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes
reasonably foreseeable or threatened to be entered or issued, in any
proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to resist,
vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such
actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree so as to permit such consummation on the schedule

#### Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in clauses (i) and (ii) above
shall require Parent to take any action which (A) is reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, assets, liabilities or results of operations of either Parent (or
any of its Subsidiaries) or the Company, taken individually or in the
aggregate, or (B) is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

## 6.6 _Access_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers
and other authorized representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to

that the foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure, unless such information is
necessary to prepare for or address any formal or informal request for
information from any Government Antitrust Entity or (b) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall
be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the

## significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
such employees of their normal duties. All requests for information made
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall be directed to the individual or other

thereto to honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys and its Subsidiaries
obligations under the agreements identified in _Section 6.9(c)_ of

also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the Side A
coverage part (directors and officers liability) of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies as well as the Companys existing
separate Side A policy for its directors and officers, and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as
the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, there shall
be no breach of this provision so long as the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, to the Companys directors and officers as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-
year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable to the Companys directors and officers as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_  that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_
_further_  that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.11_  shall
be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

        

## 6.12 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on such transactions.

  

## 6.13 _Financing_.

  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as
practicable on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment ( _provided_  that Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the
Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt
Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as such
replacement or amendment would not adversely impact or delay in any material
respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or the likelihood of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Debt Financing Commitment, subject to the foregoing replacement
and amendment rights, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment that are within their control (including by
consummating the financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing
Commitment and by assisting in the syndication or marketing of the financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment) and (iii) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Financing Commitment or on other terms reasonably
acceptable to Parent that would not adversely impact in any material respect
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_ , _Sections 7.2(a)_ and _7.2(b)_ and the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.3_ , at the Closing Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders under the Debt Financing to fund
the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby if the conditions to the Debt Financing Commitment are then satisfied.
Without limiting Parents obligations under this _Section 6.13_ , if any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms not materially less beneficial to Parent and
Merger Sub in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but in no event later than the Termination Date.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any
party to the Financing Commitments of which Parent or Merger Sub
becomes aware, or any termination of the Financing Commitments. Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide copies of all documents
related to the Debt Financing (other than any ancillary documents subject to
confidentiality agreements) to the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
compliance by Parent with this _Section 6.13(a)_ shall not relieve Parent of
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not the Debt Financing is available.

        

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the respective officers, employees and advisors, including
legal and accounting, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to
Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
reasonably necessary or customary in connection with the Financing (
_provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including (i) participating in a reasonable or customary number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating
agencies, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents necessary or customary in connection with the Financing,
(iii) using commercially reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent and Merger
Sub as promptly as reasonably practicable with financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing, including
information customarily included in private placement memoranda relating to
private placements under Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act to
consummate the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt
Financings Commitments at the time during the Companys fiscal year such
offering(s) will be made as soon as such financial and other information
becomes available, including all financial statements and financial data of
the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act (other than Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, but including pro forma
financial information and summary guarantor/non-guarantor financial
information of the type customarily included in offering documents used in
private placements under Rule 144A, and summary quarterly financial
information and without giving effect to the executive compensation and
related person disclosure rules related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A;
34-54302A; IC-27444A), including audits thereof to the extent so required
(which audits shall be unqualified) (all such information in this
_clause (iii)_ , the " _Required Information_ "), (iv) cooperating with and
using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in procuring accountants
comfort letters and consents, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance and
other customary documentation required by the Debt Financing Commitments, in
each case as reasonably requested by Parent and, if reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub, (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to provide
monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) within the time frame, and
to the extent, the Company prepares such financial statements in the ordinary
course of business, (vi) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in
procuring the execution and delivery, as of the Effective Time, by the
officers of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries of any customary
pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters) and
otherwise reasonably facilitating, to the extent reasonably requested by
Parent, the pledging of collateral (including cooperation, to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, in connection with the pay-off of existing
indebtedness and the release of related Liens), (vii) taking all actions to
the extent reasonably requested by Parent necessary to (A) permit the
prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Companys
current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing collateral
arrangements and (B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing, and
(viii) taking all corporate actions, subject to

        

the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the consummation of the Debt Financing immediately following the
Effective Time; _provided_ that none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other cost or expense that is not simultaneously reimbursed by
Parent in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time. In
the event that prior to February 15, 2008 (x) all or any portion of the Debt
Financing structured as high yield financing has not been consummated, (y)
all closing conditions contained in _ARTICLE VII_ shall have been satisfied
or waived (other than the delivery of the officer certificates to be

bridge financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement) are available in
all material respects on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letters (or described in replacements thereof on terms and

financing therefor), then Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the lenders under such bridge facility to fund proceeds of such bridge
financing (or replacement or alternative financing) to be used to replace
such privately offered note financing no later than the final day of the
Marketing Period. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable documented out of pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, expenses, interest, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided by the Company or the Subsidiaries in
accordance with the terms hereof). The Company hereby consents to the use of
its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

consolidated financial statements for the applicable periods by Ernst and Young
LLP or another independent registered accounting firm reasonably acceptable
to Parent, (B) the Company shall have announced any intention to restate any

the financial statements included in the Required Information that is

period or (ii) the Companys independent registered accounting firm to issue
a customary comfort letter to purchasers (in accordance with its normal

(including any exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter and the

agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with

FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY

REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  

## 9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 6.11_
 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent and
the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties
and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other
party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including,
the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein.
The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries
under _Section 6.11_ shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time

of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with

        

## _Section 9.3_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

## 9.9 _Obligations of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take

after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action.

  

## 9.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  

## 9.11 _Interpretation_.

  

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference
shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise

provision of this Agreement.

  

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

        

## 9.12 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in
its sole and absolute discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to Parent or to any, direct or indirect, wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
