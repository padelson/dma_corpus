as practicable (and in any event within 30 days) make a final determination of the Earnout Amount, which shall be binding on the parties. Each of Acquirer and the Representative shall provide the Firm with all information and documentation that the
Firm requests. The Company Stockholders shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses of the Firm which amount may be deducted from and paid by Acquirer to the Firm from the Earnout Amount, if any; provided, however, that if the Firm
