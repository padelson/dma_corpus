ARTICLE 2

 

THE MERGER



2.1 _The Merger_. __



2.1.1 _Reverse Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the
_"Reverse Merger"_ ), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. Subject
to Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, the Company as the surviving corporation after
the Merger is referred herein as the _"Surviving Corporation_. _"_



2.1.2 _Two-Step Merger_. In addition to Merger Sub being merged with and into
the Company as provided in Section 2.1.1, then as soon as reasonably
practicable following the consummation of the Reverse Merger but in any event
within sixty (60) days thereafter, the Company shall be merged (the _"Second-
Step Forward Merger"_ ) with and into another direct wholly owned subsidiary
of Acquirer (the _"Second-Step Sub"_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Second-Step Forward Merger shall not be required if Acquirer and
Representative determine in good faith in writing after consultation with
their respective counsel that such Second-Step Forward Merger is not necessary
in order to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"  



 

8  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Second-Step
Forward Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease
and Second-Step Sub shall continue as the Surviving Corporation. __



2.1.3 _Definition of Merger_. The Reverse Merger is referred to herein as the
_"Merger_. _"_ __



2.2 _Conversion of Shares_.



 

2.2.1 _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
share of Merger Sub Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of
the Company and the shares of the Company into which the shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock are so converted shall be the only shares of Company Stock
that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.



2.2.2 _Conversion of Company Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of Company Common
Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including all shares of Company Preferred Stock which shall have been
converted into Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time as
contemplated by Section 9.15) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the
need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof (except as
expressly provided herein), be converted into and represent the right to
receive (a) the number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock that is equal to
the Common Conversion Number and (b) the Cash Amount (collectively, the "
_Closing Consideration Per Share_ "). The preceding provisions of this Section
2.2.2 are subject to the provisions of Section 2.2.3 (regarding rights of
holders of Dissenting Shares), Section 2.2.4 (regarding cancellation of
Company-owned stock), Section 2.2.5 (regarding the elimination of fractional
shares of Acquirer Common Stock), Section 2.2.6 (regarding the continuation of
vesting and repurchase rights), Section 2.3 (regarding adjustments for
Capital Changes) and Section 2.5 (regarding the withholding of the Escrow
Fund).



2.2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. As more fully set forth in Section 7.3, holders of
shares of Company Stock who have complied with all requirements
for perfecting stockholders appraisal rights, as set forth in Section 262 of
the Delaware Law, and to the extent applicable to the Company, with all
requirements for perfecting stockholders dissenters rights as set forth in
Section 1300 et. seq. under the California Law, shall be entitled to their
rights under the Delaware Law and, if applicable, the California Law, with
respect to such shares.



2.2.4 _Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock_. Notwithstanding Section 2.2.2,
each share of Company Stock held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.



2.2.5 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Acquirer Common Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of
Company Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Acquirer Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2.2, computed after aggregating
all shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be  



 

9  received by such holder pursuant to Section 2.2.2, shall instead receive
from Acquirer, upon surrender of such holders Company Certificates pursuant
to Article 7, an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (a) the Acquirer Average Price Per Share by
(b) the fraction of a share of Acquirer Common Stock that such holder would
otherwise have been entitled to receive.



2.2.6 _Continuation of Vesting and Repurchase Rights_. If any shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested
or subject to a repurchase option, vesting schedule or any other condition or
rights of the Company providing that such shares may be forfeited to or
repurchased by the Company upon any termination of the relevant relationship
(including employment or directorship) of the Company with the holder (or
prior holder thereof) under the terms of any restricted stock
purchase agreement, stock option agreement (including any stock option
agreement under the Company Plan) or other agreement with the Company (such
shares being referred to herein as _"Unvested Company Shares"_ ), then such
repurchase option, vesting schedule, other condition or other rights shall be
assigned to Acquirer, the shares of Acquirer Common Stock issued upon the
conversion of such Unvested Company Shares in the Merger, together with the
Cash Amount payable with respect to each such Unvested Company Share pursuant
to Section 2.2.2, shall continue to be unvested and shall continue to be
subject to the same repurchase options, vesting schedules, other conditions or
rights, as applicable, immediately following the Effective Time as they were
subject to immediately prior to the Effective Time. The certificates
representing such shares of Acquirer Common Stock shall accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends noting such repurchase options, vesting schedules or
other conditions. The Cash Amount payable with respect to each such Unvested
Company Share shall be withheld by Acquirer at the Closing and shall instead
become payable to the holder of such Unvested Company Share at the end of the
fiscal quarter of Acquirer in which the unvested share(s) of Acquirer Common
Stock into which such Unvested Company Share has been converted hereunder,
become vested in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant
Company agreement assigned to Acquirer hereunder with respect to such
Unvested Share (or upon the date of termination of employment of such holder
with the Company, if such event occurs earlier). The Company shall take all
actions that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Acquirer (or its assignee) is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option, vesting schedule or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement, vesting schedule or other agreement.



2.3 _Adjustments for Capital Changes_. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Article 2, if Acquirer recapitalizes, either through a subdivision (or stock
split) of any of the outstanding shares of Acquirer Common Stock into a
greater number of such shares, or a combination (or reverse stock split) of
any of the outstanding shares of Acquirer Common Stock into a lesser number
of such shares, or reorganizes, reclassifies or otherwise changes its
outstanding shares of Acquirer Common Stock into the same or a different
number of shares of other classes or series of Acquirer stock (other than
through a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in the preceding
clause), or declares a dividend or other distribution on the outstanding
shares of Acquirer Common Stock payable in shares of Acquirer Common Stock,
in shares or securities convertible into shares of Acquirer Common Stock
and/or other Acquirer equity securities and/or cash, securities, notes or
other consideration in any form, or is a party to a merger or consolidation
with or into another corporation in which Acquirer is not the surviving
entity (or is a party to a reverse triangular merger is which Acquirer is the
surviving entity) and  



 

10  the shares of Acquirers capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the
merger or consolidation are converted into such other
corporations securities, cash or other property (each, a _"Capital Change"_
), at any time after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, then
the Common Conversion Number shall be equitably adjusted.



2.4 _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, all outstanding options
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, _"Company Options"_
), including all Company Options granted under the Companys 2001 Stock Plan
(the _"Company Plan"_ ), shall be assumed by Acquirer and the Companys
repurchase right with respect to any unvested shares of Company Common Stock
acquired upon the exercise of Company Options shall be assigned to Acquirer.
Each Company Option so assumed by Acquirer shall be entitled, in accordance
with the terms of such option, to purchase after the Effective Time that
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock determined by multiplying (a) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option at
the Effective Time by (b) the Common Conversion Number. After the Effective
Time, the exercise price per share for each such assumed Company Option shall
equal the exercise price per share of the Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by the Common Conversion Number. If the foregoing
calculations result in an assumed Company Option being exercisable for a
fraction of a share or a fraction of a cent, then the number of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock subject to such option shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number and the exercise price of such option shall be rounded up
to the nearest cent. In addition, upon due exercise of each Company Option so
assumed by Acquirer in accordance with its terms, the holder thereof shall
become entitled to receive with respect to each share of Acquirer Common Stock
issued to such holder upon such exercise an amount in cash equal to the Cash
Amount divided by the Common Conversion Number (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), which amount shall be paid by Acquirer in one lump sum to such
holder at the end of the fiscal quarter of Acquirer during which such option
exercise occurred (or upon the date of termination of employment of such
holder with the Company, if such event occurs earlier). No Company Options
shall become vested or exercisable solely as a result of the Merger. To the
extent permitted by Applicable Law and otherwise consistent with the terms of
this Agreement, the term, exercisability, vesting schedule, status as an
"incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if applicable, and all
other terms of the assumed Company Options as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall otherwise be unchanged. 



As soon as practicable (but in no event later than ten days) after the
Effective Time, Acquirer shall deliver to the holders of Company Options
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the Company
Plan and that the agreements evidencing such options shall continue in effect
on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 2.4 after giving effect to the Merger). At or before the Effective
Time, Acquirer shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of Company Options assumed in accordance with this Section 2.4.
As soon as practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) days) after the
Effective Time, Acquirer shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of
Acquirer Common Stock issuable pursuant to any Company Options assumed by
Acquirer pursuant to Section 2.4 and shall maintain the effectiveness, to the
extent permitted by the SEC Rules and Regulations, of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such
options remain outstanding.



 

11 2.5 _Escrow_. At the Effective Time, Acquirer shall withhold from the shares
of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued, and the cash consideration to be paid,
to the Company Stockholders in the Merger upon conversion of their Company
Stock pursuant to Section 2.2.2, each Company Stockholders Pro Rata Share of
that number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock and that portion of the cash
consideration (the withholding of such Acquirer Common Stock and cash being
pro rata to the respective proportions that each of the Share Consideration
and the Cash Consideration bear to the Closing Consideration) having an
aggregate value (based on the Acquirer Average Price Per Share with respect to
the share portion thereof) equal to 10.0% of the Closing Consideration (such
withheld shares of Acquirer Common Stock, the _"Escrow Shares"_ and such
withheld cash consideration, the " _Escrow Cash_ ") to secure the performance
of the indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Article 11. If a Company Stockholder holds Unvested Company Shares, then the
proportion of shares of Acquirer Common Stock issued upon conversion hereunder
of shares of Company Stock held by such Company Stockholder that are not
Unvested Company Shares ( _"Vested Company Shares"_ ), and the proportion of
the Cash Consideration payable with respect to such Vested Shares, that shall
be withheld from such Company Stockholder and placed in escrow shall be the
proportion that (a) the aggregate number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock
which such Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive for its
Vested Company Shares bears to (b) all shares of Acquirer Common Stock which
such Company Stockholder is entitled to receive at the Effective Time.
Similarly, the proportion of shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued, and
the proportion of the Cash Consideration payable, to such Company Stockholder
upon conversion hereunder of Unvested Company Shares, that shall be withheld
from such Company Stockholder and placed in escrow shall be the proportion
that (a) the aggregate number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock which such
Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive for its Unvested
Company Shares bears to (b) all shares of Acquirer Common Stock which such
Company Stockholder is entitled to receive at the Effective Time. With respect
to each Company Stockholder that holds Unvested Company Shares, such holders
payment of any Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash in satisfaction of any
indemnification obligations under Article 11 shall be made ratably among the
Company Stockholders Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash that were issued upon
conversion of Vested Company Shares and the Company Stockholders Escrow
Shares and Escrow Cash that were issued upon conversion of Unvested Company
Shares and that such Company Stockholder contributed to the Escrow Fund. Any
shares of Acquirer Common Stock or other equity securities issued or
distributed by Acquirer (including shares issued upon a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization or other similar event) in respect of Escrow Shares
shall also be withheld in the Escrow Fund. Cash dividends on the Escrow Shares
shall not be added to the escrow fund but shall be distributed to the record
holders of the Escrow Shares. Acquirer shall hold the Escrow Fund as security
for the Company Stockholders indemnification obligations for Damages under
Article 11. Unless and until the Escrow Shares contributed by a Company
Stockholder to the Escrow Fund shall have been released in accordance with
Article 11 hereof to compensate Acquirer Indemnified Parties for Damages, each
Company Stockholder shall continue to be entitled to all rights to vote such
Escrow Shares in accordance with Delaware Law. For federal income tax
purposes, the Escrow Cash shall be treated as the property of Acquirer until
released to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Article 11.



 

12 2.6 _Earnout_.



2.6.1 _Computation of Earnout_. As promptly as practicable after January 31,
2005, but not later than March 15, 2005, Acquirer shall deliver to the
Representative a written report setting forth Acquirers computation of the
Earnout Amount, together with the data supporting such calculation. In the
event that the Representative shall dispute the Earnout Amount as calculated
by Acquirer, the Representative shall notify Acquirer in writing (the
_"Earnout_ _Dispute Notice"_ ), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
of the dispute, within 30 days of receiving such calculation. If the
Representative does not provide Acquirer with an Earnout Dispute Notice within
such 30-day period, the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted such
calculation as correct and final. In the event that the Representative
provides Acquirer with an Earnout Dispute Notice, then the Representative and
Acquirer shall confer in good faith for a period of up to 30 days following
the delivery of any Earnout Dispute Notice concerning the subject matter of
the Earnout Dispute Notice in an attempt to resolve it. If a final resolution
of such dispute is reached, the agreed upon amount shall be deemed final and
binding. If, after such 30-day period, the Representative and Acquirer cannot
resolve such dispute, then Acquirer and the Representative shall mutually
agree upon a nationally recognized accounting firm to resolve such dispute, or
if they cannot agree on such a firm within five (5) days, they shall each
designate a nationally recognized accounting firm, and the two firms shall
agree upon a third nationally recognized accounting firm which third firm
shall have the sole authority to resolve such dispute. The firm so agreed upon
(the _"Firm"_ ) shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 30
days) make a final determination of the Earnout Amount, which shall be binding
on the parties. Each of Acquirer and the Representative shall provide the Firm
with all information and documentation that the Firm requests. The Company
Stockholders shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses of
the Firm which amount may be deducted from and paid by Acquirer to the Firm
from the Earnout Amount, if any; provided, however, that if the Firm in its
final determination of the Earnout Amount disagrees with Acquirers
calculation of the Earnout Amount, then Acquirer shall pay all fees and
expenses of the Firm. In the event of any unresolved dispute with respect to
calculation of the Earnout Amount, Acquirer will be under no obligation to
make any payment of the Earnout Amount until such dispute is resolved as
provided herein. The provisions of Section 11.4 shall apply to any and all
acts by the Representative in connection with this Section 2.6.



2.6.2 _Payment of Earnout to Company Stockholders_. At such time as the
Earnout Amount has been finally determined pursuant to Section 2.6.1 above
(the _"Earnout Determination Date"_ ), each Company Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock issued to such Company Stockholder at the Effective Time
(including such Company Stockholders Escrow Shares) with respect to Vested
Company Shares held by such Company Stockholder at the Effective Time
multiplied by (B) the quotient of the Earnout Consideration Per Share, if any,
divided by the Common Conversion Number (rounded to the nearest whole cent).
In the event that the Representative does not provide Acquirer with
any Earnout Dispute Notice as provided in Section 2.6.1, Acquirer will make,
or cause to be made, payment of that portion of the Earnout Amount payable to
the Company Stockholders under this Section 2.6.2 on or prior to April 1,
2005. In the event that the Representative does provide Acquirer with an
Earnout Dispute Notice as provided in Section 2.6.1, promptly and in any event
within ten (10) business days following the earliest of (i) the date of the
mutually agreed resolution of the dispute in the Dispute Earnout  



 

13  Notice, or (ii) receipt of written notice of the Firms final determination
of the Earnout Amount, Acquirer will make, or cause to be made, payment
of that portion of the Earnout Amount payable to the Company Stockholders
under this Section 2.6.2. Such payment shall be made to the record holders of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time.



2.6.3 _Effect on Stock Options_. For each assumed Company Option which has
not as of the Earnout Determination Date been exercised, Acquirer shall,
within ten (10) business days of the Earnout Determination Date, notify the
holder of such assumed Company Option of the portion of the Earnout Amount, if
any, payable to such holder with respect to each share of Acquirer Common
Stock issuable to such holder upon exercise of such assumed Company Option,
which amount shall equal the Earnout Consideration Per Share divided by the
Common Conversion Number (rounded to the nearest whole cent) and shall only
become payable to such holder in cash at such time as each such share of
Acquirer Common Stock is issued to such holder upon exercise of such assumed
Company Option in accordance with its terms, which amount shall be paid by
Acquirer in one lump sum to such holder at the end of the fiscal quarter of
Acquirer during which such option exercise occurred (or upon the date of
termination of employment of such holder with the Company, if such event
occurs earlier). For each holder of an assumed Company Option that was
exercised between the Effective Time and the Earnout Determination Date,
Acquirer shall pay to such holder, simultaneously with payment of the Earnout
Consideration Per Share, if any, to the Company Stockholders, an amount in
cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock issued to such
holder upon exercise of such assumed Company Option multiplied by (B) the
quotient of the Earnout Consideration Per Share, if any, divided by the
Common Conversion Number (rounded to the nearest whole cent).



2.6.4 _Unvested Company Shares_. With respect to that portion of the Earnout
Amount, if any, that may become payable with respect to Unvested Company
Shares held by a Company Stockholder as of the Effective Time, (i) for each
share of Acquirer Common Stock issued to such Company Stockholder with respect
to such Unvested Company Shares that have become vested as provided in Section
2.2.6 during the period from the Effective Time until the
Earnout Determination Date, simultaneously with payment of the amount, if
any, payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.6.2, Acquirer
shall pay to such Company Stockholder an amount in cash equal to (A) such
number of vested shares of Acquirer Common Stock multiplied by (B) the
quotient of the Earnout Consideration Per Share, if any, divided by the Common
Conversion Number (rounded to the nearest whole cent), and (ii) for each share
of Acquirer Common Stock issued to such Company Stockholder with respect to
such Unvested Company Shares that becomes vested as provided in Section 2.2.6
after the Earnout Determination Date, Acquirer shall pay to such Company
Stockholder, at the end of the fiscal quarter of Acquirer in which such
vesting occurred (or upon the date of termination of employment of such holder
with the Company, if such event occurs earlier), an amount in cash equal to
the quotient of the Earnout Consideration Per Share, if any, divided by the
Common Conversion Number (rounded to the nearest whole cent).



 

14 2.7 _Effects of the Merger_. At and upon the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of the Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time:

Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time until thereafter

become the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified; and

2.8 _Securities Law Issues_.



2.8.1 Pursuant to Section 6.8, the parties hereto intend that the shares
of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be
issued pursuant to a permit qualifying such securities pursuant to Section
25121 of California Securities Law such that the issuance of the shares of
Acquirer Common Stock shall be exempt pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the
Securities Act from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act (the _"Permit"_ ).



2.8.2 The shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Merger may, under certain circumstances pursuant to Section 6.8.5, be issued
pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4. If the shares of Acquirer
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger are issued pursuant to Section 6.8.5,
then Acquirer shall prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or
similar successor form) and the prospectus contained therein with the SEC in
connection with the distribution of Acquirer Common Stock in the Merger.
Acquirer will respond to any comments from the SEC, will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-4 Registration Statement
to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable

is necessary to consummate the Merger.



2.9 _Tax Matters_. The parties acknowledge their respective desire to
structure the Merger to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that such tax treatment
shall not be a condition to either partys obligation to close the
transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing
statement shall

otherwise modify the terms of this Agreement to achieve such tax treatment.
Neither Acquirer nor Company shall take any action that would, or fail to take
any action the omission of which would, be reasonably likely to prevent or
impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a)
of the United States Income Tax Regulations. Acquirer makes no representations
or warranties to the Company or to any Company Stockholder or other holder of
Company securities regarding the tax treatment of the Merger, whether the
Merger shall qualify as a tax-free plan of reorganization under the Code, or
any of the tax consequences to any Company Stockholder or other holder of
Company securities of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions or agreements contemplated hereby, and the Company and the
Company Stockholders acknowledge that the Company and the Company Stockholders
are relying solely on their own tax advisors in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Acquirer believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate
the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or

Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall execute and
deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and assurances and do
all other things necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry
out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

instrument, permit, mortgage, lease, license, understanding, letter of intent
or memorandum of understanding (whether written or oral), to which the Company
or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company, any Subsidiary, or any
of their respective material assets or properties are bound. Neither the
Companys entering into this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements nor
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby shall give rise to, or trigger the application of, any material
rights of any third party that would come into effect upon the consummation of
the Merger. The consummation of the Merger by the Company does not require
the consent, release, waiver or approval of any third party (including the
consent of any party required to be obtained in order to keep any material
agreement between such party and the Company or any Subsidiary in effect
following the Merger or to provide that the Company or any Subsidiary is not
in material breach or material violation of any such agreement following the
Merger), other than the Company Stockholder Approval.



3.6 _Litigation_. There is no action, suit, arbitration,
mediation, proceeding or claim pending against the Company or any Subsidiary
(or against any officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any
Subsidiary in their capacity as such or relating to their employment, services
or relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary) before any court,
Governmental Authority, arbitrator or mediator. To the Companys knowledge, no
action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation has
been threatened, and there is no investigation by any Governmental Authority
pending, against the Company or any Subsidiary (or against any officer,
director, employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary in their capacity
as such or relating to their employment, services or relationship with the
Company or any Subsidiary) before any court, Governmental Authority,
arbitrator or mediator. There is no judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or
order of any court, Governmental Authority or arbitrator outstanding against
the Company or any Subsidiary. To the Companys knowledge, there is no
reasonable basis for any person to assert a claim against the Company or any
Subsidiary based upon the Companys entering into this Agreement or any
Company Ancillary Agreement or consummating the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Company Ancillary
Agreement.



3.7 _Taxes_.



3.7.1 The Company and each of the Subsidiaries (a) has properly completed and
timely filed all material foreign, federal, state, local and municipal
tax and information returns (the " _Returns_ ") required to be filed by it,
(b) has timely paid all material taxes required to be paid by it for which
payment was due, (c) has established an adequate accrual or reserve in
accordance with GAAP for the payment of all taxes payable in respect of the
periods or portions  



 

20  thereof prior to the Balance Sheet Date (which accrual or reserve as of the
Balance Sheet Date is fully reflected on the Company Balance Sheet), (d) has
made (or will make on a timely basis) all estimated tax payments required to
be made, and (e) has no Liability for taxes in excess of the amount so paid or
accruals or reserves so established except for taxes subsequent to the Balance
Sheet Date incurred in the ordinary course of business. All such Returns and
reports are true, correct and complete in all material respects, and the
Company has provided Acquirer with true and correct copies of such Returns and
reports. The Company and each Subsidiary are not delinquent in the payment of
any material tax or in the filing of any Returns, and no deficiencies for any
material tax have been threatened, claimed, proposed or assessed in writing
or, to the Companys knowledge, in any other manner, against the Company or
any Subsidiary or any of the officers, employees or agents of the Company or
any Subsidiary in their capacity as such. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received any written or, to the Companys knowledge, any other
form of, notification from the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
authority regarding any material issues that: (a) are currently pending before
the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority (including any
sales or use taxing authority) regarding the Company or any Subsidiary; or
(b) have been raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority
and not yet finally resolved. No Return of the Company or any Subsidiary is
under audit by the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing
agency or authority and any such past audits (if any) have been completed and
fully resolved to the satisfaction of the applicable taxing authority
conducting such audit and all taxes determined by such audit to be due from
the Company or such Subsidiary have been paid in full to the applicable taxing
authorities. No tax liens are currently in effect against any of the Companys
or any Subsidiarys assets other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable
or due but not delinquent, or that are being contested in good faith, and in
each case for which an adequate accrual or reserve in accordance with GAAP has
been established in the Company Financial Statements. There is not in effect
any waiver by the Company or any Subsidiary of any statute of limitations with
respect to any taxes nor has the Company or any Subsidiary agreed to any
extension of time for filing any Return that has not been filed; and neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary have consented to extend to a date later than
the Agreement Date the period in which any tax may be assessed or collected by
any taxing authority. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a "personal
holding company" within the meaning of the Code. The Company and each
Subsidiary have withheld all taxes, including federal and state income taxes,
FICA, Medicare, FUTA and other taxes, required to be withheld, and paid such
withheld amounts to the appropriate taxing authority within the time
prescribed by law. Since their inception, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has been a "United States real property holding corporation," as
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code and in Section 1.897-2(b) of the
Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (the _"Regulations"_ ), and the Company
and each Subsidiary have filed with the Internal Revenue Service all
statements, if any, with its United States income tax returns which are
required under Section 1.897-2(h) of the Regulations. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is a party to nor has any obligation under any tax-sharing, tax
indemnity or tax allocation agreement or arrangement. The Company and
the Subsidiaries have not filed any disclosures under Section 6662 of the
Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law to prevent the
imposition of penalties with respect to any tax reporting position taken on
any Return. The Company and the Subsidiaries have not consummated, have not
participated in, and are not currently participating in any transaction which
was or is a "tax shelter" transaction as defined in Sections 6662, 6011, 6012
or 6111 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations



 

21  promulgated thereunder. The Company and the Subsidiaries have never been a
member of a consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group of which
the Company was not the ultimate parent corporation. The Company has no
liability for the taxes of any person (other than the Company and the
Subsidiaries) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law) as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise. The Company and the Subsidiaries have
never been nor will be required to include any material adjustment in taxable
income for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date
pursuant to Section 481 or 263A of the Code or any comparable provision under
state or foreign tax laws as a result of transactions, events or accounting
methods employed prior to the Merger. There is no limitation currently
applicable to the Company on the utilization of net operating losses, capital
losses, built-in losses, tax credits or similar items of the Company and the
Subsidiaries under Sections 269, 382, 383, 384 or 1502 of the Code (and any
comparable provisions of foreign, state, local or municipal law). Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary have ever been distributed in a transaction
qualifying under Section 355 of the Code, and neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary have ever distributed any corporation in a transaction qualifying
under Section 355 of the Code. The Company does not have any debt outstanding
that is convertible into any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of the
Company.



3.7.2 For the purposes of this Section 3.7, the terms  _"tax"_ and _"taxes"_
include all federal, state, local and foreign income, alternative or add-on
minimum income, gains, franchise, excise, property, property transfer, sales,
use, employment, license, payroll, ad valorem, documentary, stamp,
withholding, occupation, recording, value added or transfer taxes,
governmental charges, fees, capital duties, customs duties, levies or
assessments (whether payable directly or by withholding), and, with respect
to any such taxes, any estimated tax, interest, fines and penalties or
additions to tax and interest on such fines, penalties and additions to tax.



3.8 _Company Financial Statements_. The Company has delivered to Acquirer as
attachments to _Schedule 3.8.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) audited
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2002 and January
31, 2003, (ii) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of
July 31, 2003, (iii) the Companys audited consolidated statements
of operations, statements of cash flows and statements of changes in
stockholders equity for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2002 and January
31, 2003, and (iv) the Companys unaudited consolidated statements of
operations, statements of cash flows and statements of changes in
stockholders equity for the six-month period ended July 31, 2003 (all such
financial statements of the Company and any notes thereto, together with the
financial statements of the Company delivered to Acquirer pursuant to Section
9.17, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the _"Company Financial
Statements"_ ). A true and correct description of all critical accounting
policies used in preparing the Company Financial Statements have been set
forth in the notes to the Companys audited Company Financial Statements. The
Company Financial Statements: (a) are derived from and are in accordance with
the books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries; (b) fairly present
the financial condition of the Company and the Subsidiaries at the dates
therein indicated and the results of operations for the periods therein
specified; and (c) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
basis consistent with prior periods except for any absence of notes to any of
the unaudited Company Financial Statements. The Company and the Subsidiaries
have no debt, liability, obligation or commitment of any nature, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether due  



 

22  or to become due, except for those (a) shown on the Companys unaudited
balance sheet as of July 31, 2003 included in the Company Financial
Statements (the _"Balance Sheet"_ ) and (b) that may have been incurred after
July 31, 2003 (the _"Balance Sheet Date"_ ) in the ordinary course of the
Companys and the Subsidiaries business consistent with its past practices
and that are, individually or in the aggregate, not material to the business
results of operations or financial condition of the Company and the
Subsidiaries. All reserves established by the Company that are set forth in
or reflected in the Balance Sheet were reasonably established in accordance
with GAAP and based on historical rates. Except for obligations and
liabilities reflected in the Company Financial Statements, the Company has no
material off-balance sheet obligation or liability of any nature (matured or
unmatured, fixed or contingent) to, or any financial interest in, any third
party or entities, the purpose or effect of which is to defer, postpone,
reduce or otherwise avoid or adjust the recording of debt expenses incurred
by Company. The Company Financial Statements comply in all material respects
with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position 97-2. The Company has not had any dispute with any of its auditors
regarding accounting matters or policies. To the Companys knowledge, there
are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or
operation of the Companys or the Subsidiaries internal controls which
could adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data. To the Companys knowledge, there is no fraud in
connection with the Financial Statements, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls.



3.9 _Title to Properties_. The Company and each Subsidiary have good and valid
title to, or valid leasehold interests in or other valid rights to use, all of
the assets and properties (including those shown on the Balance Sheet) used
in the Company Business, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than
Permitted Encumbrances. Such assets are sufficient for the continued operation
of the Company Business in all material respects. To the Companys knowledge,
all machinery, vehicles, equipment and other tangible personal property owned
or leased by the Company or the Subsidiaries or used in the Company Business
are in reasonable condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted, and
all leases of real or personal property to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party are fully effective and afford the Company peaceful and
undisturbed leasehold possession of the real or personal property that is the
subject of the lease. To the Companys knowledge, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is in violation, in any material respect, of any zoning, building,
safety or environmental ordinance, regulation or requirement or other law or
regulation applicable to the operation of its owned or leased properties, nor
has the Company or any Subsidiary received any written or, to the Companys
knowledge, other notice of violation of law with which it has not complied in
any material respect. The Company and the Subsidiaries do not own any real
property. The Company has delivered to Acquirer a list, complete and accurate
in all material respects, of all personal property, including capital
equipment, owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary with
an individual value of $1,000 or greater.

of any Company Product or Service as part of the Company Business (i) does not
violate in any material respect any material Company IP Rights Agreement or
other material license or contract  



 

29  between the Company and the Subsidiaries and any third party and (ii) does
not infringe or misappropriate in any material respect any material
Intellectual Property right of any third party. There is no pending or
threatened claim or litigation contesting either (i) the validity, or
ownership or rights of the Company and the Subsidiaries to, any Company IP
Right or (ii) the Companys or any Subsidiarys right to use, make, market,
license, sell, or distribute any Company Product or Service as part of the
Company Business, nor to the Companys knowledge, is there any reasonable
basis for any such claim. The Company and the Subsidiaries have not received
any notice asserting that the exercise of any Company IP Right or the current
or proposed use, development, manufacture, marketing, license, sale, or
distribution of any Company Product or Service infringes or misappropriates,
or will infringe or misappropriate, any Intellectual Property right of any
third party or conflicts or will conflict with the rights of any third party,
nor, to the Companys knowledge, is there any reasonable basis for any such
assertion. The Company and the Subsidiaries have not received any written
notice from any third party requesting that the Company or any Subsidiary
enter into a license under any third party patents. None of the Company IP
Rights or Company Products or Services is subject to any outstanding order or
stipulation restricting in any manner the use, distribution, transfer, or
licensing by the Company or any Subsidiary of any Company IP Rights or Company
Product or Service.



3.13.4 To the Companys knowledge, no current or former employee, consultant
or independent contractor of the Company and the Subsidiaries: (a) is in
material violation of any term or covenant of any employment contract, patent
disclosure agreement, invention assignment agreement, nondisclosure
agreement, noncompetition agreement or any other Contract with any other
party by virtue of such employees, consultants or independent contractors
being employed by, or performing services for, the Company or any Subsidiary
or using trade secrets or proprietary information of others without
permission; or (b) has developed any technology, software or other
copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work for the Company or any
Subsidiary that is subject to any agreement under which such employee,
consultant or independent contractor has assigned or otherwise granted to any
third party any rights (including Intellectual Property) in or to such
technology, software or other copyrightable, patentable or
otherwise proprietary work. To the Companys knowledge, the employment of any
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or the use by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the services of any consultant or independent contractor does
not subject the Company or any Subsidiary to any liability to any third party
for improperly soliciting such employee, consultant or independent contractor
to work for the Company or any Subsidiary, whether such liability is based on
contractual or other legal obligations to such third party.



3.13.5 The Company and the Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable steps to
protect, preserve and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of the Company-
Owned IP Rights, and to preserve and maintain all the Companys interests and
proprietary rights in the Company-Owned IP Rights. All current and former
officers, employees and consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary having
access to proprietary information of the Company, its customers or business
partners and inventions owned by the Company and the Subsidiaries,
have executed and delivered to the Company an agreement regarding the
protection of such proprietary information and the assignment of inventions to
the Company or such Subsidiary (in the case of proprietary information of the
Companys or Subsidiarys customers and business partners, to the extent
required by such customers and business partners); and copies of all such
agreements have been  



 

30  delivered to Acquirers legal counsel. The Company and the Subsidiaries have
secured valid written assignments, from all of the Companys and
the Subsidiaries current and former consultants and contractors who
contributed to the creation or development of any Company-Owned IP Rights, of
the rights to such contributions that the Company does not already own by
operation of law. No current or former employee, officer, director,
consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary has any
right or license in or with respect to any Company-Owned IP Rights. To the
extent that any technology, software or Intellectual Property developed or
otherwise owned by a third party is incorporated into, integrated or bundled
with, or used by the Company or the Subsidiaries in the development,
manufacture or compilation of any of the Company Products or Services (
_"Third Party Product Technology"_ ), a list and description of all such Third
Party Product Technology is set forth on _Schedule 3.13.5_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.



3.13.6 _Schedule 3.13.6_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of all registrations made by or on behalf of the Company and the

Internet domain names, Internet or World Wide Web URLs or addresses held by
the Company and the Subsidiaries are valid, enforceable, and subsisting, and
the Company or a Subsidiary is the record owner thereof.

and to all Company-Owned IP Rights free and clear of all Encumbrances
(other than licenses and rights listed on _Schedule 3.13.7_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of
the Company Business consistent with past practice). To the knowledge of the
Company, the right, license and interest of the Company and the Subsidiaries

Encumbrances, licenses and rights (other than licenses and rights listed on
_Schedule 3.13.7_ of the Company Disclosure Letter).



3.13.8 _Schedule 3.13.8_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of (i) all licenses, sublicenses, and other Contracts as to

(ii) all licenses, sublicenses and other Contracts as to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party and pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary
is currently authorized to use any third party Intellectual Property; and
(iii) all rights of any Governmental Authority relating to any Company IP
Rights, including rights to distribute, sublicense, acquire, modify, develop
software or services incorporating, or otherwise use any Company IP Right.



3.13.9 Except pursuant to the Contracts disclosed on _Schedule 3.13.9_ ,
neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any other party acting on behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary has disclosed or delivered to any party, or
permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other party of,
any Company Source Code (as defined below). Except as disclosed on _Schedule
3.13.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that shall, or would reasonably be expected
to, result in the disclosure or  



 

31  delivery by the Company or any Subsidiary or any other party acting on its
behalf to any party of any Company Source Code. _Schedule 3.13.9_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each Contract (whether written or
oral) pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary has deposited, or is or
may be required to deposit, with an escrow agent or other party, any Company
Source Code and further describes whether the execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in and of itself, would reasonably be expected to result in
the release from escrow of any Company Source Code. As used in this Section
3.13.9, _"Company Source Code"_ means, collectively, any software source code,
or any material portion or aspect of the software source code, or any material
proprietary information or algorithm contained in or relating to any software
source code, of any Company-Owned IP Rights or any Company Product or Service.



3.13.10 To the Companys knowledge, there is no material unauthorized use,
disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Company IP Rights by any
third party, including any employee or former employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.13.10_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company and the Subsidiaries has not agreed to
indemnify any person for any infringement of any Intellectual Property of any

provided by the Company or any Subsidiary.

required in Contracts with such customers) to applicable contractual
commitments, express and implied warranties, product specifications and
product documentation and to any representations provided to customers, and
the Company and the Subsidiaries have no material liability (and, to the
Companys knowledge, there is no basis for any present or future action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand against
the Company and the Subsidiaries giving rise to any material liability
relating to the foregoing Contracts) for replacement or repair thereof or
other damages in connection therewith in excess of any reserves therefor
reflected on the Balance Sheet. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries
have received any written notice of any material malfunctions with respect to
any of the Companys or the Subsidiaries products or any other customer
complaints related thereto and, to the Company knowledge, there are no such
malfunctions or complaints. The Company has made available to Acquirer all
material documentation and notes relating to the testing of the Companys and
the Subsidiaries software products and plans and specifications for software
products currently under development by the Company and the Subsidiaries.

educational institution or research center (other than loans or funds received

of the Company Products or Services. To the knowledge of the Company, no
current or former employee, consultant, or independent contractor of the
Company and the Subsidiaries who was involved in, or who contributed to, the
creation or development of any Company Product or Service or material Company
IP Rights has performed services for the government, for a university, college
or other educational institution or for a research center during a period of

Authority, arbitrator or mediator that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, enjoin or materially alter or delay any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or that if determined adversely to Acquirer
or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors
(in their capacities as such), would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquirer. There is no judgment, decree or order outstanding against Acquirer

responsibilities, except pursuant to Acquirers ESPP (as defined below). Each
Company Participant, to the extent permitted by law, applicable tax
qualification requirements, the terms of Acquirers employee benefit plans (as
such plans may be readily amended) and the carriers administering such plans,
and subject to any applicable break in service or similar rule, shall receive
credit for all purposes, including for eligibility to participate, matching
contributions, and vesting under Acquirer employee benefit plans, for years
of service with the Company (and its Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to
the Closing Date (except to the extent such service credit will result in
duplication of benefits), provided that Acquirer shall use reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of its employee benefit plan carriers to such service
credit. If applicable, to the extent permitted by law, applicable tax
qualification requirements, the terms of Acquirers employee benefit plans (as

purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar
requirements under any Acquirer employee benefit plans in which they are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date. Acquirer agrees that, from
and after the Closing Date, the Company employees who become employees of
Acquirer or any of its subsidiaries may participate in the employee stock
purchase plan sponsored by Acquirer (the _"Acquirer ESPP"_ ), subject to the
terms and conditions of the Acquirer ESPP, and that service with the Company
shall be treated as service with Acquirer or its subsidiaries for determining
eligibility of the Companys employees under the Acquirer ESPP.

amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to
cooperate with the others counsel and auditors in the preparation of the

other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
California Commissioner or its staff and of any request by the California

Company Options in connection with the Merger in violation of any applicable
federal or state securities laws.



6.8.4 Each of the Company and Acquirer shall use its reasonable efforts to

of Company Stock and/or Company Options and at all times subsequent thereto
(through and including the Effective Time), contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall
promptly advise Acquirer, and Acquirer shall promptly advise the Company, in
writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either the Company or
Acquirer shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or
appropriate to amend or supplement the Hearing Notice, the Permit Application,
and/or the Information  



 

53  Statement, in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by

and Acquirer shall cooperate in delivering any such amendment or supplement
to all the holders of Company Stock and/or Company Options and/or filing any
such amendment or supplement with the California Commissioner or its staff
and/or any other government officials.



6.8.5 In the event that the California Commissioner notifies Acquirer or the
Company of the California Commissioners determination not to grant the
Hearing, not to permit the mailing of the Notice of Hearing and/or not to
issue the Permit (or that any of the foregoing will be conditioned upon a
material alteration to the terms of this Agreement, any exhibit or schedule
hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby), then Acquirer
shall file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or any similar successor
form thereto) with the SEC in connection with the issuance of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock in the Merger, together with a proxy

statement on Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC. Each of the Company
and Acquirer will notify the other promptly (i) upon the occurrence of any
event which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
proxy statement/prospectus or the registration statement on Form S-4 or (ii)
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to proxy

58 7.3 _Dissenting Shares_. If, in connection with the Merger, holders of Company
Stock are entitled to appraisal rights pursuant to the Delaware Law or, if
applicable, dissenters rights pursuant to Section 1300 et seq. of the
California Law, any shares of Company Stock held by Company Stockholders who
exercise and perfect such appraisal rights or, if applicable, dissenters
rights ( _"Dissenting Shares"_ ) shall not be converted into and represent a
right to receive shares of Acquirer Common Stock and cash consideration as
provided in Section 2.2.2, but shall be converted into the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the Delaware Law or, if applicable, the
California Law. The Company shall give Acquirer prompt notice (and in
no event more than two (2) business days) of any demand received by the
Company for appraisal of Company Stock or notice of exercise of a Company
Stockholders dissenters rights, and Acquirer shall have the right to control
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand. The Company
agrees that, except with Acquirers prior written consent, it shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for appraisal or exercise of dissenters rights. In the event
that any Company Stockholder fails to make an effective demand for payment or
fails to perfect his appraisal rights or dissenters rights or otherwise loses
his status as a holder of Dissenting Shares, Acquirer shall, as of the later
of the Effective Time or ten (10) business days from the occurrence of such
event, issue and deliver, upon surrender by such Company Stockholder of its
Company Certificate or Certificates, the shares of Acquirer Common Stock, and
the Cash Amount per share of Company Stock to which such Certificate or
Certificates relate, which such Company Stockholder would have been entitled
under Section 2.2.2, subject to the provisions of Section 2.2.4 (regarding
cancellation of Company-owned stock), Section 2.2.5 (regarding the elimination
of fractional shares of Acquirer Common Stock), Section 2.2.6 (regarding the
continuation of vesting and repurchase rights) and Section 2.5 (regarding
the withholding of the Escrow Fund).

the Representative pursuant to the terms of this Article 11 (including the
hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs) shall be
paid directly by the Company Stockholders to the Representative based on each
Company Stockholders Pro Rata Share; such amounts may be paid from the Escrow

Company Stockholders under this Article 11, but in any event before the
Release Date, arising from or relating to:



(a) Any item specified in Section 11.2; or

Until the Release Date, no delay on the part of Acquirer in giving the
Representative a Notice of Claim shall relieve the Representative or any
Company Stockholder from any of its obligations under this Article 11 unless
(and then only to the extent that) the Representative or the Company
Stockholders are materially prejudiced thereby.



11.6  _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.



11.6.1 Acquirer shall defend any Third-Party Claim, and the costs and
expenses incurred by Acquirer in connection with such defense (including
reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court
or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Damages for which Acquirer may
seek indemnification pursuant to a Claim made by any Acquirer Indemnified
Person hereunder.



 

68 11.6.2 The Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim
and may participate in settlement negotiations with respect to the Third-Party
Claim, provided however to the extent that receipt of such documents by the
Representative would affect any privilege of the Acquirer Indemnified Person
with respect to such documents, the Acquirer Indemnified Person and the
Representative shall enter into a joint defense agreement, upon terms
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, with respect to such Third-Party
Claim. No Acquirer Indemnified Person shall enter into any settlement of a
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); _provided_ , _however_
, that if the Representative shall have consented in writing to any such
settlement, then the Representative shall have been deemed to accept the
related Claim by any Acquirer Indemnified Person for indemnification under
Section 11.2 with respect to the amount of such settlement and all other
Damages related to such Third-Party Claim.



11.7 _Contents of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim by Acquirer given
pursuant to Section 11.5 shall contain the following information:



(a) that Acquirer or another Acquirer Indemnified Person has incurred, paid or
properly accrued (in accordance with GAAP) or reasonably believes it shall
have to incur, pay or accrue (in accordance with GAAP), Damages in an
aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim (which amount may be the
amount of damages claimed by a third party in an action brought against
any Acquirer Indemnified Person based on alleged facts, which if true, would
give rise to liability for Damages to such Acquirer Indemnified Person under
this Article 11); and



(b) a description in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to
Acquirer) of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged
Damages based on Acquirers reasonable belief thereof, including the identity
and address of any third-party claimant (to the extent reasonably available to
Acquirer) and copies of any formal demand or complaint, the amount of
Damages, the date each such item was incurred, paid or properly accrued, or
the basis for such anticipated liability, and the specific nature of the
breach to which such item is related.



11.8 _Resolution of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given by Acquirer
shall be resolved as follows:



(a) _Uncontested Claims_. If, within thirty (30) business days after a Notice
of Claim is received by the Representative, the Representative does not
contest such Notice of Claim in writing to Acquirer as provided in Section
11.8(b), the Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have consented,
on behalf of all Company Stockholders, to the recovery by the Acquirer
Indemnified Person of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of
Claim in accordance with this Article 11, including the forfeiture of Escrow
Shares (valued for such purpose at the average of the closing prices per share
of the Acquirer Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the five (5)
consecutive trading days prior to the date of forfeiture) and Escrow Cash,
and, without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final
judgment for damages against the Company Stockholders for such amount in any
court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.



 

69 (b) _Contested Claims_. If the Representative gives Acquirer written notice
contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a _"Contested Claim"_ )
within the 30 day period specified in Section 11.8(a), then Acquirer shall
have 30 days after its receipt of such written notice to respond in a written
statement to the objection of the Representative. If after such 30-day period
the Contested Claim remains unresolved, the Representative and Acquirer shall
attempt in good faith for 30 days thereafter to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to the Contested Claim. If no such agreement
can be reached after good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the
expiration of such 30 day period, either Acquirer or the Representative may
bring suit in the courts of the State of California and the Federal courts of
the United States of America located within the County of Santa Clara in the
State of California to resolve the matter. For purposes of this Section
11.8(b), Acquirer shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party unless
the trial court awards Acquirer more than one-half of the amount in dispute;
otherwise, the Company Stockholders shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing
party. The non-prevailing party to a suit shall pay its own expenses and the
expenses, including attorneys fees and costs, reasonably incurred by the
other party to the suit.



11.9 _Distribution of Escrow Fund_. Within ten business days after the Release
Date, Acquirer shall deliver to the Company Stockholders according to their
Pro Rata Share the portion of the Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash that is in
excess of the amount of the Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash necessary to satisfy
any unsatisfied or disputed claims for Damages specified in any Notice of
Claim delivered to the Representative before the Release Date. As soon as all
such claims have been resolved in accordance with this Agreement, Acquirer
shall deliver, first to the Representative, all un-recovered fees and expenses
and second, to the Company Stockholders all remaining portions of the Escrow
Fund not required to satisfy such claims.



ARTICLE 12

MISCELLANEOUS



12.1 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. The internal laws of the State of
California, irrespective of its choice of law principles, shall govern the
validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the
interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that issues involving the consummation and effects of
the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. All
disputes arising out of this Agreement or the obligations of the parties
hereunder, including disputes that may arise following termination of this
Agreement, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
California State courts of Santa Clara County, California (or, if there is
federal jurisdiction, then the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California with venue in the
division thereof in which Santa Clara County is located). EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SAID COURTS AND WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY
OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION
OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WAS BROUGHT
IN AN INCONVENIENT COURT AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM THE SAME.



12.2 _Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns_. No party hereto may
assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of the other parties  



 

70  hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquirer may assign this Agreement and
the rights and obligation hereunder without consent in connection with any
merger or sale of the portion of its business to which this Agreement relates.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment
in violation of this provision shall be void.



12.3 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to
effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to use
their reasonable efforts to replace such void or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of the void or
unenforceable provision.



12.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any party
whose signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or
more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the
signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.



12.5 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law on such
party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of
any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or
any state having jurisdiction.



12.6 _Amendment and Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.
The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance
hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any
succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto as provided in this Section 12.6 at any time before or after
approval of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, but, after such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by Applicable Law requires the
further approval of the Company Stockholders without obtaining such further
approval. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and
Acquirer, by action taken by its Board of Directors, may, to the extent
legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to it contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for its benefit contained herein. No such waiver or
extension shall be effective unless signed in writing by the party against
whom such waiver or extension is asserted. The failure of any party to enforce
any of the provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the
right of such party thereafter to enforce such provisions.



 

71 12.7 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, each party shall
bear its respective legal, auditors, investment bankers, purchaser
representatives and financial advisors fees and other expenses incurred with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby.



12.8 _Attorneys  Fees_. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any
part of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as
an element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys fees
to be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any appeal).
The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit,
regardless of whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.



12.9 _Notices_. All notices and other communications required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered
in person, sent by facsimile, sent by certified or registered first-class
mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally recognized express courier
service next day delivery. Such notices and other communications shall be
effective upon receipt if hand delivered or sent by facsimile, five (5) days
after mailing if sent by mail, and one day after dispatch if sent by express
courier, to the following addresses, or such other addresses as any party may
notify the other parties in accordance with this Section 12.9:

hereto or any other person unless specifically provided otherwise herein and,
except as so provided, all provisions hereof shall be personal solely between
the parties to this Agreement.



12.14 _Public Announcement_. Upon execution of this Agreement, Acquirer and
the Company shall issue a press release approved by both parties announcing

other disclosures regarding the Merger, as it determines are required under
applicable securities laws or regulatory rules or are otherwise appropriate.
The Company shall not issue any press release or make any other public
statement regarding the Merger without Acquirers prior written consent. Prior
to the publication of such initial and mutually agreed press release, neither
party shall make any public announcement relating to this Agreement or the
