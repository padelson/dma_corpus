(b) The Disbursing Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange

Entity; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the
Disbursing Agent from their obligations to make the payments required by this
Article II, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United
States and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, in

transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for

 



-16-  the Merger Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be
in customary form and will specify that delivery or transfer of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass,
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares to
the Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of such Certificate(s) or transfer of
such Book-Entry Share(s) to the Disbursing Agent together with a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (in the case of
Certificates) and any other documentation that the Disbursing Agent may
reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor, without interest. Until so
surrendered (or transferred) and exchanged, each such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, and until such surrender (or transfer) and exchange, no cash shall be
paid to the holder of such outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
respect thereof.

 

(d) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s) surrendered (or transferred) in exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition to such payment that the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) so
surrendered (or transferred) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Disbursing Agent any applicable transfer and other similar Taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the
Disbursing Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

 

(e) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event
within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Disbursing Agent to pay to the holders of record of the shares of Class A
Preferred Stock and Subsidiary Preferred Interests, the Company Preferred
Consideration and the Subsidiary Preferred Consideration in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Class A Preferred Stock or Subsidiary
Preferred Interests, as applicable.

 

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company of the Shares or the shares of Class A Preferred Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Entity, Parent or the Disbursing Agent, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article II.

 

(g) If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to
Parent or the Surviving Entity upon demand, and any holder who has not
surrendered (or transferred) such holders Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s) for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of
the Merger Consideration. The foregoing notwithstanding, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Disbursing Agent or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to
any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for an amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the
date on which such amounts

 



-17-  would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving
Entity on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(h) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Merger Shares,
shares of Class A Preferred Stock or Subsidiary Preferred Interests
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Merger Shares, shares of Class A Preferred
Stock or Subsidiary Preferred Shares, other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, Company Preferred Consideration or Subsidiary Preferred
Consideration, as applicable, as provided in this Agreement.

 

(i) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting by
such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity or
the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Surviving Entity or the Disbursing Agent with respect to such
Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration in respect thereof entitled
to be received pursuant to this Agreement.

(j) Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Disbursing Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement any amounts required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Tax Law. To the
extent any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes as having been paid to the person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject solely to service-based
vesting conditions (each, a " _Service-Based Company Option_ "), whether
vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and exercisable and be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share of such Service-Based Company Option and (ii) the number of Shares
subject to the Service-Based Company Option. Any Service-Based Company Option
that has an exercise price that is equal to or exceeds the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to performance-based
vesting conditions (each, a " _Performance-Based Company Option_ "), shall, by
virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, become vested and exercisable to the extent provided for in the
applicable award agreement relating to such Performance-Based Company Option
and each such Performance-Based Company Option that becomes so vested and
exercisable shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per Share of such Performance-Based Company

 



-18-  Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to the Performance-Based
Company Option. Any Performance-Based Company Option that does not become
vested or exercisable in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence
or that has an exercise price that is equal to or exceeds the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined,
in the case of Company Restricted Stock Awards subject to performance-based
vesting conditions, assuming applicable performance goals are fully
satisfied).

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest (to the extent
unvested) and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each
Share underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(e) The Surviving Entity shall pay the amounts described in this Section
2.7 (together with any accrued but unpaid dividends or dividend equivalents
corresponding to the Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company RSU Awards,
respectively, that vest in accordance with Section 2.7(c) and Section 2.7(d)),
less applicable Tax withholdings, as soon as administratively practicable
(and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days) following the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent that payment
of the amounts described in this Section 2.7 with respect to Company Equity
Awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code would otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty
under Section 409A of the Code, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to
make such payment at the earliest time permitted under the Company Stock Plan
and applicable award agreement that would not result in the imposition of such
Tax or penalty.

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the
Company and/or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (i) effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.7 and (ii) ensure that the Company Stock Plan
shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.8 _Intended Income Tax Treatment of the Mergers_. Each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees to treat, for U.S. federal and state income tax
purposes, (i) each of the Mergers as a taxable sale or exchange by the
relevant merging entity of all of its assets to and the assumption of all of
its liabilities by Merger Sub, followed by a liquidation of the relevant
merging entity under Sections 331 or 332 of the Code (which in the case of the
Subreit Mergers, the Holdco REIT Merger and the Company Merger shall be deemed
to give rise to a distribution under Section 562(b) of the Code), (ii) this
Agreement as a "plan of liquidation" of each of the merging entities for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and (iii) such deemed sales, assumptions and
liquidations as occurring in the order in which the Subreit Merger, the
Holdco REIT Merger, the TRS Merger and the Company Merger occur and the
parties hereto shall not take any position

 



-19-  contrary thereto in any U.S. federal income Tax Return or tax proceeding
unless otherwise required by Law.

with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and

processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to

certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

Subsidiaries have been claimed, proposed, or assessed in writing by any

agreements or arrangements the primary subject of which is not Taxes.

 

(j) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries other than Permitted Liens.

of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to

(n) other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, settle or compromise any litigation or release, dismiss or
otherwise dispose of any claim or arbitration not covered by insurance, other
than settlements or compromises of litigation, claims or arbitration that do
not, individually or in the aggregate, involve the payment of more than $15

non-monetary relief on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) any

(t) take any action, or fail to take any action, which action or failure

Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is
later than the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the End Date.

(i) as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event within thirty (30)
Business Days after the date hereof, prepare the Company Proxy Statement and

requirements of Law applicable to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Parent

Proxy

 



-45-  Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, prior to mailing the
Company Proxy Statement to its stockholders.

 

Section 7.2 _Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to
assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Law to consummate and make effective the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents to obtain as promptly as
practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) taking all steps as
may be necessary, subject to the limitations in this Section 7.2, to obtain
all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances,
waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 7.2(a), each of the parties shall give any notices to
third parties, and each of the parties shall use, and cause each of their
respective Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any third
party consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
parties will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of
any required filings or submissions with any Governmental Authority and will
cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including promptly informing the other parties of such inquiry, consulting in
advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental
Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between either party and its
Affiliates and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. To
the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties or their Representatives shall
have the right to review in advance and each of the parties will consult the
others on, all the information relating to the others and each of
their Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such
exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, none of the parties shall,
nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate
independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other parties reasonable prior notice of such
meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
without giving the other parties the opportunity to attend or participate
(whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental
Authority.

 

(c) In connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person
(other than a Governmental Authority) with respect to the Mergers, the
Company or any of its Affiliates shall not pay or commit to pay to any Person
whose approval or consent is being solicited

 



-46-  any cash or other consideration or incur any liability to such Person
without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause Partner to effect the Plan Closing as promptly as practicable and in
accordance with the Alternative Plan Sponsor Agreement, including by using
reasonable best efforts to cause Partner to take all necessary or desirable
action to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or desirable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in order to effect
the Plan Closing in accordance with the Alternative Plan Sponsor Agreement.

Section 7.3 _Access to Information_. Subject to the restrictions imposed
by federal and state securities Laws and other Laws, the Company will provide,
will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to
provide Parent and Merger Sub and their respective authorized
Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice (a) such access to the offices, properties, Company Facilities, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (so long as such access does
not interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Company Facilities) as Parent or Merger Sub reasonably may
request and (b) all documents that Parent or Merger Sub reasonably may
request. The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent, Merger Sub and their
Representatives shall not have access to any books, records, documents and
other information (i) to the extent prohibited by the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party, (ii) to the extent that the
disclosure thereof would, in the opinion of the Companys counsel, be
reasonably likely to result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (in which
case, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
result in a loss or waiver of privilege) or (iii) to the extent required by
Law. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 7.4 _Solicitation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during
the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing until 11:59 p.m., New
York time, on June 9, 2018 (the " _Go-Shop Period End Time_"), the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have the right
to directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate and encourage, whether
publicly or otherwise, Acquisition Proposals from any third party, including
by way of providing access to non-public information or access to employees
or properties pursuant to one or more confidentiality agreements between the
Company and such Person with confidentiality provisions that are not less
restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") (and
to the extent non-public information that has not been made available to
Parent is made available to such Person, the Company shall provide or make
available such non-public information to Parent substantially concurrent with
the time that it is provided to such other Person); and (ii) enter into and
maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals
with any third party or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in,
or facilitate any inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or the
making of any Acquisition Proposal from any third party. Parent shall not,
and shall cause

 



-47-  each of its Affiliates not to, interfere with or prevent the participation
of any Person, including any director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any bank, investment bank or other potential
provider of debt or equity financing, in negotiations and discussions
permitted by this Section 7.4(a).

 

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 7.4, from the Go-Shop Period
End Time until the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage the submission of any proposal that constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish
any non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any third-party Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) in connection with
or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with a third-party
Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Representatives)
making (or who could reasonably be expected to make) an Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) approve or recommend (or publicly propose to approve or recommend) any
Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into any letter of intent, term sheet,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, exchange
agreement or any other agreement with a third-party Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement if
otherwise permitted pursuant to this Section 7.4) or requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Mergers or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or (vi) resolve or agree to do any of the
foregoing;  _provided_ , that, the Company and its Representatives may
continue to take any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above from the Go-Shop Period End Time with respect to any Excluded Party.

(c) Anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.4(b) notwithstanding,
from the Go-Shop Period End Time and prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Vote, the Company, or the Board of Directors of the Company,
directly or indirectly through any Representative, may (i) furnish non-public
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, and afford
access to the business, properties, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, any Person and (ii) engage and participate in
discussions and negotiations with any Person, in each case in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company, prior to
taking any such particular action, concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Offer;
_provided_ that (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material
breach of this Section 7.4 and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn
prior to the taking of such action, (B) the Company provides to Parent the
notice required by this Section 7.4(c) with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, and (C) the Company furnishes any non-public information provided
to the maker of the Acquisition Proposal only pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and such Person and to the
extent non-public information that has not been made available to Parent is
made available to the maker of the Acquisition Proposal, the Company provides
or makes available such non-public information to Parent substantially
concurrent with the time that it is provided to such other Person; _provided_
, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Representatives
may continue to take any of the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii)
above with respect to any Excluded Party without any restrictions or
obligations contained in this Section 7.4(c). Within three (3) 

 



-48-  Business Days following the Go-Shop Period End Time, the Company shall
advise Parent of any written Acquisition Proposal received during the Go-Shop
Period and in respect of which the Company is engaged in ongoing negotiations
as of the Go-Shop Period End Time, and from and after the Go-Shop Period End
Time, the Company shall promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, advise Parent of such
Acquisition Proposal (in each case, including providing the identity of the
Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal and, (i) if the
Acquisition Proposal is oral, a reasonably detailed summary of the material
terms and conditions thereof or (ii) if the Acquisition Proposal is in
writing, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and any related draft agreements
provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries or Representatives). From and
after the Go-Shop Period End Time, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of any change to the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal and shall provide, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
to Parent (i) if any such change to the material terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal is oral, a detailed summary of such change or (ii)
if any such change to the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal is in writing, a copy of the so modified Acquisition
Proposal and any related draft agreements provided to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Representatives.

 

(d) Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall prohibit the Company, or the Board of
Directors, directly or indirectly through any Representative, from (i)
informing any Person of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.4, or
(ii) disclosing, in the Company Proxy Statement or otherwise, factual
information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the fact that an Acquisition
Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such Acquisition
Proposal or the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_
that, in the case of this clause (ii), the Company shall in good faith
determine that such information, facts, identity or terms is required to be
disclosed under applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. So long as
the Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied with this Section
7.4, none of the foregoing shall prohibit the Company and its Representatives
from contacting any Persons or group of Persons that have made an Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification
of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Acquisition
Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Offer,
and any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 7.4.

 

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.4(e), Section 7.4(f) and
Section 7.4(g), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof may (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, the Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent, or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any such
action, a " _Recommendation Withdrawal_ "). Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board
of Directors of the Company may at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Vote, make a Recommendation Withdrawal and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii), if: (i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal
(that did not result from a material breach of Section 7.4(b)) is made after
the date of this Agreement to the Company by a third party, and such
Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, and (B) the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior

 



-49-  Offer and that a failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (ii) (A) the Company
provides Parent a four (4)-Business Day prior written notice of its intention
to take such action, which notice shall include the information with respect
to such Superior Offer that is specified in Section 7.4(c), (B) after
providing such notice and prior to making such Recommendation Withdrawal in
connection with a Superior Offer or taking any action pursuant to Section
9.1(c)(ii) with respect to a Superior Offer, the Company shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent during such four (4)-Business Day period (to the
extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms
of this Agreement as would permit the Board of Directors of the Company not to
effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in connection with a Superior Offer or to
take such action pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) in response to a Superior
Offer, and (C) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Offer if such changes offered in writing by
Parent were to be given effect;  _provided_ that, in the event that the
Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of such
modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this Section
7.4(e), except that the Companys advance written notice obligation shall be
reduced to two (2) Business Days (rather than the four (4)-Business Days
otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.4(e)).

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look
and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder.

(g) Other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall be subject
to Section 7.4(e) and shall not be subject to this Section 7.4(g)), nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of Directors of the
Company from making a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to an Intervening
Event to the extent that the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal would
be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall take any of the actions set
forth in this Section 7.4(g) unless the Company has first complied with the
provisions of Section 7.4(e), treating the occurrence of such Intervening
Event as if a Superior Offer had been received and after so complying, the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the
failure to make a Recommendation Withdrawal would be inconsistent with
the exercise of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

(h) During the period from the Go-Shop Period End Time through the
Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate, materially amend or modify or
waive any provision of any confidentiality agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or standstill agreement to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party (other than any involving Parent or any Excluded
Party). During such period, the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts
to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and subject
to the fiduciary duties of

 



-50-  the Companys Board of Directors, the provisions of any such agreements,
including obtaining injunctions to prevent any material breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in
any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to take, or
be prohibited from taking, any action otherwise prohibited by this Section
7.4(h), if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors,
after consultation with outside counsel of the Company, such action or
inaction, as the case may be, would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates)

Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, (A) directly or
indirectly acquires (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, and whether through merger, share-exchange, spin-off, asset
sale, tender offer, exchange offer, business combination, consolidation or

immediately prior to such transaction or series of related transactions would
cease to beneficially own (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange
Act) at least 75% of the voting stock or equity interests of any surviving
entity or entity that immediately following such transaction or series of
transactions owns, together with such entitys subsidiaries, businesses or
assets that immediately prior to such transaction or series or transactions
constituted 25% or more of the assets, revenues or cash flows of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or any direct or indirect parent
company of such an entity or any such surviving entity),
immediately following such transaction or series of related transactions;

(ii) " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person, group of Persons or group that
includes any Person (so long as such Person and the other members of such
group, if any, who were members of such group immediately prior to the Go-

group at all times following the Go-Shop Period End Time and prior to the
termination of this Agreement) that submitted to the Company after the date
hereof and as of or prior to the Go-Shop Period End Time an Acquisition
Proposal or with whom the Company is having ongoing discussions
or negotiations as of the Go-Shop Period End Time regarding a potential
Acquisition Proposal (or any amendment or modifications thereto) and that the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined, in good faith, no later
than three (3) Business Days following the Go-Shop Period End Time that such
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer;

 



-51- (iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means an event, change, fact, circumstance,
occurrence or development (other than an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal) that (A) is material to the Company, (B) was not known

if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known to or
understood by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement, and (C) becomes known or the material consequences of which become
known to or understood by to the Board of Directors of the Company prior to

contemplated hereby; and

 

(iv) " _Superior Offer_ " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
(except the references therein to "25%" and "75" shall be replaced by "50%"),

Company than the transactions contemplated hereby, taking into account all
factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company, including
timing and likelihood of consummation and any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement.

Section 7.5 _Director and Officer Liability_. (a) The Surviving Entity
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, assume the obligations
with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from

Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Pa_ _r_ _ties_ ") as provided in the Company
Articles, the Company Bylaws or any indemnification Contract between such
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as
in effect on the date hereof), without further action, as of the Effective
Time and such obligations shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall maintain
in effect in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries,
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions that are
no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the
Companys and its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
similar organizational documents as in effect as of the date hereof or in any
indemnification Contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
Indemnified Party as in effect as of the date hereof, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries
to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants
contained in this Section 7.5.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, indemnify and hold harmless each Person that is an
Indemnified Party or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, fiduciary

 



-52-  or employee of another Person, against any Damages incurred in connection
with any Action arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including in connection with any actions or omissions
taken at the request of Parent, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under Law and the Company Certificate of Incorporation or
Company Bylaws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to also advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law).

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and are not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer or convey all or substantially all of
its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

(d) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance (or such other insurance that is no less
favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a copy of which
has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company may, at its election,
obtain a "tail" policy with respect to such directors and officers
liability insurance with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as
favorable to the directors and officers covered under such insurance policy as
the limits, terms and conditions in the existing policies of the Company;
_provided_ , _fu_ _r_ _ther_ , that in connection with this Section 7.5(d),
neither the Company nor Parent shall pay a one-time premium (in connection
with a tail policy described above) in excess of 600% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company for directors and officers liability insurance
or be obligated to pay annual premiums (in connection with any other
directors and officers insurance policy described above) in excess of 300%
of the current annual premium paid by the Company for directors and officers
liability insurance. It is understood and agreed that in the event such
coverage cannot be obtained for such amount or less, then the Company shall
obtain the maximum amount of coverage as may be obtained for such amount.

 

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this Section 7.5; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Person
provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final
and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.5 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by,
each Indemnified Party, his or her

 



-53-  heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement,
including this Section 7.5, is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
7.5 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies. The provisions of this Section 7.5 shall survive the consummation of
the Mergers.

 

Section 7.6 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no takeover statute is or
becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such takeover
statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the
foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
to minimize the effect of such takeover statute on the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any
Recommendation Withdrawal or any action taken by the Company or its Board of
Directors pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 7.4, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, the parties shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or making any public announcement relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press
release or public announcement as may be required by Law, court process or any
listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange, shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public announcement without the consent
of the other parties (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent and
the Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable joint press release
announcing this Agreement.

 

Section 7.8 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and all of its Subsidiaries to honor
each of the Company Benefit Plans. Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and
each of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for each Company
Employee employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective
Time (" _Current Employee_ ") either, at Parents election, (i) the base
salary or wage rate and benefits (not including severance (which is addressed
in Section 7.8(c)) or equity-based compensation) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the base salary or wage rate and benefits (not
including severance or equity-based compensation) that each Current Employee
was receiving immediately before the Effective Time or (ii) the same
compensation and benefits that are provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to
their similarly situated employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that, nothing in
this Section 7.8 shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any
of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee at
any time in a manner consistent with any applicable contractual
obligations, Company Benefit Plans and Law.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Entity to, give each Current Employee full credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits under any Company
Benefit Plans or under any employee benefit plan,

 



-54-  program, policy or other arrangement of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each
case, which provides benefits to any Current Employees as of and after the
Effective Time (each, a " _Parent Plan_ "), for such Current Employees
service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their predecessor entities, to the same extent such service is recognized by
the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than as would result in a duplication of benefits or for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan). With respect to each
Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause any preexisting condition or eligibility
limitations or exclusions and actively-at-work requirements with respect to
the Current Employees and their eligible dependents to be waived and (ii) give
effect, for the year in which the Closing occurs, for purposes of
satisfying any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Current Employees and
their eligible dependents under similar plans maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in which such Current Employees and their eligible dependents
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) For one (1) year following the Effective Time, each Current Employee
shall continue to be eligible for severance benefits in amounts and on terms
and conditions no less generous than those which applied to such Current
Employee under the severance plans, programs, policies, agreements and other
arrangements of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and as
are set forth on Section 7.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment of bonuses for the
2018 calendar year under the Companys existing annual cash bonus programs
(the " _Existing Programs_ "), the Company shall, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, pay to each Company Employee who is otherwise eligible to
earn a cash bonus for calendar year 2018 under the Existing Programs a bonus
in an amount equal to the product of (i) such Company Employees target-level
bonus award under the applicable Existing Program, and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days from and including January 1, 2018
through and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 365.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant, or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no
event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Entity or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify
or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time; or (iii) to
confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant,
any right to employment or continued employment or continued service with
Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee.

 



-55- Section 7.9 _Rule  16b-3_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to
cause disposition of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law,
the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of the discovery by a party to this Agreement of any
fact, circumstance or event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which
could reasonably be likely to cause any of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII not to be satisfied prior to the End Date.

 

Section 7.11 _Real Property Leases_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will consult with Parent
with respect to, and keep Parent reasonably informed of, its communications
and negotiations with any lessors under Real Property Leases in connection
with (a) obtaining any consent of such parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) amending, waiving,
modifying, restating or renegotiating the existing terms of any material
Real Property Lease.

Section 7.12 _Certain Litigation_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company
shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Action commenced
after the date of this Agreement against the Company or any of its directors
by any stockholder of the Company (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates)
relating to this Agreement, the Mergers and the transactions contemplated
hereby and, unless inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company, shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any
such litigation. The Company shall not settle any such Action without the
prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) and subject to applicable Law and unless inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the
defense or settlement of any such Action and shall consider Parents views
with respect to such Action.

 

Section 7.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Law and the rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to
enable the delisting by the Surviving Entity of the Shares from the New York
Stock Exchange and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.14 _Resignation of Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause each member of the Board of Directors of the Company to
execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director
of the Board of Directors of the Company effective immediately prior to, and
subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time. 

Section 7.15 _Financing and Payoff Documentation_ _; Cooperation_.

 



-56- (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent
and Merger shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Letters (including any "flex" provisions related thereto) on or
prior to the Closing Date, and shall not, without the Companys prior written
consent, amend, supplement, modify, replace, terminate or agree to any waiver
of any provision or remedy under, any Financing Letter if such amendment,
supplement, modification, replacement, termination or waiver (i) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing unless the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing following such reduction, together with other financial
resources available to Parent (including amounts funded into an escrow account
with release provisions no less favorable in any material respect to Parent
and its Affiliates than the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letter), is sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and make the payments referred to in Section 5.7(e), (ii)
changes the conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing or adds new
or additional conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing (unless
such amendment, supplement, modification, termination or waiver results in
conditions that are no less favorable in any material respect to Parent and
its Affiliates than the conditions in the Financing Commitment Letter
immediately prior to such amendment, supplement, modification, termination or
waiver) or (iii) could reasonably be expected to (A) delay, prevent or make
less likely to occur the Closing, (B) delay, prevent or make less likely to
occur the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing), (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent and
its Affiliates to enforce their rights against the other parties to the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (D)
adversely affect the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and the Plan
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may amend or replace the
Financing Letters to (i) add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents, managers or similar entities who had not executed the Financing
Letters as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) implement or exercise any
"flex" provisions provided in the Financing Fee Letter as in effect on the
date hereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed,
on a reasonably current basis, as to the status of the Debt Financing and
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any amendment, supplement,
replacement, modification, waiver, withdrawal, repudiation or termination of
any of the Financing Letters. Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) use their reasonable best efforts to (I)
maintain in effect the Financing Letters and comply with their respective
obligations thereunder (including by paying, or causing to be paid, all fees
and other amounts that become due and payable under the Financing Letters)
except to the extent (A) there is a reduction of commitments in accordance
with the terms thereof, (B) any of the commitments under the Financing Letters
are replaced with Definitive Financing Agreements or (C) there is an
amendment, supplement, modification, replacement, termination or waiver in
accordance with this Section 7.15(a), Section 7.15(b) or Section 7.15(c), (II)
satisfy and cause each of its Affiliates to satisfy (or, if deemed advisable
by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to the Debt
Financing that are within Parent and its Affiliates control, (III) negotiate,
enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Letters (including any "flex" provisions
contained therein) so that such agreements are in effect no later than the
Closing and (IV) draw the Debt Financing in 

 



-57-  full to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and make the payments referred to
in Section 5.7(e).

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent may
substitute the cash proceeds received by Parent or a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (to the extent segregated and limited in use to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or funded into an escrow
account with release provisions no less favorable to Parent in any material
respect than the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing Letters) from
consummated debt or equity offerings or asset sales for all or any portion of
the Debt Financing by reducing commitments under the Financing Commitment
Letters; provided, that the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing following
such reduction, together with other financial resources available to Parent
(including amounts funded into an escrow account with release provisions no
less favorable in any material respect to Parent than the conditions
precedent set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters), is sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and make the
payments referred to in Section 5.7(e). If funds in the amounts set forth in
the Financing Letters, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, such that
Parent does not have financial resources sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and make the payments referred to
in Section 5.7(e), Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event to (x) notify the Company in writing thereof, (y) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are
not less favorable to Parent in any respect than the terms and conditions as
set forth in the Financing Letters, taking into account any "market flex"
provisions thereof) sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and make the payments referred to in Section
5.7(e) (the " _Substitute F_ _i_ _nancing_ ") and (z) use reasonable best
efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides for such
Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the
Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and the
related fee letters and related definitive financing documents with respect
to such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the "Debt
Financing".

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent may
substitute commitments in respect of other financing from the same and/or
alternative third-party financing sources for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing so long as (x) all conditions precedent to the availability of such
financing have been satisfied or are no less favorable in any material
respect to Parent and its Affiliates than the conditions precedent set forth
in the Financing Commitment Letter, (y) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing is not reduced as a result of such substitution if, as a result of
such reduction, such reduced amount would not be sufficient, together with
other financial resources available to Parent, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and make the payments referred to in Section
5.7(e) and (z) such commitment otherwise complies with Section 7.15(a) (any
such financing, a " _Replacement Commitment_ "). In the event that any new
commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with
any amendment, supplement, replacement, modification or waiver of the
Financing Letters permitted pursuant to Section 7.15(a), any Substitute
Financing or any Replacement Commitment, (1) any such new commitment letters
shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing Commitment Letter, (2) any
such new fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing Fee
Letter", (3) any such new commitment letters and fee letters shall be deemed
to be 

 



-58-  part of the "Financing Letters" and (4) any financing to be incurred
pursuant thereto shall be a part of the "Debt Financing".

 

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives
to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent such customary
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in
arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in filing or
maintaining registration statements of Parent on Form S-3, including:

 

(i) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent, within a reasonable
amount of time following Parents reasonable request, with information
available to the Company relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries required
to consummate the Debt Financing or required to file or maintain registration
statements of Parent on Form S-3, and providing reasonable assistance to
Parent with Parents preparation of pro forma financial information and
projections required to consummate the Debt Financing or required to file or
maintain registration statements of Parent on Form S-3 and, upon reasonable
notice and at mutually agreeable dates and times, participating in a
reasonable number of diligence sessions with proposed lenders, underwriters,
initial purchasers, placement agents or rating agencies; and

(ii) request the Companys independent accountants to provide assistance
and cooperation to Parent with respect to maintaining registration statements
of Parent on Form S-3, including requesting their participation in drafting
sessions and accounting due diligence sessions, requesting them to agree that
Parent may use their audit reports on the consolidated financial statements of
the Company in offering documents, registration statements and similar
documents (which may incorporate, by reference, periodic and current reports
filed by the Company with the SEC) customarily required in any filings made
with the SEC pursuant to applicable Law or to file or maintain registration
statements of Parent on Form S-3, and requesting them to provide customary
comfort letters, in each case, on customary terms and consistent with their
customary practice.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including Section 7.15(d)): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including Section
7.15(d)) shall require any such cooperation to the extent that it would (A)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other
fees, reimburse any expenses, otherwise incur any liabilities or give any
indemnities or provide any security prior to the Closing, (B) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries, (C) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter
into any agreement or other documentation or agree to any change or
modification of any existing agreement or other documentation, (D) require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective boards
of directors (or equivalent bodies) to pass resolutions or consents or
otherwise approve or authorize the Debt Financing, (E) cause any
representation, warranty covenant or other obligation in this Agreement, the
Plan Sponsor Agreement or any other document related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan Transactions to be breached by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (F) reasonably be expected to cause the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representative or equityholder of any
of the foregoing to incur any personal liability, (G) reasonably be expected

 



-59-  to conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, or a default (with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are a party, the organizational documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws, (H) provide access to
or require the disclosure of any information that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (I) require the
preparation of any audited financial statements or any other financial
statements or information that are not available to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and prepared in the ordinary course of the Companys
financial reporting practice and (ii) no action, liability or obligation
(including any obligation to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse any
expenses) of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument relating to the Debt Financing shall be effective until the
Closing.

 

(f) Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its or their Representatives in connection with any cooperation contemplated
by this Section 7.15 and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives against any claim, loss,
damage, injury, liability, judgment, award, penalty, fine, Tax, cost

documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees) or settlement payment incurred as a
result of, or in connection with, such cooperation or the Debt Financing,
except to the extent arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Company.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their respective obligations under this
Agreement are not in any way subject to the receipt or availability of any
funds or financing by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates (including
the Debt Financing) for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Plan Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in Section 7.15 represent the sole obligation of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with respect to
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing (including the
Debt Financing) to be obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Plan Transactions and no other provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to expand such obligations, and (ii) the failure of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to comply with
the provisions set forth in this Section 7.15 shall not be taken into account
with respect to whether any condition to the Closing set forth in this
Agreement shall have been satisfied.

 

(h) The Company hereby consents to the use of the trademarks and logos of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ , that such trademarks and logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 



-60- _(i) Treatment of Company Indebtedness._

 

(i) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver all notices and take all other
actions, in each case to the extent reasonably requested by the Parent, that
are reasonably necessary to facilitate the termination at the Effective Time
of all commitments in respect of the Company Credit Facilities, the repayment
in full on the Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the indebtedness
thereunder, and the release on the Closing Date of any Liens securing such
indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent (x) at least seven (7)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a draft payoff letter with respect
to the Company Credit Facilities and (y) at least one (1) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, an executed payoff letter with respect to the Company
Credit Facilities (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the applicable agent on behalf
of the Persons to whom such indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letter together
with any related release documentation shall, among other things, include the
payoff amount and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in
connection with the Company Credit Facilities relating to the assets, rights
and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing or relating to
such indebtedness, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the
applicable Payoff Letter, be released and terminated. The obligations of the
Company pursuant to this Section 7.15(i)(i) shall be subject to Parent and
Merger Sub providing or causing to be provided all funds required to effect
all such repayments at or prior to the Effective Time.

(ii) With respect to the Senior Notes, if requested by Parent in writing
no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in lieu of
commencing a Debt Offer (as defined below) for the Senior Notes (or in
addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture, use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) issue a
notice of redemption providing for the redemption no sooner than the Closing
Date of all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes
in accordance with Article Three of the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and
(B) take any actions reasonably requested by Parent that are reasonably
necessary to facilitate the defeasance, satisfaction and/or discharge of the
Senior Notes in accordance with Article Three of the Existing Senior Notes
Indenture; _provided_ , that prior to the Company being required to take any
of the actions described in clause (A) or (B) above that cannot be conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing, Parent shall have irrevocably deposited
with the trustee under the Existing Senior Notes Indenture sufficient funds to
effect such redemption or satisfaction and discharge; _provided further_ ,
that Parents counsel shall provide all legal opinions required in connection
with any such redemption or satisfaction and discharge.

 

(iii) Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct offers to purchase
or exchange, and conduct consent solicitations with respect to, any or all of
the outstanding Senior Notes on such terms and conditions, including pricing
terms and amendments to the terms and provisions of the Existing Senior Notes
Indenture, that are specified, from time to time, by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (each, a

 



-61-  " _Debt Offer_ " and collectively, the "Debt Offers") and which are
permitted by the terms of such Senior Notes, the Existing Senior Notes
Indenture and applicable Law, including SEC rules and regulations; _provided_
, that any such Debt Offer shall be consummated substantially simultaneously
with or after the Closing (and shall be expressly conditioned on the Closing)
solely using funds provided by Parent. The Company shall not be required to
take any action in respect of any Debt Offer, or to execute or deliver any
document in connection therewith (other than the execution of the supplemental
indentures relating to any consent solicitation undertaken in connection with
a Debt Offer, which supplemental indenture shall not become effective until
the Effective Time). Parent shall provide the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon all documentation required in
connection with such Debt Offer and shall ensure that all such documentation
(and the Debt Offer) shall comply with the requirements of this clause (iii)
(collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ "). Parent shall consult with the
Company regarding the timing of any Debt Offer in light of the regular
financial reporting schedule of the Company and the requirements of applicable
Law. Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable
efforts to, cause their respective Representatives to provide cooperation and
assistance reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any Debt Offer;
_provided_ , that (1) such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (2) the closing of any
such Debt Offer shall be expressly conditioned on the Closing, (3) such Debt
Offer shall be conducted in compliance with applicable Law, including
applicable SEC rules and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the
Senior Notes and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, as applicable, and (4)

any Debt Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Parent and Merger
Subs respective obligations under this Agreement are not in any way subject
to the consummation of any Debt Offer, a failure to consummate any offer or
consent solicitation contemplated by any Debt Offer (as described above) shall
not constitute a failure by the Company to satisfy its obligations under
this Section 7.15(i)(iii) and the failure of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to comply with the
provisions set forth in Section 7.15(i)(iii) shall not be taken into account
with respect to whether any condition to the Closing set forth in this
Agreement shall have been satisfied.

(iv) Following the commencement of any Debt Offer, Parent shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, make any change to the terms and
conditions of such Debt Offer, unless such change is previously approved by
the Company in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) or Parent reasonably determines, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that such change is required by applicable Law or the terms and
conditions of the Senior Notes or the Existing Senior Notes Indenture.

(v) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, on a current basis,
as to the status of communications with the holders of the Senior Notes in
connection with any Debt Offer.

to be jointly and severally responsible for the performance and compliance by
Partner and its Affiliates with the covenants and agreements set forth in the

suffered by the Company or any of its Affiliates or stockholders arising out
of, relating to, or in connection with the failure of Partner or any of its
Affiliates to perform or comply with the covenants and agreements set forth
in the Alternative Plan Sponsor Agreement.

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party if the failure of the

party shall have failed to use the required efforts under Section 7.2;

(ii) any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 8.1(b) shall be

Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to a party if such Restraint shall
be due to the failure of such party to perform in all material respects or
comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth in this Agreement or if such party shall have failed to use
the required efforts under Section 7.2; or

(iii) this Agreement shall have been voted upon at the Company Stockholder
Meeting (including any adjournment thereof), such Company Stockholder Meeting
shall have been completed, and the stockholders of the Company shall have

(c) by the Company, if:

thirty (30) calendar days following written notice of such breach to Parent

to this clause (y) if (1) any condition set forth in Section 8.1(a), Section
8.1(b) and Section 8.2 is not satisfied or capable of being satisfied on such
date or (2) the failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.1(c) to be
satisfied by such date was primarily caused by the failure of the Company or

material respects with the covenants and agreements set forth in the
Alternative Plan Sponsor Agreement and required to be performed or complied
with by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

 

(iv) any Restraint is in effect and shall have become final and
nonappealable that prohibits, restrains or renders illegal the Plan Closing
in accordance with the Alternative Plan Sponsor Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(c)(iv) shall not be available to the Company if such Restraint
shall have been primarily caused by the failure of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to perform in all material respects or comply in all material
respects with the covenants and agreements set forth in the Alternative Plan
Sponsor Agreement and required to be performed or complied with by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

 

(v) the Alternative Plan Sponsor Agreement has been terminated, unless the
breach of any provision of the Alternative Plan Sponsor Agreement by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is the primary cause of the termination of
the Alternative Plan Sponsor Agreement; or

 

(d) by Parent or Merger Sub, if:

 

(i) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which

8.2(b) not to be satisfied by the Closing, and such breach is incapable of
being cured or, if capable of being cured, such breach is not cured within
thirty (30) calendar days following written notice of such breach to the

where

 



-66-  (A) (x) such Willful Breach is the result of an isolated action by a person
that is a Representative of the Company (other than a director or senior
officer of the Company) without Knowledge of or consent by the Company prior
to such action, and is not any other action by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (y) such Willful Breach was not caused by the Company, was
not the result of an action taken by the Company and was not within the
Knowledge of the Company, and in the case of clauses (x) and (y), the Company
takes appropriate actions to remedy such Willful Breach upon discovery
thereof, or (B) Parent is not harmed in any material respect as a result
thereof; or

with by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

Affiliates (in the case of the payment of the Termination Fee) or Parent or
its Affiliates or the Financing Source Parties (in the case of payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee) shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that nothing
in this Section 9.2(f) shall relieve Parent of its obligations pursuant to
Section 7.16. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in
this Agreement shall relieve any party to the Alternative Plan Sponsor
Agreement for any liability for any breach of the Alternative Plan Sponsor
Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee or Parent be required to
pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In addition, the

integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that
without these agreements the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have

Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 9.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company under
this Agreement, other than the last sentence of Section 7.3, Section 7.16,
Section 9.2, this Section 9.3 and Article X, which provisions shall survive
such termination indefinitely; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or Damages
incurred or suffered by a party, to the extent such liabilities or Damages
were the result of fraud or the willful and material breach by another party
of any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

confer upon any Person other than the parties any legal or equitable rights or

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,

Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the

or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue
of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH

LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF

WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH

Financing, the Financing Letters or the transactions contemplated thereby,
whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any
of the Financing Source Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Financing Letters or the transactions contemplated thereby.

of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the parties and
their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that
any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
