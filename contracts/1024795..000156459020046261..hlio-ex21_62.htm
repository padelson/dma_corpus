(i)to each Stockholder a Letter of Transmittal, which shall specify the
instructions for effecting the surrender of all of such Stockholder's shares
of Common Stock (whether such shares are represented by stock certificates or
held in book-entry form) that each Stockholder must comply with prior to
receiving the consideration set forth in Section 2.6(c)(iv) and Section
2.6(c)(vi); and

   

(ii)to each Optionholder holding In-the-Cash Options and In-the-Stock Options,

2.8.Purchase Price Adjustment

 

(a)As promptly as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Equityholder
Representative (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company Group as of the
Adjustment Time, and (ii) a written statement (the "Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement") setting forth Parent's good faith calculation of (1) the Closing
Cash, (2) the Closing Net Working Capital, (3) the Closing Indebtedness, (4)
the Transaction Expenses, and (5) Parent's determination of the Aggregate
Closing Merger Cash Consideration based on the foregoing, together with such
schedules and data with respect to the determination thereof as may be
appropriate to support the calculations set forth in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement, all of which shall be prepared and determined in
accordance with this Agreement and the Accounting Principles.

 

(b)Following the delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, Parent
shall, upon reasonable notice, provide the Equityholder Representative and its
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Business Records, work papers and other documents that were used in, or are
relevant to, the preparation of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and
relevant personnel that prepared the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement
(collectively, "Access Rights") to verify the accuracy of such amounts, all to
the extent reasonably requested by the Equityholder Representative.

 

(c)If the Equityholder Representative disagrees with the calculation of any of
the items set forth in the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, the
Equityholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing of such
disagreement (an "Objection Dispute") within forty-five (45) days after
receipt of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement by the Equityholder
Representative (such forty-five (45) day period following the Equityholder
Representative's receipt of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, the
"Review Period"). If the Equityholder Representative fails to deliver written
notice of an Objection Dispute to Parent on or prior to the last day of the
Review Period, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement shall be deemed final
and binding on the Parties for purposes of this Agreement.

   

(d)If the Equityholder Representative delivers a notice of an Objection
Dispute pursuant to Section 2.8(c), Parent and the Equityholder Representative
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Objection Dispute and any
resolution agreed to in writing by Parent and the Equityholder Representative
shall be final and binding upon the Parties for purposes of this Agreement. If
Parent and the Equityholder Representative are unable to resolve all Objection
Disputes within twenty (20) days of delivery of written notice of such
Objection Disputes by the Equityholder Representative to Parent, then the
disputed matters shall, at the request of either the Equityholder
Representative or Parent, be referred for final determination to RSM US LLP
(the "Accounting Arbitrator") as promptly as practicable following the end of
such twenty (20) day period; provided that any communications between the
Equityholder Representative and Parent (or their respective Representatives)
during the aforementioned twenty (20) day period shall be considered
settlement discussions pursuant to the Federal Rule of Evidence 408 and
similar state rules. If such firm is unable to serve, Parent and the
Equityholder Representative shall jointly select an Accounting Arbitrator from
an accounting firm of national standing. If Parent and the Equityholder
Representative are unable to agree upon an Accounting Arbitrator within such
time period, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be an accounting firm of
national standing designated by the American Arbitration Association in New
York, New York; provided that the Accounting Arbitrator shall not have served
as auditor for, or provided any other services to, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or Topco or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall only consider those items and amounts set forth on the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement as to which Parent and the Equityholder
Representative have disagreed within the applicable time periods and on the
terms specified in Section 2.8(c) and this Section 2.8(d) and must resolve all
unresolved Objection Disputes in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Parent and the
Equityholder Representative, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within sixty (60) days) after its appointment, a written report setting forth
the resolution of any unresolved Objection Disputes determined in accordance
with the terms herein. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be bound by the principles set forth in this Section 2.8 and
shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either Parent or the Equityholder Representative or less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either Parent or the Equityholder
Representative. Such report shall be final and binding upon all of the Parties
for purposes of this Agreement, absent manifest error by the Accounting
Arbitrator or actual fraud. The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne by Parent and the Equityholder Representative,
respectively, in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the
disputed items submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator by such party that are
unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of disputed items submitted
by Parent and the Equityholder Representative. The Accounting Arbitrator shall
have the power to resolve any disputes regarding Access Rights. The Parties
agree that the Accounting Arbitrator's decision may be enforced as an
arbitration award in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

(e)Upon the written agreement of Parent and the Equityholder Representative or
the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, or if the Equityholder
Representative fails to deliver written notice of an Objection Dispute on or
prior the last day of the Review Period as provided in Section 2.8(c), the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as modified pursuant to the written
agreement of Parent and the Equityholder Representative or the decision of the
Accounting Arbitrator, as applicable, shall be deemed to be the final Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement for

   

purposes of this Section 2.8 (the "Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement")
and shall be deemed to be final and binding on the Parties for purposes of
this Agreement. The Closing Cash, the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness, and the Transaction Expenses, each as shown on the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, shall be referred to as the "Final
Closing Cash", the "Final Closing Net Working Capital", the "Final Closing
Indebtedness", and the "Final Transaction Expenses", respectively.

 

(f)If the Final Aggregate Closing Merger Cash Consideration exceeds the
Aggregate Estimated Closing Merger Cash Consideration (the amount of such
excess, the "Net Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount"), then Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash an amount equal to the lesser of the
Net Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount
to the Paying Agent to be deposited in the Exchange Fund and to be further
distributed therefrom to the Equityholders in accordance with Section 2.8(h).
In addition, in the event of a Net Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
or in the event that the Final Aggregate Closing Merger Cash Consideration
equals the Aggregate Estimated Closing Merger Cash Consideration, the
Equityholders will be entitled to receive the entire balance of the Adjustment
Escrow Account, and Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver a
Joint Direction instructing to the Escrow Agent to make payment of such amount
to the Paying Agent to be deposited in the Exchange Fund and to be further
distributed therefrom to the Equityholders in accordance with Section 2.8(h).

 

(g)If the Aggregate Estimated Closing Merger Cash Consideration exceeds the
Final Aggregate Closing Merger Cash Consideration (the amount of such excess,
the "Net Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount"), then Parent shall be
entitled to receive a payment in cash out of the Adjustment Escrow Account in
an amount equal to the lesser of the Net Negative Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and Parent and the Equityholder
Representative shall deliver a Joint Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to
make a payment to Parent in an amount equal to the lesser of the Net Negative
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount and the total amount of funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account. Recovery from the Adjustment Escrow Account shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any claims arising out of or
relating to the Net Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount and none of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any claim against any Equityholder or any of the
Retained Subsidiaries in respect thereof. In addition, if the Adjustment
Escrow Amount is greater than the Net Negative Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount, then Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver a Joint
Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to make a payment out of the Adjustment
Escrow Account of an amount equal to the difference between the Adjustment
Escrow Amount and the Net Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount to the
Paying Agent to be deposited in the Exchange Fund and to be further
distributed therefrom to the Equityholders in accordance with Section 2.8(h).

 

(h)Payments to any Equityholder pursuant to the terms of Section 2.8(f) or
Section 2.8(g) shall be made as follows:

 

(i)to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to each Stockholder who is
not a Dissenting Stockholder, with respect to each share of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by such Stockholder
(and for which a properly

   

completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal has been properly delivered
to the Paying Agent), an amount equal to the sum of (1) the Net Positive
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount Per Share, if any, plus (2) the Adjustment
Escrow Release Amount Per Share, if any (which amount, for the avoidance of
doubt, will be paid in cash);

 

(ii)to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to each holder of In-the-
Cash Options with respect to each share of Class B Common Stock underlying
each In-the-Cash Option (and for which a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal has been properly delivered to the Paying Agent), an
amount equal to the sum of (1) the Net Positive Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount Per Share, if any, plus (2) the Adjustment Escrow Release Amount Per
Share, if any (which amount, for the avoidance of doubt, will be paid in cash
and effected by way of payment to the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries for payroll or other applicable payment processing by the
Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary and distribution at the
next administratively practicable payroll date to such holders of In-the-Cash
Options);

 

(iii)to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to each holder of In-the-
Stock Options, with respect to each share of Class B Common Stock underlying
each such In-the-Stock Option (and for which a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal has been properly delivered to the Paying
Agent), a fraction of a share of Class B Topco Stock (and not cash) having a
value equal to the sum of (A) the Net Positive Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount Per Share, if any, plus (B) the Adjustment Escrow Release Amount Per
Share, if any; provided that to the extent that after the delivery of such
shares of Class B Topco Stock to the holder of an In-the-Stock Option pursuant
to this Section 2.8(h)(iii) such Optionholder would have received, in respect
of one (1) In-the-Stock Option, more than one (1) share of Topco Stock, the
provisions of this Section 2.8(h)(iii) shall be revised in accordance with
Section 2.8(i);

 

(iv)to the Exchange Fund, to be held in trust for the benefit of the
Stockholders and holders of In-the-Cash Options who are not receiving payment
pursuant to Section 2.8(h)(i) or Section 2.8(h)(ii), an amount equal to the
cash consideration that would have been payable to such Stockholders and
Optionholders, as applicable, had they received payment of such cash
consideration pursuant to Section 2.8(h)(i) or Section 2.8(h)(ii), as
applicable; and

 

(v)by Topco to the Paying Agent, to be held in trust for the benefit of
holders of In-the-Stock Options who are not receiving the consideration set
forth in Section 2.8(h)(iii), a number of shares of Class B Topco Stock that
would have been issued to such Optionholders had they received payment of such
stock consideration pursuant to Section 2.8(h)(iii).

 

(i)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.8(h), if any Option
that was an In-the-Stock Option at the Closing becomes an In-the-Cash Option
as a result of the provisions of Section 2.8(h) (each such Option, a
"Subsequent In-the-Cash Option"), then (1) the provisions of Section 2.8(h)
(and all applicable related definitions in this Agreement) shall be revised,
and (2) all calculations made in connection with this Section 2.8 shall be
adjusted to take into account the effect of the additional In-the-Cash
Options. This Section 2.8(i) shall be applied with the effect that each
Subsequent In-the-Cash Option shall be entitled to receive the appropriate
portion of the Aggregate Merger Cash Consideration Per Share (as recalculated
pursuant to this

   

Section 2.8(i) taking into account the Net Positive Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount Per Share, if any, and Adjustment Escrow Release Amount Per Share, if
any) that is in excess of the per share exercise price of such Subsequent In-
the-Cash Option, it being understood that, applying this Section 2.8(i) and
after taking into account amounts previously received by Stockholders and
holders of In-the-Cash Options and In-the-Stock Options, the payment of the
Net Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount Per Share, if any, and the
Adjustment Escrow Release Amount Per Share, if any, may be different for
different Equityholders.

 

(j)All cash payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be
made in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds within five (5)
Business Days following the final determination of the Final Aggregate Closing
Merger Cash Consideration.

 

(k)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the process set
forth in this Section 2.8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Parties for any disputes related to items required to be included or reflected
in the calculation of the Closing Cash, the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Closing Indebtedness, and the Transaction Expenses, and the resulting
determination of the Aggregate Closing Merger Cash Consideration.

 

(l)The Parties agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.8
and Section 10.1(e) as an adjustment to the merger consideration for federal,
state, local and foreign income Tax purposes.

 

2.9.Withholding Taxes

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub (and their Affiliates) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other
payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent
or Merger Sub (or their Affiliates) may be required to deduct and withhold
with respect to any such deliveries and payments under applicable Law;
provided, however, that Parent shall use reasonable efforts to provide the
Equityholder Representative with notice of any such intended withholding
(other than any withholding on amounts properly treated as compensation for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes) at least five (5) days before the making of
such withholding, and Parent shall cooperate in good faith with the
Equityholder Representative to obtain any available exception from, or
reduction in, such withholding to the extent permitted under applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

Group, and the possession or exploitation of the Purchased Intellectual

the date hereof, infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise conflict with
any Intellectual Property of any Person that is not a member of the Company

confidentiality of the material Company Group Owned Intellectual Property,
including Trade Secrets and Source Code in the Company Group Owned
Intellectual Property.

conducted. Each member of the Company Group uses reasonable means to protect
the security and integrity of all Information Systems used by such member of
the Company Group. No member of the Company Group will lose access to any
Information System used by the Company Group as a result of the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

(h)No member of the Company Group or any other Person acting on behalf of any
member of the Company Group has disclosed or delivered to any third party that
is not an employee or consultant of a member of the Company Group that had a
need to access, or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or
other party of, any Source Code in a Company Group Product and that is Company
Group Owned Intellectual Property. No event has occurred, and no circumstance
or condition exists, that (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
will, or would reasonably be expected to, require the disclosure or delivery
by any member of the Company Group or any Person acting on behalf of any
member of the Company Group to any third party of any such Source Code. The
Source Code for each Company Group Product is stored in a secure storage
accessible only by controlled access procedures, including access limited to
only those employees and contractors of the Company Group who need access to
improve upon, update, modify or fix bugs in such Source Code. Schedule
3.10(h) sets forth an accurate and complete list of each Contract under which
any member of the Company Group has deposited, or is or may be required to
deposit, with an escrow agent or other third party, any such Source Code. Each
member of the Company Group has entered into confidentiality and nondisclosure
Contracts with each of its employees and contractors and any other Person with
access to such Source Code

   

or other Trade Secrets of the Company Group to protect the confidentiality and
value of such Source Code and Trade Secrets. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the businesses of the Company Group, there has not
been any breach by any of the foregoing of any such agreement. Neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the Contemplated
Transactions, in and of itself, would reasonably be expected to result in the
release of any such Source Code from escrow.

 

(i)There are no known material problems or defects in any Software embodied in
any of the Company Group Products that prevent the Company Group Products from
operating substantially as described in their related documentation or
specifications, or as otherwise warranted to any third party and such Company
Group Products materially operate in accordance with their documentation and
specifications and have no other material problems or defects.

 

(j)The Company Group Products and any Source Code of any Software embodied
therein do not contain any Open Source Materials. The Company Group Products,
and the Source Code of the Software embodied therein or associated therewith
are not subject to any terms of license of any such Open Source Materials that
result in the grant of, or require any member of the Company Group to grant, a
license to any of the Company Group Products or such Source Code. No member
of the Company Group is in breach of any of the material terms of any license
to any such Open Source Materials. Software embodied in or associated with any
of the Company Group Products that link with, use or include works distributed
under the LGPL only link to such works using a shared library mechanism as
described in the LGPL.

 

(k)Each member of the Company Group has, during the last three (3) years,
complied in all material respects with all relevant requirements of any
applicable data protection Law and Orders. No member of the Company Group has
received any Order or other notification from any Governmental Authority
regarding non-compliance or violation of any data protection principles or
Law. No Person has claimed any compensation from any member of the Company
Group for the loss of or unauthorized disclosure or transfer of personal data,
and to the Knowledge of the Company Group, there are not any facts or
circumstances that exist that might give rise to such a claim insofar as the
same relate to the business of any member of the Company Group.

3.16.Employee Benefits

 

(a)Schedule 3.16(a) lists all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) and all other bonus, stock option, stock purchase, other
equity-based arrangement, savings, disability, incentive, deferred
compensation, retirement, severance, retention, change in control, salary
continuation, vacation, sick leave, or other employee benefit plans,
arrangements, agreements, Contracts or programs, maintained, sponsored, or
contributed to or required to be contributed to, by the Company Group for the
benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employees, independent
contractors and directors of the Company Group or under which the Company
Group has any liability with respect to any such individual, other than (i)
those plans, programs or arrangements that the Company Group is required to
maintain or contribute to pursuant to applicable Laws, and (ii) any
arrangement that constitutes a Company Group Employment Contract
(individually, a "Plan," collectively, the "Plans").

 

(b)With respect to each Plan, to the extent applicable, the Company Group has
provided to Parent accurate and complete copies of: (i) all current Plan
documents, (ii) all current funding documents in respect of any Plan which is
required to be funded and all material administrative arrangement documents,
including trust agreements, insurance contracts, custodial agreements and
investment manager agreements, (iii) the latest favorable determination or
opinion letter received from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regarding
the qualification of each Plan covered by Section 401(a) of the Code, (iv) the
most recently filed Form 5500 for each Plan that

   

is an employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and
for each Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA), (v) each summary plan description and each summary of material
modification regarding the terms and provisions thereof, (vi) the two (2) most
recent financial statements and actuarial or other valuation reports prepared
with respect thereto, (vii) the most recent written results of all required
compliance testing, and (viii) copies of any material correspondence with the
IRS, U.S. Department of Labor, or other Governmental Authority. There has been
no amendment to, announcement by any member of the Company Group relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Plan that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of
the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year.

 

(c)Each Plan and each Company Group Employment Contract (i) has been
maintained, operated, and administered in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Laws, Orders, statutes, regulations and rules issued by a
Governmental Authority and (ii) has been operated in compliance in all
material respects with its terms. There have been no prohibited transactions
or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning
of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Plans that could
result in any liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on
any member of the Company Group.

 

(d)Each Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code is the
subject of a favorable determination letter from the IRS to the effect that
such plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code,
respectively, and, to the Knowledge of the Company Group, nothing has occurred
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of
such Plan.

 

(e)The Company Group has not failed to make any minimum required contribution
as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Sections 412 and 430 of the Code or has
otherwise failed to comply with the minimum funding standards set forth in
such sections with respect to any "pension plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA) maintained by the Company Group which is subject to
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or Sections 430-432 of the Code. No
liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than required premium payments) has
been incurred by the Company Group (or may be incurred by reason of any
transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA).

 

(f)No Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or other pension plan, in each case, that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA, or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning
of Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code or a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.
Neither any member of the Company Group nor any ERISA Affiliate has sponsored
or contributed to, or been required to contribute to, a Multiemployer Plan or
other pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA at any time within the
previous six (6) years that would reasonably be expected to result in any
liability to, or obligation of, any member of the Company Group.

 

(g)No Plan or Company Group Employment Contract provides for post-employment
health or welfare benefits except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.
Each Plan that is subject to the Affordable Care Act has been established,
maintained and administered

   

in compliance with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including all
notice and coverage requirements, and each member of the Company Group offers
minimum essential health coverage, satisfying the affordability and minimum
value requirements, to its full time employees (as defined by the Affordable
Care Act) sufficient to prevent liability for assessable payments under
Section 4980H of the Code.

 

(h)No Plan or Company Group Employment Contract provides benefits to any
individual who is not a current or former employee of a member of the Company
Group, or the dependents or other beneficiaries of any such current or former
employee. The Company has reserved all rights necessary to amend or terminate
each of the Plans without the consent of any other Person.

 

(i)Each Plan and each Company Group Employment Contract that constitutes in
any part a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code and that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
been operated and maintained in all material respects in operational and
documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance
thereunder during the respective time periods in which such operational or
documentary compliance has been required. There is no Contract to which the
Company or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound
to compensate any employee for excise Taxes paid pursuant to Section 409A of
the Code.

 

(j)With respect to the Plans and the Company Group Employment Contracts, (i)
all contributions, transfers, and premium payments required to be paid with
respect to and (ii) all benefits, expenses, and other amounts due and payable
under, have been paid, made or accrued prior to the date hereof and all such
amounts that are required prior to the Closing Date will have been paid, made
or accrued on or before the Closing Date. With respect to any insurance policy
providing funding for benefits under any Plan, there is no liability of any
member of the Company Group in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment,
loss sharing arrangement, or other actual or contingent liability, nor would
there be any such liability if such insurance policy was terminated on the
date hereof.

 

(k)As of the date hereof, there is no pending material Litigation by or on
behalf of any Plan, any employee or beneficiary covered under any Plan or any
Governmental Authority involving any Plan, nor to the Knowledge of the Company
Group, has any member of the Company Group received any written notice
threatening any such Litigation (in each case other than routine claims for
benefits).

 

(l)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions (either alone or in connection with any other
event) will: (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer, director or
other individual service provider of any member of the Company Group (or
dependents of such Persons) to payment, vesting, distribution, or increase in
benefits or compensation; (ii) result in any acceleration of vesting or
payment of benefits or compensation or otherwise; (iii) trigger any obligation
to fund any benefits, compensation, or Plan; or (iv) result in any payment or
benefit (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section l.280G-l) that could, individually or in combination with any other
such

   

payment, as of the Closing, constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(l) of the Code).

Company Group have been filed (taking into account extensions of time to file)

will not (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, or (b) assuming that all
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by Section 5.4 have been
obtained and all filings described therein have been made, conflict with or
violate in any material respect any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or
by which their respective properties are bound. Neither Parent or Merger Sub
nor their respective Affiliates are subject to any Contract that would
materially impair or delay Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.

 

5.4.Governmental Authorizations and Consents

 

No Governmental Consents are required to be obtained or made by Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the execution, delivery and performance,
validity and enforceability of this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents to
which it is, or is to be, a party, or the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub
of the Contemplated Transactions, except for such filings as may be required
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws and such Governmental
Consents which, if not made or obtained, as the case may be, would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.5.Litigation

 

As of the date hereof, there is no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent or Merger Sub, threatened against or involving Parent or Merger Sub
which questions the validity of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Documents to which it is a party or seeks to prohibit, enjoin or otherwise
challenge Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions or would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no Order to which
Parent or Merger Sub is subject that would have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

5.6.Sufficiency of Funds

 

As of the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have, and as of
the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub will have, access to sufficient and
unrestricted cash on hand or otherwise readily available to pay all
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder, including the Aggregate
Closing Merger Cash Consideration, and all of the out-of-pocket costs, fees
and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub arising from the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, including the Merger. In no event shall the receipt
by, or the availability of any funds or financing to Parent or any of its
Affiliates or any other financing be a condition to Parent's or Merger Sub's
obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

 

5.7.Investment Purpose

 

Parent is acquiring the Company Group solely for the purpose of investment and
not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution
thereof other than in compliance with all applicable Laws, including United
States federal securities Laws. Parent agrees that no Equity Securities of the
Company may be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration under the Securities Act and such Laws. Parent is able to bear
the economic risk of holding its investment

   

in the Company for an indefinite period (including total loss of its
investment), and has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its
investment.

 

5.8.Solvency

 

No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions with the actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company
Group. At and immediately after the Closing, and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties in ARTICLE III and that the Company complied in
all material respects with the covenants contained in Section 6.1, immediately
after giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions including the payment of
the Final Aggregate Closing Merger Cash Consideration, the Company Group (a)
will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets will not be less
than the sum of its debts and that the present fair saleable value of its
assets will not be less than the amount required to pay its probable
liabilities on its debts as they become absolute and matured); (b) will have
adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage in its business; and (c)
will not have incurred and does not plan to incur debts beyond its ability to
pay as they become absolute and matured and will own property which has a fair
saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts (including a
reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities).

 

5.9.No Brokers

 

 None of Parent, Merger Sub nor or any of their respective Affiliates has
employed or incurred any liability to any broker, finder or agent for any
brokerage fees, finder's fees, commissions or other amounts with respect to
this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the Contemplated Transactions.

 

5.10.Operations of Merger Sub

 

Since the date of its incorporation, Merger Sub has not engaged in any
activities other than in connection with, or as contemplated by, this
Agreement.

 

5.11.No Inducement or Reliance; Independent Assessment

 

(a)Parent and Merger Sub have not been induced by and have not relied upon any
representations, warranties, statements, or other information whether express
or implied, made or provided by the Company Group Parties or any other Person,
except for the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set
forth in ARTICLE III and the Ancillary Documents and the representations and
warranties of Topco expressly set forth in ARTICLE IV and the Ancillary
Documents, whether or not any such representations, warranties, statements, or
other information were made in writing or orally. Parent and Merger Sub
represent and warrant that no Company Group Party or any other Person has made
any representation or warranty, express or implied, oral or written, including
any implied warranty of merchantability or of fitness for a particular
purpose, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company Group or the Contemplated Transactions except for the representations
and warranties expressly given by the Company in ARTICLE III and the Ancillary
Documents and the representations and warranties given by Topco in ARTICLE IV
and the Ancillary Documents, and absent fraud, none of the Company Group
Parties will have or be subject to any liability to Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives, or the use by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives, of
any information, including publications, any confidential information
memorandum or data room information provided to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives, or any other document or information in any form provided to
Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions. Parent and

   

Merger Sub acknowledge that they have inspected and conducted, to their
satisfaction, their own independent investigation of the Company Group and
their financial conditions, results of operations, assets, liabilities and
properties and, in entering in this Agreement and making the determination to
proceed with the Contemplated Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub have relied
on the results of their own independent investigation and analysis.

 

(b)Except for the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set
forth in ARTICLE III and the Ancillary Documents and the representations and
warranties of Topco set forth in ARTICLE IV and the Ancillary Documents,
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that none of the Company Group Parties
makes, will make or has made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, including as to the prospects of the Company Group, the Retained
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or their profitability for Parent
or Merger Sub or any other Person, or with respect to any forecasts,
projections or business plans made available to Parent and Merger Sub (or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives) in connection with Parent's
and Merger Sub's review of the Company Group and if applicable, of the
Retained Subsidiaries. PARENT AND MERGER SUB HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III AND THE
ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS, PARENT AND MERGER SUB ARE ACQUIRING THE COMPANY GROUP ON
AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS.

6.2.Access Prior to the Closing

the Closing Date and the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to ARTICLE
IX, the Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives
reasonable access during regular business hours and upon reasonable notice to
all offices, facilities, books and records (financial and otherwise) of the
Company Group as Parent and Merger Sub may reasonably request; provided that
(a) Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably

   

with the business or operations of the Company Group; (b) Parent and Merger
Sub and their Representatives shall take such action as is deemed necessary in
the reasonable judgment of the Company Group to schedule such access and
visits through a designated officer of the party providing access and in such
a way as to avoid disrupting in any material respect the normal business of

hereof until the Closing Date or the earlier termination of the Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE IX, it is not authorized to, and shall not (and shall not
permit any of its Representatives or Affiliates to) contact and communicate
with the employees, customers, providers, service providers, landlords, and
suppliers of the Company Group without the prior consultation with and written
approval of the Company or the Equityholder Representative; provided, however,
that the foregoing restriction shall not prohibit any contacts by Parent or
Parent's Representatives or Affiliates with the customers, providers, service
providers, landlords, and suppliers of the Company Group in the Ordinary
Course unrelated to the Contemplated Transactions.

 

6.3.Efforts; Regulatory Filings

 

(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, and shall cause their Affiliates to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to cause their Affiliates to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, as soon as practicable, the Contemplated Transactions,
including (i) the obtaining of all Governmental Consents and the making of all
filings, registrations, or declarations, specified in Section 3.5 and Section
5.4 and the taking of all necessary steps to obtain such Governmental Consents
and to make such registrations, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any

consummate the Contemplated Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall not, and

   

shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, and the Company shall not
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, take or agree to take any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE VII not being satisfied or to impair, prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

(b)In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 6.3(a), each of Parent and,
where applicable, the Company undertakes and agrees to make or cause to be
made the registrations, declarations and filings required of such Party under
the HSR Act (in no event later than ten (10) Business Days from the execution
of this Agreement) (the "Antitrust Filings") with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and Parent and the Company shall request early termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company
shall (A) subject to applicable Law, furnish to the other Party as promptly as
reasonably practicable all information required for any Antitrust Filing,
application or other filing to be made by the other Party pursuant to any
applicable Antitrust Law in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, (B)
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from any state attorney general or other
Governmental Authority in connection with such Antitrust Filings,
registrations, declarations and filings or with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions, and (C) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter
into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the
other Parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, take any and all steps reasonably necessary
to (i) resolve, avoid, or eliminate any impediment or objection, if any, under
any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any
state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, and (ii) avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution
of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Order that would
prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, so to enable the Parties to close the Contemplated Transactions
expeditiously (but in no event after the Termination Date); provided that
nothing in this Agreement will require Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Affiliates to offer, accept or agree, or commit to agree, to a
Divestiture Condition; provided, further the Company Group shall not, without
Parent's prior written consent, offer, accept or agree, or commit to agree, to
any Divestiture Condition. Parent and the Company shall share equally any
filing fees required under Antitrust Laws, including the HSR Act.

 

(c)Each Party shall (i) promptly notify the other Parties of any material
communication or any Divestiture Request to that Party from the FTC, the
Antitrust Division, any state attorney general or any other Governmental
Authority in respect of any Antitrust Filing, investigation, inquiry,
presentations, analyses, appearances, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions,
proposals or other proceeding relating to the Contemplated Transactions and,
subject to applicable Law, discuss with and permit the other Party (and its
counsel) to review in advance, and consider in good faith the other Party's
reasonable comments in connection with any proposed written communication to
any of the foregoing; (ii) not participate or agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call, or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any Antitrust Filing, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions unless it consults
in good faith with the other Party in advance and, to the extent

   

permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party reasonable
advance notice and the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; (iii)
subject to applicable Law, furnish the other Party promptly with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions; and (iv) act in good faith and reasonably
cooperate with the other Party in connection with any Antitrust Filings,
registrations, declarations and filings concerning this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions and in connection with resolving any investigation
or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law with respect to any such Antitrust Filing registration,
declaration and filing or the Contemplated Transactions; provided, that each
Party may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
competitively sensitive material provided under this Section 6.3 as "outside
counsel only material" and may redact materials to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Company or to address privilege or
confidentiality or business secrets concerns.

 

(d)Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to,
acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing
a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or increase the
risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, Orders, declarations or
approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering
an Order prohibiting the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or
(iii) delay the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

6.4.Employee Matters

 

(a)For a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, each
individual who is employed by any member of the Company Group as of
immediately prior to the Closing and for the avoidance of doubt, following the
consummation of the Reorganization Transactions (the "Company Group
Employees"), shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation or
its applicable Subsidiaries or Affiliates at least the same salary and wages
and cash incentive compensation opportunities that were provided to them
immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(b)For a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, each
Company Group Employee shall receive employee benefits (including severance,
retirement, welfare and fringe benefits, but excluding any benefits under a
retiree medical plan, deferred compensation plan, retention or change in
control plan and equity compensation), that at least are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits (including severance,
retirement, welfare and fringe benefits, but excluding any benefits under a
retiree medical plan, deferred compensation plan, retention or change in
control plan and equity compensation) that such individual was provided
immediately prior to the Closing.

   

(c)For purposes of participation of a Company Group Employee in a benefit plan
of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) (a "Parent
Benefit Plan"), Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that each Company Group Employee
shall be credited with all years of service for which such Company Group
Employee was credited before the Closing Date under any comparable Plan,
except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Company Group
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all Parent Benefit Plans to the extent that coverage under
such Parent Benefit Plans replaces coverage under comparable Plans in which
such Company Group Employee participated; (ii) for purposes of each Parent
Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Company Group Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Benefit Plan be waived for such
Company Group Employee and his or her covered dependents, and (iii) any
eligible expenses incurred by such Company Group Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Plan ending on
the date such Company Group Employee's participation in the corresponding
Parent Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account under such Parent Benefit
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Group Employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plan.

 

(d)Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) to (i) credit each of the Company Group
Employees with an amount of paid vacation and sick leave days following the
Closing Date equal to the amount of vacation time and sick leave days each
such Company Group Employee has accrued but not yet used or cashed out as of
the Closing Date under the Company Group's vacation and sick leave policies as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) allow each of the
Company Group Employees to use such accrued vacation and sick leave days at
such times as each would have been allowed under the Company Group's vacation
and sick leave policies as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(e)Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be solely responsible for any
notices required to be given under, and to otherwise comply with, the Workers
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or similar Laws or regulations of
any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar
triggering event) resulting from Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's
actions, or the actions of any of their applicable Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
in each case, with respect to the layoff or termination of employment of any
Company Group Employees on or after the Closing Date.

 

(f)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company Group shall use reasonable best
efforts to solicit the requisite approval of the Company Group's direct or
indirect stockholders entitled to vote to the extent required by and in the
manner prescribed under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, of the right of any "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive or retain
any payments that could, in the absence of such approval, constitute "excess
parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), including
any payments or other benefits to be provided under

   

any agreement or arrangements established by Parent that are intended to
become effective on or after Closing, provided Parent has notified the Company
Group or the Company Group is otherwise aware, of any such agreement or
arrangement prior to the vote described in this Section 6.4(f). Prior to
seeking such approval, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to seek
and obtain waivers from the intended recipients of such payments such that
unless such payments are approved to the extent required by and in the manner
prescribed under 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Company Group shall not be required to make such
payments. The Company Group shall provide Parent with drafts of all such
solicitation and disclosure materials and consents, along with the Company
Group's Section 280G calculations and analysis (including any reasonably
requested backup data for the same) (collectively, the "280G Documents") for
review and comment at least two (2) Business Days prior to delivery to
stockholders or disqualified individuals, as applicable (such review and
comment not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company
agrees to incorporate all reasonable comments timely provided by Parent on the
280G Documents. Prior to the Closing, the Company Group shall deliver to
Parent reasonably satisfactory evidence that a vote of the Company Group's
stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.4(f) and whether or not the requisite number of stockholder votes
consenting to such benefits and payments was obtained with respect to such
benefits and payments.

 

(g)Nothing set forth in this Section 6.4 shall (i) confer any rights or
remedies upon any employee or former employee of any member of the Company
Group (including, but not limited to, the Company Group Employees), or any
other Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Plans, or other
benefit program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) alter or limit Parent's or
the Surviving Corporation's or any of its Subsidiaries' ability to amend,
modify or terminate any specific benefit Plans, program, agreement or
arrangement at any time, or (iv) obligate Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(or any of their applicable Subsidiaries or Affiliates) to continue to employ
any Company Group Employee for any specific period of time following the
Closing Date, subject to applicable Law.

 

6.5.Indemnification of Directors and Officers

 

(a)From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue to fulfill and honor in all
respects the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
obligations of the Company Group to its directors, officers, managers,
employees, agents and other persons pursuant to any indemnification provisions
under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and similar organizational
documents of the Company Group as in effect on the date of this Agreement
(such Persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such provisions and all
other current and former directors, managers and officers of the Company
Group, collectively, the "DandO Indemnified Parties"). From and after the
Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain
the provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liability as set forth in the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws and similar organizational documents of the Company Group as of the
date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended,

   

repealed or otherwise modified during such period in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party.

 

(b)At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase (at its sole
expense) a prepaid directors' and officers' liability insurance or a tail
insurance policy covering those persons who are covered by the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
presently maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, that in no
event shall the Company be required to expend in any one (1) year an amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company Group for
such insurance.

 

(c)In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation or the transferee of such
properties and assets shall expressly assume and be responsible for all of the
obligations thereof as set forth in this Section 6.5.

 

(d)This Section 6.5 shall survive the Closing, is intended to benefit and may
be enforced by the DandO Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e)The Parties hereby acknowledge that certain of the DandO Indemnified Parties
(the "AEA DandO Parties") have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and/or insurance provided by the AEA Group. Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company (on its behalf and on behalf of the Company Group) hereby agree
that (i) after the Effective Time each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the AEA DandO
Parties are primary and any obligation of the AEA Group to advance expenses or
to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by
the AEA DandO Parties is secondary), (ii) after the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by the AEA DandO Parties and shall be liable for the full
amount of all losses to the extent legally permitted and as required by the
terms of this Section 6.5, without regard to any rights the AEA DandO Parties
may have against the AEA Group, and (iii) each of the Company (on its behalf
and on behalf of the Company Group), Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases the AEA Group from any and all claims against the
AEA Group for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect thereof.

 

6.6.Public Announcements

 

(a)The initial press release regarding this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions shall be made at such time and in such form as Parent, the
Company and the Equityholder Representative agree; provided that in the event
that such Parties cannot agree, either party shall be permitted to make any
disclosure required by Law or stock exchange rules or regulations. None of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Equityholder Representative, or the Company (or any of
their respective Affiliates) will issue or make any subsequent press release
or public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior consent of the other parties, except as may be
required by Law; provided, that the party proposing to issue any press release
or similar public announcement or communication in compliance with any such
disclosure obligations shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

   

consult in good faith with the other party before doing so. Notwithstanding
this Section 6.6(a), no such limitations will apply to the Equityholder
Representative and its Affiliates with respect to any communications with
their limited partners or prospective investors or prevent the AEA Group, the
Equityholder Representative and their Affiliates from disclosing information
about the Contemplated Transaction (other than valuation information) on their
websites in the Ordinary Course.

 

(b)Each of the Equityholder Representative, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall not be disclosed or
otherwise made available to the public and that copies of this Agreement shall
not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the public, except where
such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law or stock
exchange rules or regulations and only to the extent so required. In the event
that such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law or
stock exchange rules or regulations, each of the Equityholder Representative,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (as applicable) agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain "confidential treatment" of this
Agreement with the applicable Governmental Authority and to redact such terms
of this Agreement as any party to this Agreement shall reasonably request.

 

6.7.Use of Company Name

 

The Company hereby consents as of the Closing Date, to the AEA Group's use of
"BALBOA WATER GROUP, LLC," "SPA and BATH HOLDINGS, INC.," "HYDROAIR
INTERNATIONAL APS" and the other names and related marks and logos of the
Company Group (collectively, the "Company Name") on the AEA Group's printed
materials and website and in other forms and media (now existing and hereafter
developed) for the sole purpose of describing the prior ownership of, or the
AEA Group's former interest in, the Company Group. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained herein waives, restricts, or otherwise limits any rights
that the AEA Group may have under applicable Law or otherwise, including the
right to use the Company Name in a descriptive manner or for any nominative or
other fair use.

 

6.8.Mail; Payments

 

(a)After the Closing Date, Topco and the other Retained Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Parent, and its respective Affiliates (including the Company
Group), on the other hand, may receive mail, packages, or other communications
(including electronic communications) properly belonging to the other Person
(or the other Person's Affiliates or Subsidiaries, as applicable).
Accordingly, at all times after the Closing Date, each of Parent and Topco
authorizes the other and their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to
receive and open all mail, packages, and other communications received by them
and not unambiguously intended for the other Person (or its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) or any of the other Person's (or its Affiliates' or
Subsidiaries') officers or directors, and to retain the same to the extent
that they relate to the business of the Company Group (in the case of receipt
by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Group)) or the
Retained Subsidiaries (in the case of receipt by Topco, or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates), or to the extent that they do not relate to the
business of the Company Group (in the case of receipt by Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company Group)) or do not relate to the Retained
Subsidiaries (in the case of receipt by Topco or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates), the receiving Person shall promptly after becoming aware thereof
refer, forward, or otherwise deliver such mail, packages, or other
communications (or, in case the same relate to both the business of the
Company Group and the Retained Subsidiaries, copies thereof) to the other
applicable Person. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are not intended to, and
shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by either Topco (on behalf
of the Retained Subsidiaries)

   

or Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Group) to permit the
other to accept service of process on its behalf, and neither Person is or
shall be deemed to be the agent of the other for purposes of the service of
process.

 

(b)From and after the Closing, each of Parent and Topco shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, transfer and deliver to the other Person, from
time to time promptly after receipt thereof by it or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements, or other property
that it or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates receives which constitute,
(i) in the case of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company
Group), a payment incorrectly addressed or delivered to Topco, the Retained
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, including with respect to
any payment made under any agreement that is assigned to Topco or any Retained
Subsidiaries as part of the Reorganization Transactions, or (ii) in the case
of Topco, the Retained Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, a
payment incorrectly addressed or delivered to Parent, or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company Group), and each of Parent and Topco shall account to
the other Person for all such receipts.

 

6.9.Insurance

 

 Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that (a) all insurance policies
and insurance coverage maintained on behalf of the Company Group are part of
the corporate insurance program maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including the Retained Subsidiaries, and (b) from and after the
Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) cooperate with and
assist Topco and the Retained Subsidiaries in issuing notices of claims and
present claims for payment in so far as such claims related to the Retained
Subsidiaries arising out of or related to occurrences from prior to the
Closing under the occurrence-based insurance policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Retained Subsidiaries), (ii) direct any carriers
under such insurance policies to continue to make insurance coverage for such
claims available to Topco or the applicable Retained Subsidiary, and (iii)
facilitate the collection of insurance proceeds related thereto by directing
the applicable insurance carriers to pay any such proceeds to Topco or its
designee, or in the event any such proceeds are paid to the Company Group or
any of their Affiliates, pay such proceeds over to Topco or its designee.

 

6.10.Reorganization Transactions

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and
Topco shall take, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby consent to the taking of,
all actions reasonably necessary to effect the Reorganization Transactions
prior to the Closing, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree to reasonably
cooperate with the Company and Topco in connection with the consummation of
the Reorganization Transactions. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
confirm in writing to Parent that the Reorganization Transactions have been
consummated.

 

6.11.Topco Stock

 

So long as any obligation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement with respect
to the issuance by Topco of shares of Topco Stock remains outstanding, Topco
shall, at the applicable times, take all lawful action within its control to
cause the authorized capital stock of Topco to include a sufficient number of
authorized but unissued shares of each applicable class of Topco Stock to
satisfy its obligations hereunder. All shares of Topco Stock delivered
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be, when delivered, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and free and clear
of all Liens (other than any restrictions under applicable securities Laws or
pursuant to any stockholders' or similar agreement by stockholders of Topco).

   

6.12.Intercompany Arrangements

 

(a)Effective as of the Closing, any Indebtedness and all payables and
receivables between the Company Group or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any Equityholder, Topco or the Retained Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, if any, shall be settled in
full or otherwise discharged so that there is no further liability by any
party thereto to any other party thereto.

 

(b)Each Contract between the Company Group, on the one hand, and any
Equityholder, Topco or the Retained Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand (other than those Contracts entered into in
connection with the Reorganization Transactions and this Agreement and any
Ancillary Documents), if any, shall be terminated at or before the Closing
without further liability to the Company Group, Parent or Merger Sub.

 

6.13.Company Service Provider List

 

The Company shall update and deliver to Parent an updated Company Service
Provider List at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to
reflect any terminations and new hires and relocations permitted by or
consented to by Parent (if required) pursuant to Section 6.1(a).

 

6.14.Stockholder Approval

 

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Stockholder Approval promptly (but in any event no later than forty-eight (48)
hours from the date hereof) after the due execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

 

6.15.Exclusivity

 

From and after the date hereof and until the earlier of the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(a) discuss, encourage, negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend,
propose or enter into, whether as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or
acquired corporation or otherwise, any transaction involving a direct merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or other disposition of the
Company Group (or any portion thereof), the properties or assets of the
Company Group (other than disposition of immaterial assets in the Ordinary
Course) other than the Contemplated Transactions (an "Acquisition
Transaction"), (b) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Transaction, (c) furnish or cause to be furnished to any Person
any information concerning the business, operations, properties or assets of
the Company in connection with an Acquisition Transaction, or (d) otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or
encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the
foregoing with respect to the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Transaction.

 

6.16.Preservation of Books and Records

 

For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as
may be required by Law:

 

(a)Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries not to, dispose of or destroy any of the material books and
records (including Tax Returns, Business Records, files, data, reports,
manuals, and emails) of the Company Group as of the Closing Date relating to
periods prior to the Closing (the "Books and Records") without first offering
to turn over possession thereof to the Equityholder Representative (at the
Equityholder

   

Representative's expenses) by written notice to the Equityholder
Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date of such
disposition or destruction.

 

(b)Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to (in each case, at the expense of the Equityholder
Representative), (i) provide the Equityholder Representative and its agents
with electronic access to any portions of the Books and Records that are
available in electronic format, (ii) allow the Equityholder Representative and
its agents access to all other Books and Records on reasonable notice and at
reasonable times during normal business hours at Parent's principal place of
business or at any location where any Books and Records are stored, and permit
the Equityholder Representative and its agents, to make copies of any Books
and Records, in each case only to the extent necessary in anticipation of, or
preparation for, existing or future Litigation, Tax Proceeding, audit,
investigation or other matters in which the Equityholders, the Equityholder
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates are involved, and (iii)
make available Parent's or its Subsidiaries' personnel whose reasonable
assistance or participation (on reasonable prior notice and at reasonable
times during normal business hours) is reasonably required by the Equityholder
Representative in connection with the purposes described in this Section
6.16(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such access shall be permitted to
the extent it would, in Parent's reasonable opinion, (x) constitute a waiver
of the attorney-client privilege or other legal immunity or protection from
disclosure of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or their Affiliates, (y)
contravene applicable Law, Contract, or other obligation of confidentiality,
or (z) result in the disclosure of competitively sensitive information;
provided that the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the foregoing
restrictions apply.

The RandW Insurance Policy shall expressly provide that the insurer or insurers
issuing such policy shall have no right, and waive any right, of subrogation,
contribution, or otherwise against Topco or the Equityholders based upon,
arising out of, or in any way connected to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, except in the case of actual fraud by Topco or an Equityholder.
Topco and the Equityholders shall be intended third-party beneficiaries under
the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to the waiver of such insurer(s)'
rights. Following the date of this Agreement, Parent and its Affiliates shall
not amend, waive, modify or otherwise revise the subrogation provision in the
RandW Insurance Policy in any manner adverse to Topco or the Equityholders
without the written consent of the Equityholder Representative (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of
doubt, the costs, expenses, premiums or any other amounts with respect to the
RandW Insurance Policy shall be borne by Parent.

 

6.18.Efforts to Consummate

 

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and to applicable Law,
the Company and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Contemplated
Transactions, including the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set
forth in ARTICLE VII; provided, that such efforts shall not require the
Company to agree to any obligations or accommodations (financial or otherwise)
binding on the Company Group in the event the Closing does not occur. Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge that certain consents to the Contemplated
Transactions or waivers may be required from parties to Contracts to which

   

any member of the Company Group is a party (including the Contracts set forth
on Schedule 3.4) and such consents or waivers may not be obtained prior to the
Closing.

 

6.19.Intellectual Property

 

Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to effect the necessary corrective recordals to cause each item of
Intellectual Property required to be listed on Schedule 3.10(a)(i)-(iv) to be
recorded in the name of a member of the Company Group with each applicable
Governmental Authority.

 

6.20.Termination of Company 401(k) Plan

 

Effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, but
contingent on the occurrence of the Closing, the Company shall, and shall
cause each other applicable member of the Company Group to, pass board
resolutions to effect the termination of the Balboa Water Group, LLC 401(k)
Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") and deliver copies of such resolutions to
Parent. Each Company Group Employee that is a participant in the Company
401(k) Plan shall be permitted to participate, effective as of the Effective
Time, in a tax qualified plan which includes a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code that is
sponsored by Parent or an Affiliate thereof (the "Parent 401(k) Plan"). Parent
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, take all actions necessary so that the
Parent 401(k) Plan will accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) from the
Company 401(k) Plan (including rollover of any outstanding 401(k) loan
balances).

ARTICLE VIII 
Indemnification

 

8.1.Indemnification Obligations of Topco

 

From and after the Closing, Topco will indemnify and hold harmless Parent, its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Parent Indemnified Parties") from and against, and compensate, reimburse and
pay the Parent Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses to the extent
arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with:

 

(a)any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV;

 

(b)any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made in this Agreement
by (i) the Company, to the extent required by their terms to be performed at
or prior to the Closing, or (ii) Topco;

 

(c)the Reorganization Transactions;

   

(d)Taxes (and related costs and expenses, other than Parent's expenses
described in Section 10.2(f)(ii)) arising as a result of the Section 336(e)
Elections; and

 

(e)any matter set forth on Exhibit H.

 

The Losses of the Parent Indemnified Parties described in this Section 8.1 as
to which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are
collectively referred to as "Parent Losses".

 

8.2.Indemnification Obligations of Parent

 

From and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Equityholders, Topco, the Retained Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates
and their respective Representatives (collectively, the "Equityholder
Indemnified Parties") from and against, and compensate, reimburse and pay the
Equityholder Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses to the extent arising
out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with:

 

(a)any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
ARTICLE V; and

 

(b)any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made in this Agreement
by (i) Parent or Merger Sub, or (ii) the Company, to the extent required by
their terms to be performed after the Closing.

 

The Losses of the Equityholder Indemnified Parties described in this Section
8.2 as to which the Equityholder Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification are collectively referred to as "Equityholder Losses".

 

8.3.Indemnification Procedure

 

(a)Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice by a third
party (including any Governmental Authority) of any complaint, dispute or
claim or the commencement of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding
with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification pursuant hereto (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified
Party will provide written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (a "Third-
Party Notice of Claim"); provided, however, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will not limit the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII unless, and only to the extent that,
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying
Party will have the right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified
Party within twenty (20) days thereafter and provided the Indemnifying Party
simultaneously agrees in writing to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such
matter, to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the
payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel; provided, that if the
aggregate dollar amount of the Third-Party Claim, together with all other
Third-Party Claims of which the Indemnifying Party is aware or has received a
Third-Party Notice of Claim, and all costs and expenses reasonably estimated
to be incurred in connection with the defense thereof, would exceed the
monetary limitation hereunder of the indemnification obligation applicable to
such Third-Party Claim (the "Indemnification Cap"), the Indemnified Party may,
at its option, and to the extent in excess of the Indemnification Cap at its
sole cost and expense, assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim with
counsel of its choice. In the event, however, that the Indemnifying Party
declines or fails to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim on the terms
provided above within such

   

twenty (20)-day period, then any Parent Losses or Equityholder Losses (as the
case may be) will include the reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Indemnified Party as incurred; provided, that
the Indemnified Party shall not settle, adjust or compromise such matter, or
admit any liability with respect to such matter, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In any Third-Party Claim for which
indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, will have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own
counsel at such Person's own expense. The party assuming the defense of a
Third-Party Claim will use reasonable efforts to keep the other party
reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any matter the defense of
which it is maintaining and to cooperate with the other party with respect to
the defense of any such matter, and the Indemnified Party will make available
to the Indemnifying Party all material books, records and other documents and
materials that are under the direct or indirect control of the Indemnified
Party or any of the Indemnified Party's employees, agents, representatives or
advisors and that the counsel to the Indemnifying Party considers reasonably
necessary or desirable for the defense of such matter, and cooperate with, and
make its employees, agents, representatives and advisors reasonably available
upon prior written request or otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the
Indemnifying Party and its agents. With respect to any Third Party Claim, and
regardless of which Party is controlling the defense of such matter, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall also direct their counsel
to cooperate with one another and to share, as they deem appropriate,
attorney-client privileged communications and attorney work product, in each
case, subject to common interest protection, and to safeguard the other
Party's protected communications and information in the same way as they would
their own privileged communications and attorney work product. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 8.3(a), with respect to the
matters described in Section 8.1(c) (subject to Section 8.5(b)), Section
8.1(d), and Section 8.1(e), Topco or the Equityholder Representative (at such
Person's cost and expense) will assume and control the defense of such
matters.

 

(b)No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying
Party may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder
unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, employees and
Affiliates from all liability arising out of, resulting from or incurred in
connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not contain any admission or
statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified
Party or any of the Indemnified Party's Affiliates, (iii) does not contain any
equitable Order or term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes
with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iv)
involves only the payment of money, and such payment is made in full solely by
the Indemnifying Party without recourse to the Indemnified Party and (v) will
not limit the Indemnified Party's ability to make any claims or receive any
payments under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

(c)In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant hereto
with respect to any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim"), such Indemnified

   

Party will send written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party (a
"Notice of Claim"). Such Notice of Claim will specify the basis for such
Direct Claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will not limit the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification with respect to any Direct Claim made pursuant to this Section
8.3(c), provided that the Indemnifying Party is not materially prejudiced by
such failure to be so notified; provided, further, that Notices of Claim in
respect of a breach of a representation or warranty or breach of covenant must
be delivered prior to the expiration of the survival period for such
representation or warranty under Section 8.4. In the event the Indemnifying
Party has timely disputed the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
under this ARTICLE VIII or the amount thereof, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party will, as promptly as reasonably practicable, establish the
merits and amount of such Direct Claim (by mutual agreement, litigation or
otherwise).

 

8.4.Survival Period

 

The representations and warranties made by the Company, Topco, Parent and
Merger Sub herein will not be extinguished by the Closing, but will survive
the Closing until, and all claims for indemnification in connection therewith
must be asserted not later than, the date that is eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date. Any claims for breach of the covenants and other
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument or certificate
delivered by any party at the Closing, in each case which are required by
their terms to be performed prior to the Closing, will not survive and will be
extinguished at the Closing. Any claims for breach of the covenants and other
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument or certificate
delivered by any party at the Closing, in each case which contemplate
performance as of or after the Closing or that by their terms contemplate
performance after the Closing, shall survive until performed or otherwise in
accordance with their terms set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if, prior to the close of business on the last day a claim for indemnification
may be asserted hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will have been properly
notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim will not have been
finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim will continue to
survive and will remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is
finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

8.5.Liability Limitations

 

Notwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE VIII to the contrary:

 

(a)Solely with respect to any indemnification for Losses sought pursuant to
Section 8.1(a), the Parent Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to
indemnification until the aggregate amount of Parent Losses exceeds $928,625
(the "Deductible"); provided that, once such Parent Losses exceed the
Deductible, the Parent Indemnified Parties may seek recovery only for such
Parent Losses to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible, and no Parent
Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
8.1(a) to the extent that Parent Losses for which indemnification is sought
under this Agreement, individually or in the aggregate, exceed $928,625 (the
"Cap"); provided, however, that the limitations set forth in this Section
8.5(a) will not apply to any claim arising out of or related to actual fraud;
provided, further, that neither the Deductible, the Cap, nor any other
limitation set forth in this Agreement will limit any Parent Indemnified
Party's ability to make a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

(b)The maximum amount of indemnifiable Parent Losses that may be recovered by
the Parent Indemnified Parties from Topco with respect to all claims for
indemnification made pursuant to Section 8.1(c) shall not exceed $1,000,000.

   

(c)The maximum amount of indemnifiable Parent Losses that may be recovered by
the Parent Indemnified Parties from Topco pursuant to Section 8.1 for all
claims will not exceed the aggregate cash proceeds actually paid by Parent in
connection with this Agreement.

 

(d)Except for injunctive relief, and except in the case of actual fraud, the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent in respect of any and all rights and
claims for any breach of representation or warranty will be indemnification
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, which will be paid solely by release of funds
to Parent from the Indemnity Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

8.6.Materiality

 

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach of a representation or warranty
and the amount of Losses that are the subject matter of a claim for
indemnification or reimbursement hereunder, each representation and warranty
in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule will be read without regard and
without giving effect to the terms "material" or "Company Group Material
Adverse Effect" or similar phrases contained in such representation or
warranty which have the effect of making such representation and warranty less
restrictive (as if such word or qualification were deleted from such
representation and warranty).

 

8.7.Exclusive Remedy

 

The Parties agree that, excluding (a) actions grounded in actual fraud, and
(b) claims under the RandW Insurance Policy, the indemnities provided in this
ARTICLE VIII will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified
Party as to all Losses any Indemnified Party may incur arising out of,
resulting from or incurred in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document; provided, however, that this exclusive remedy for Losses does not
preclude a Party from bringing an action for specific performance or other
equitable remedy to require a Party to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document.

 

8.8.Indemnification Payments

 

(a)The Parent Indemnified Parties shall satisfy any claims under this ARTICLE
VIII first, from the Indemnity Escrow Account, second, from the RandW Insurance
Policy, and third, to the extent the RandW Insurance Policy or such other
insurance policies do not cover or satisfy such claims and if the Indemnity
Escrow Account has been fully exhausted or released, and subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, from Topco.

 

(b)Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall cooperate with each other
with respect to resolving any indemnification claims and minimizing Losses
with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party
hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or
minimize any such liability or Loss.

 

(c)The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
ARTICLE VIII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under insurance policies in effect and applicable to such Loss
(including the RandW Insurance Policy) except to the extent within the retention
or in excess of the limit of liability under the RandW Insurance Policy (in each
case, net of any costs of recovery or collection, premium adjustment, or
retrospectively-rated premium) or from any Person from any indemnity,
contribution or similar payment with respect to such Losses (provided, that if
the Indemnified Party actually receives insurance proceeds or any payment from
any such Person after payment to the Indemnified Party

   

of an indemnification payment hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for the aggregate amount of such
indemnification payment), and net of any Tax benefit reasonably anticipated to
be actually realized in the form of a refund or reduction in Taxes otherwise
by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with such Losses or
any of the circumstances giving rise thereto by the Indemnified Party for the
taxable period such Losses are incurred, as determined on a "with and without"
basis.

 

8.9.Release of Funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account

 

The portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
Account after all disbursements to the Parent Indemnified Parties, if any,
have been made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement (the "Indemnity Escrow Release Amount") will be distributed to the
Equityholder Representative, for further distribution to the Equityholders (in
the same manner of distribution as set forth in Section 10.1(e) with respect
to the Unused Equityholder Representative Expense Amount), on the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that funds
will not be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Equityholders to the extent
a claim made in good faith by any Parent Indemnified Parties for Losses that
is indemnifiable under this Agreement remains unresolved.

 

8.10.Avoiding Double Payments

 

Notwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE VIII to the contrary, no Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII
for any Losses to the extent such Losses were specifically treated as a
liability in determining the Closing Net Working Capital or Transaction
Expenses and actually deducted from the Closing Merger Cash Consideration Per
Share as part of the calculation of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement.

 

ARTICLE IX 
Termination

 

9.1.Termination Prior to Closing

 

This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing as follows:

 

(a)By the mutual written consent of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent,
on the other hand;

 

(b)By Parent at any time prior to the Closing, if (i) the Company or Topco is
in breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made by it in this
Agreement, (ii) such breach is not cured or capable of being cured by the
earlier of the day prior to the Termination Date and thirty (30) days
following written notice of such breach from Parent (to the extent such breach
is curable), and (iii) such breach, if not cured, would render the conditions
set forth in Section 7.3 incapable of being satisfied; provided, however, that
Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b) if Parent or Merger Sub has breached this Agreement and such
breach has resulted in the failure of a condition in Section 7.1 or Section
7.2 to be satisfied;

 

(c)By the Company at any time prior to the Closing, if (i) Parent or Merger
Sub is in breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made by it in
this Agreement, (ii) such breach is not cured or capable of being cured by the
earlier of the day prior to the Termination Date and thirty (30) days
following written notice of such breach from the Company (to the extent

   

such breach is curable) and (iii) such breach, if not cured, would render the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 incapable of being satisfied; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) if the Company or Topco has breached this
Agreement and such breach has resulted in the failure of a condition in
Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied;

 

(d)By the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if the
Closing shall not have occurred by December 31, 2020 (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that (i) the Company shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if the Company has breached
this Agreement and such breach has resulted in the failure of a condition in
Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied and (ii) Parent shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if Parent
or Merger Sub has breached this Agreement and such breach has resulted in the
failure of a condition in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 to be satisfied;

 

(e)By the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if (i) the
Contemplated Transactions shall violate any Order that shall have become final
and nonappealable or (ii) there shall be a Law which makes the Contemplated
Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited; provided, however, that the
Party seeking termination pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) is not then in
material breach of this Agreement; or

 

(f)By Parent, if, and only if, the Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained within forty-eight (48) hours following the execution of this
Agreement.

 

9.2.Effect of Termination

 

In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1
(other than in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(a)), written notice thereof shall be given by the terminating
Party to the other Parties and all rights, obligations and remedies of the
parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the rights,
obligations and remedies of the parties in this Section 9.2, Section 6.6, and
ARTICLE X and in the Confidentiality Agreement will survive; provided, that,
no such termination shall relieve a defaulting or breaching party from any
liability or damages arising out of its material breach of any provision of
this Agreement prior to such termination. The Company may, on behalf of the
Equityholders, petition a court to award damages in connection with any breach
by Parent or Merger Sub of the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. The Company may, additionally, on behalf of the Equityholders,
enforce such award and accept damages for such breach. In no event shall the
Company Group have any liability to any Equityholder as a result of any
termination of this Agreement, regardless of the reason for such termination.

 

ARTICLE X 
Miscellaneous

 

10.1.Equityholder Representative

 

(a)Each Letter of Transmittal shall provide that SBF II Representative Corp.
shall be the agent and attorney-in-fact for each of the Equityholders (in such
capacity, the "Equityholder Representative") to act as the Equityholder
Representative under this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents in accordance
with the terms of this Section 10.1 and the Ancillary Documents, and each
Letter of Transmittal shall provide that the Equityholder

   

Representative shall be the agent and attorney-in-fact for each of the
Equityholders as provided herein. In the event of the resignation of the
Equityholder Representative, a successor Equityholder Representative,
appointed by the resigning Equityholder Representative and reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, shall thereafter be appointed by an instrument in
writing signed by Parent and such successor Equityholder Representative.

 

(b)The Equityholder Representative is hereby (and each Letter of Transmittal
shall provide that the Equityholder Representative is) authorized and
empowered to act for, and on behalf of, any or all of the Equityholders (with
full power of substitution in the premises) in connection with (i) the
purchase price adjustment set forth in Section 2.8, and (ii) such other
matters as are reasonably necessary for the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions including (A) to receive or direct the receipt or distribution of
all payments owing to the Equityholders under this Agreement, (B) to withhold
any amounts received on behalf of the Equityholders in order to satisfy any
actual or potential liabilities of the Equityholders under this Agreement, (C)
to make any payments on behalf of the Equityholders and collect from the
Equityholders (in accordance with each Equityholder's Pro Rata Portion) any
amounts paid in settlement of any claims under this Agreement, (D) to
terminate, amend, waive any provision of, or abandon, this Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Documents, (E) to act as the representative of the Equityholders
to review and authorize all claims and disputes or question the accuracy
thereof, (F) to negotiate and compromise on their behalf with Parent any
claims asserted hereunder and to authorize payments to be made with respect
thereto, (G) to directly or indirectly distribute (or direct the distribution
of) any payments to Equityholders as contemplated by this Agreement, (H) to
take such further actions as are authorized in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents, and (I) in general, do all things and perform all acts, including
executing and delivering all agreements (including the Ancillary Documents),
certificates, receipts, consents, elections, instructions and other documents
contemplated by or deemed by the Equityholder Representative to be necessary
or desirable in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and
the Contemplated Transactions, and (iii) any claim for indemnification
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on
such appointment and to treat the Equityholder Representative as the duly
appointed attorney-in-fact of each Equityholder. Notices given to the
Equityholder Representative in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement shall constitute notice to the Equityholders for all purposes under
this Agreement. The Equityholder Representative shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Letters of Transmittal and the Ancillary Documents, and no implied covenants,
agreements, functions, duties, responsibilities, obligations or liabilities
shall be read into this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal, or the
Ancillary Documents or shall otherwise exist against the Equityholder
Representative.

 

(c)The appointment of the Equityholder Representative is an agency coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the Equityholder
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Section 10.1 shall be
effective and absolutely binding on each Equityholder notwithstanding any
contrary action of or direction from such Equityholder, except for actions or
omissions of the Equityholder Representative constituting actual fraud, and
the death or incapacity, or dissolution or other termination of existence, of
any Equityholder shall not terminate the authority and agency of the
Equityholder Representative, and each Letter of Transmittal shall provide for
the foregoing. Parent, Merger Sub and any other party to an Ancillary

   

Document in dealing with the Equityholder Representative may conclusively
rely, without inquiry, upon any act of the Equityholder Representative as the
act of the Equityholders.

 

(d)The Equityholder Representative shall be (and each Letter of Transmittal
shall provide that the Equityholder Representative shall be) released from,
and indemnified against, any liability for any action taken or not taken by
the Equityholder Representative in its capacity as such (including the
expenses referred to in Section 10.1(e)), except to the extent that the
Equityholder Representative is liable to any Equityholder for loss which such
Equityholder actually suffers resulting from or arising out of actual fraud or
willful misconduct on the part of the Equityholder Representative in carrying
out its duties hereunder. The Equityholder Representative shall not be (and
each Letter of Transmittal shall provide that the Equityholder Representative
shall not be) liable to any Equityholder or to any other Person, with respect
to any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Equityholder Representative
in its role as the Equityholder Representative under or in connection with
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, unless such action or omission
results from or arises out of actual fraud or willful misconduct on the part
of the Equityholder Representative, and the Equityholder Representative shall
not be liable to any Equityholder in the event that, in the exercise of its
reasonable judgment, the Equityholder Representative believes there will not
be adequate resources available to cover potential costs and expenses to
contest a claim made by Parent or Merger Sub against the Equityholders. Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Equityholder Representative is
party to this Agreement solely for purposes of serving as the "Equityholder
Representative" and that any covenant or agreement that requires performance
by the "Parties" or a "Party" at or prior to the Closing shall not be deemed
to require performance by the Equityholder Representative unless performance
by the Equityholder Representative is expressly provided for in such covenant
or agreement.

 

(e)The Equityholder Representative shall receive no compensation for service
as such but shall receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified from, the
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount, by the Equityholders, in
accordance with each Equityholder's Pro Rata Portion, for any and all
expenses, charges and liabilities, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees (collectively, the "Equityholder Representative Expenses"),
incurred by the Equityholder Representative in the performance or discharge of
its duties set forth in this Section 10.1. If the amount of the Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount is less than the Equityholder Representative
Expenses, each Equityholder shall pay (and shall agree in its respective
Letter of Transmittal to pay, or cause to be paid) to the Equityholder
Representative an amount equal to the product of (i) such Equityholder's Pro
Rata Portion, multiplied by (ii) the difference between (A) the Equityholder
Representative Expenses and (B) the Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount. Promptly following the determination by the Equityholder
Representative that all or any portion of the amount then remaining in the
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount is no longer needed to pay any the
Equityholder Representative Expenses, the Equityholder Representative shall
disburse, or cause to be disbursed through the Paying Agent, the amount of
such excess (the "Unused Equityholder Representative Expense Amount") as
follows:

 

(i)to each Stockholder, with respect to each share of Common Stock, in each
case outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by such
Stockholder for which a Letter of Transmittal has been properly delivered to
the Paying Agent, an amount equal

   

to the Unused Equityholder Representative Expense Amount Per Share (which
amounts may be deposited to the Exchange Fund for further distribution by the
Paying Agent);

 

(ii)to each holder of In-the-Cash Options, with respect to each share of Class
B Common Stock underlying each of such Optionholder's In-the-Cash Options (and
for which a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal has
been properly delivered to the Paying Agent), an amount equal to the Unused
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount Per Share (which amount, for the
avoidance of doubt, will be paid in cash and not in Topco Stock, and which
payment shall be effected by way of payment to the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries for payroll or other applicable payment processing by
the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and distribution at the
next administratively practicable payroll date to each such Optionholder); and

 

(iii)to each holder of In-the-Stock Options, with respect to each share of
Class B Common Stock underlying each such In-the-Stock Option (and for which a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal has been properly
delivered to the Paying Agent), a fraction of a share of Class B Topco Stock
(and not cash) having a value equal to the Unused Equityholder Representative
Expense Amount Per Share; provided that to the extent that after the delivery
of such shares of Topco Stock to the holders of In-the-Stock Options pursuant
to this Section 10.1(e)(iii) such Optionholder would have received, in respect
of one (1) In-the-Stock Option, more than one (1) share of Topco Stock, the
provisions of this Section 10.1(e)(iii) shall be revised in accordance with
Section 10.1(f).

 

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.1(e), if any Option
that was an In-the-Stock Option at the Closing becomes a Subsequent In-the-
Cash Option as a result of the distribution of the Unused Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount, then (x) the provisions of Section 10.1(e) (and
all applicable related definitions in this Agreement) shall be revised, and
(y) all calculations made in connection with Section 10.1(e) shall be adjusted
to take into account the effect of the additional In-the-Cash Options. Section
10.1(e) shall be applied with the effect that each Subsequent In-the-Cash
Option shall be entitled to receive the appropriate portion of the Aggregate
Merger Cash Consideration Per Share (as recalculated pursuant to this Section
10.1(f) taking into account the Unused Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount Per Share, if any) that is in excess of the per share exercise price of
such Subsequent In-the-Cash Option, it being understood that, applying this
Section 10.1(f) and after taking into account amounts previously received by
Stockholders and holders of In-the-Cash Options and In-the-Stock Options, the
payment of the Adjustment Escrow Release Amount Per Share, if any, may be
different for different Equityholders.

 

10.2.Tax Matters

 

(a)Transfer Taxes. Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Equityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders) or Topco, on the other hand,
shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
recording, registration and similar Taxes (including penalties and interest)
of any nature whatsoever ("Transfer Taxes"), applicable to, or resulting from,
the Contemplated Transactions. The Party primarily required by applicable Law
to do so shall file the necessary Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes and, if required by

   

applicable Law, the non-preparing Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

(b)Combined Tax Returns. The Equityholder Representative, at its or Topco's
expense, shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all combined, consolidated or
unitary Tax Returns that include any member of the Company Group, on the one
hand, and any Retained Subsidiaries, on the other hand, required to be filed
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period the due date of which (taking into account
valid extensions of time to file) is after the Closing Date ("Combined Tax
Returns"), but only if such Tax Return has not been filed by the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns that are Income Tax Returns
shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with the past practice of
the Company Group; provided that, such Income Tax Returns shall include all
Transaction Tax Deductions to the extent that the reporting of such items in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period has "substantial authority" as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6662-4(d). The Equityholder Representative shall provide
Parent, not less than thirty (30) days prior to filing, with copies of each
Income Tax Return prepared pursuant to this Section 10.2(b) for Parent's
review and comment, and shall incorporate any reasonable revisions thereto
requested in writing by Parent. If, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of
requested revisions, the Equityholder Representative notifies Parent in
writing that it objects to one or more such requested revisions, the
Equityholder Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute (and if no such written notification is provided within
such time period, the Equityholder Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted such requested revisions as final). If the Equityholder
Representative and Parent fail to resolve any such dispute within five (5)
days of the Equityholder Representative's receipt of Parent's notice, then the
Equityholder Representative and Parent shall submit the items in dispute for
resolution to the Accounting Arbitrator, which shall, as soon as practicable
after such submission, determine (and report to the Equityholder
Representative and Parent its resolution regarding) whether Parent's comment
in dispute is reasonable. The resolution of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto. The fees for the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Stockholders, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand. Parent shall timely file (or cause to be timely
filed) all Combined Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this Section 10.2(b), and
Topco shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of Taxes shown as due thereon
to Parent (or, in the case of any Taxes for a Straddle Period, the amount of
such Taxes allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date pursuant to Section 10.2(g)) no later than five (5) days prior to
the due date of such Taxes, except to the extent such amount is taken into
account as a Transaction Expense or included as a liability in Final Closing
Net Working Capital.

 

(c)Separate Tax Returns. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed, any
Tax Return that includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company Group that is
not a Combined Tax Return the due date of which (taking into account valid
extensions of time to file) is after the Closing Date, but only if such Tax
Return has not been filed by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date.
Parent shall provide the Equityholder Representative, not less than thirty
(30) days prior to filing, with copies of each Income Tax Return prepared by
Parent pursuant to this Section 10.2(c) for the Equityholder Representative's
review and comment, and shall incorporate any reasonable revisions thereto
requested in writing by the Equityholder Representative. If, within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of requested revisions, Parent notifies the Equityholder
Representative in writing that it objects to one or more such requested
revisions, Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall negotiate

   

in good faith to resolve such dispute (and if no such written notification is
provided within such time period, Parent shall be deemed to have accepted such
requested revisions as final). If Parent and the Equityholder Representative
fail to resolve any such dispute within five (5) days of the Parent's receipt
of the Equityholder Representative's notice, then the Equityholder
Representative and Parent shall submit the items in dispute for resolution to
the Accounting Arbitrator, which shall, as soon as practicable after such
submission, determine (and report to the Equityholder Representative and
Parent its resolution regarding) whether Parent's comment in dispute is
reasonable. The resolution of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and
binding upon the parties hereto. The fees for the Accounting Arbitrator shall
be borne equally by the Equityholder Representative, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand. The Equityholder Representative shall prepare and
timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed, any Tax Returns
of the Retained Subsidiaries the due date of which (taking into account valid
extensions of time to file) is after the Closing Date, but only if such Tax
Return has not been filed by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date.
Each Party responsible for the preparation of a Tax Return under this Section
10.2(c) shall timely remit, or cause to be timely remitted, all Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns; provided that with respect to any such Tax Return
of the Company Group, Topco shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of Taxes
shown as due thereon to Parent (or, in the case of any Taxes for a Straddle
Period, the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 10.2(g)) no later than
five (5) days prior to the due date of such Taxes, except to the extent such
amount is taken into account as a Transaction Expense or included as a
liability in Final Closing Net Working Capital. All Tax Returns prepared
pursuant to this Section 10.2(c) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practices, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(d)Parent Consolidated Group. Parent shall cause the Company Group to join
Parent's "consolidated group" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-1(h)) effective on the day immediately after the Closing Date. The
Parties shall, to the extent permitted or required under applicable Law, treat
the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period of the Company Group
for all U.S. federal income Tax and state and local 
Tax purposes. The Parties agree that, following the Closing, Parent and its
Affiliates and the Company Group (i) shall not make an election under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to ratably allocate items (or any
make any similar election or ratably allocate items under any corresponding
provision of state, local or foreign Law), and (ii) shall not apply the "next
day" rule of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect
to any available Tax deductions for the Transaction Expenses.

 

(e)Parent Tax Actions. Following the Closing, neither Parent nor any member
of the Company Group shall, (i) except as required by applicable Law, change
any method of accounting or Tax reporting position for a member of the Company
Group with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) file any administrative
adjustment request (or state or local equivalent) or amended Tax Return with
respect any member of the Company Group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii)
make any Tax election with respect to any member of the Company Group that has
retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) initiate or pursue the
process for entering into a "voluntary disclosure agreement" (or comparable
arrangement) with a Governmental Authority with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period of any member of the Company Group, (v) after the Closing, take any
action outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date, other than
any action related to the Contemplated Transactions, or (vi) agree to extend
or waive the statute of

   

limitations with respect to Taxes of any member of the Company Group for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, without the Equityholder
Representative's prior written approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 

(f)Control of Tax Proceedings. 

 

(i)Following the Closing, in the case of any Tax audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding (a "Tax Proceeding") of or with respect to any of the
Company or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries that relates to a Combined Tax
Return (a "Combined Tax Proceeding"), other than as provided in Section
10.2(f)(ii), Parent shall have the right and obligation to conduct, at its own
expense, such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that if such Tax Proceeding
relates directly to items of the Retained Subsidiaries or if the resolution of
would be expected to have an adverse impact on the Retained Subsidiaries or
give rise to an indemnification obligation by Topco, (i) Parent shall keep the
Equityholder Representative apprised of material developments with respect to,
and shall promptly respond to any reasonable requests from the Equityholder
Representative for information relating to, such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the
Equityholder Representative, at its or Topco's own expense, shall be permitted
to participate in such Tax Proceeding, and (iii) Parent shall not settle,
compromise, or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Equityholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, if such settlement, compromise
or abandonment could have a material adverse impact on the Retained
Subsidiaries or give rise to an indemnification obligation by the
Equityholders.

 

(ii)Following the Closing, in the case of any Tax Proceeding primarily related
to the Section 336(e) Elections, the Equityholder Representative shall have
the right to conduct, at its or Topco's own expense, such Tax Proceeding;
provided, however, that (i) the Equityholder Representative shall keep Parent
apprised of material developments with respect to, and shall promptly respond
to any reasonable requests from Parent for information relating to, such Tax
Proceeding, (ii) Parent, at its own expense, shall be permitted to participate
in such Tax Proceeding and (iii) the Equityholder Representative shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. If the Equityholder Representative declines
to control such Tax Proceeding in accordance with the preceding sentence,
Parent shall control such Tax Proceeding, subject to the proviso contained in
Section 10.2(f)(i).

 

(iii)To the extent any Combined Tax Proceeding results in an adjustment to
items of the Retained Subsidiaries and such adjustment results in a cash Tax
liability to Parent, Topco shall pay an amount equal to such cash Tax
liability to Parent within thirty (30) days of a final determination. To the
extent any Combined Tax Proceeding results in an adjustment to items of the
Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries, Parent shall pay for such Taxes, except
to the extent covered by the indemnification provisions of ARTICLE VIII
(including any Taxes arising from the Reorganization Transactions (up to the
limit set forth in Section 8.5(b) or from the Section 336(e) Elections).
Following the Closing, Parent shall control all other Tax Proceedings for the
Company Group (and any member thereof) and shall pay any Taxes arising as a
result of such Tax Proceedings, except to the extent covered by the
indemnification provisions of ARTICLE VIII. The Equityholder Representative
shall control all other Tax Proceedings for the Retained Subsidiaries (or any
member thereof), and Topco shall pay any Taxes arising as a

   

result of such Tax Proceedings. The provisions of this Section 10.2(f), and
not the provisions of Section 8.3, shall govern the conduct of any and all Tax
Proceedings.

 

(g)Straddle Periods. Taxes for any Straddle Period shall be allocated as
follows: (i) in the case of Taxes based on capitalization, debt or shares of
stock authorized, issued or outstanding or real property, ad valorem Taxes and
other periodic Taxes, the portion of such Taxes allocated to the period ending
on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Tax period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and
(ii) in the case of any other Tax, the portion of such Taxes allocated to the
period ending on the Closing Date will be determined on the basis of an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that (1) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned
on a daily basis and (2) Taxes attributable to any amount required to be
included by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including any member of the
Company Group after the Closing) under Section 951 or Section 951A of the Code
shall be allocated to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date to the extent such Taxes (A) are attributable to the income, earnings and
profits or property of HydroAir International ApS or any other member of the
Company Group that is a "controlled foreign corporation" within the meaning of
Section 957(a) of the Code and (B) would be allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period if the taxable year of HydroAir International ApS or any other member
of the Company Group that is a "controlled foreign corporation" within the
meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code ended on the Closing Date (determined on
a "with and without" basis).

 

(h)Tax Treatment. The Parties agree that (1) the fair market value of the
capital stock of Topco and the equity interests of each Retained Subsidiary
listed on Schedule 10.2(h) as of the Closing will be equal to the applicable
values set forth on Schedule 10.2(h) (the "Retained Business Values"), (2) the
Tax treatment of the Reorganization Transaction shall be as described in
Exhibit D, and (3) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (A) a portion of the
Common Stock shall be treated as having been exchanged for shares of capital
stock of Topco in a redemption under Section 302(a) of the Code (and not as a
distribution of property governed by Section 301 of the Code) and integrated
with the Merger pursuant to Zenz v. Quinlivan, 213 F.2D 917 (6th Cir. 1954),
and (B) the other shares of Common Stock shall be treated as having been
exchanged for all other Aggregate Merger Cash Consideration Per Share in a
purchase of such Common Stock by Parent. No Party shall take any position that
is inconsistent with the treatment set forth in this Section 10.2(h) for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, or where permissible, state or local Tax
purposes.

 

(i)Section 336(e) Election.

 

(i)The Company, Topco, and each Retained Subsidiary (other than Control
Solutions, Inc., BWG Holdings CA Inc., 567834 Ontario Inc., and 2307623
Ontario Inc.) shall join in making elections under Section 336(e) of the Code
(and any similar election under state or local law) in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.336-2(h) (and any applicable provisions of
state and local law) to treat the transfers of Topco and each such Retained
Subsidiary in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby as a
purchase of assets from an unrelated party for fair market value (the "Section
336(e) Elections"), and shall cooperate in the timely

   

completion and/or filings of such elections and any related filings or
procedures. This Section 10.2(i)(i) is intended to constitute a binding,
written agreement to make an election under Section 336(e) of the Code and
Treasury Regulation Section 1.336-2(h)(1)(i) with respect to the transfers of
Topco and each such Retained Subsidiary in connection with the Contemplated
Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, no election under Section 336(e) of
the Code shall be made with respect to Control Solutions, Inc., BWG Holdings
CA Inc., or 567834 Ontario Inc. No Party shall take any position on any Tax
Return or in any Tax Proceeding that is inconsistent with the Section 336(e)
Elections.

 

(ii)In connection with the Section 336(e) Elections, Topco shall (i) determine
the "Aggregate Deemed Asset Disposition Price" and the "Adjusted Grossed-Up
Basis" (each as defined under applicable Treasury Regulations) and the
allocation of such Aggregate Deemed Asset Disposition Price and Adjusted
Grossed-Up Basis among the assets of the applicable Retained Subsidiaries,
each in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 336(e) of the
Code and applicable Treasury Regulations (the "Section 336(e) Allocation
Statement"), and (ii) deliver such Section 336(e) Allocation Statement to
Parent for Parent's review and comment within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date. The Section 336(e) Allocation Statement shall be consistent with
the Retained Business Values described on Schedule 10.2(h). Topco shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments to the Section 336(e)
Allocation Statement provided by Parent. No Party shall take any position that
is inconsistent with the Section 336(e) Allocation Statement for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, or where permissible, state or local Tax purposes.

 

(iii)In connection with the Section 336(e) Election with respect to Topco,
Parent shall make an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii) in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii)(E) and specifying Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii)(C) as the basis for such election.

 

(j)Basis Study and State Tax Analysis. Topco and the Equityholder
Representative will engage a Big 4 accounting firm to perform a stock basis
study of Topco and the Retained Subsidiaries and an asset basis study of Topco
and the Retained Subsidiaries (other than Control Solutions, Inc., BWG
Holdings CA Inc., 567834 Ontario Inc., and 2307623 Ontario Inc.) and a
calculation of the estimated state Tax effects of the Reorganization
Transactions and the Section 336(e) Elections (the "Restructuring Tax
Analysis"). Topco and the Equityholder Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to complete and to deliver in draft form the Restructuring
Tax Analysis to Parent no later than thirty (30) days after execution of this
Agreement using reasonable assumptions. Topco and the Equityholder
Representative will cause the Restructuring Tax Analysis to be updated and
finalized no later than sixty (60) days prior to the due date of the federal
and state income Tax Returns that reflect the Reorganization Transactions and
the Section 336(e) Elections.

 

(k)Cooperation. Each of the Parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other
and shall provide each other with such assistance as may be and to the extent
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns (including any information required to be reported by Parent pursuant
to Section 6043A of the Code) and any audit, proceeding or other Litigation
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
a Party or

   

the Equityholder Representative's request, as applicable) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
proceeding or other Litigation.

 

(l)In the event the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to receive
any refund of Taxes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any refund of
overpayments of estimated Taxes) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Parent shall cause the Company or any such Subsidiary to promptly pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Equityholder Representative (or
as directed by the Equityholder Representative, to the Paying Agent, or to a
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any amounts payable to
Company Group Employees for payroll or other applicable payment processing by
the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary), for further
distribution to the Equityholders (in the same manner of distribution as set
forth in Section 10.1(e) with respect to the Unused Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount), an amount in cash equal to such refund plus
any interest earned with respect to such refund (net of any tax imposed in
connection with such refund and the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Parent in obtaining and paying over such refunds); provided that such refund
of Taxes was not reflected in Closing Net Working Capital and; provided
further, that such refund is not attributable to the carryback of any Tax item
or Tax attribute from a Tax period beginning after the Closing. Any refunds or
credits of or against Taxes of the Company for any Straddle Period shall be
equitably apportioned between the Equityholders and Parent in accordance with
the principles set forth in Section 10.2(g). In addition, Parent will pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Equityholder Representative (or as directed by the
Equityholder Representative, to the Paying Agent, or to a Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation with respect to any amounts payable to Company Group
Employees for payroll or other applicable payment processing by the Surviving
Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary) for further distribution to the
Equityholders (in the same manner of distribution as set forth in Section
10.1(e) with respect to the Unused Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount), an amount equal to any Realized Tax Benefit actually realized by
Parent, the Company Group, or any of their respective Affiliates in any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before December 31, 2023 within ten
(10) Business Days of the filing of the Tax Return for the Tax period in which
such benefit is realized; provided, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall entitle the Equityholder Representative, any Equityholder or any other
Person to review any Tax Return of Parent (including any Tax Return of a
consolidated group of which Parent is a member) for any taxable period or any
Tax Return of the Company Group for any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date.

 

10.3.Expenses

 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, including Section
6.3, Section 10.1, and Section 10.2, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are
consummated.

10.5.Governing Law

 

All matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and
enforcement of this Agreement, including all claims or disputes (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
(including any claim or cause or action based upon, arising out of, or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or

   

rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware, including statutes of limitation.

 

10.6.Entire Agreement

 

This Agreement, together with the exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule,
the Ancillary Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the
entire understanding and agreement of the Parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior contracts or agreements
among the Parties, whether oral or written.

 

10.7.Severability

 

Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
Person or circumstance be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any
extent: (a) such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, and only to the
extent, of such unenforceability, illegality or prohibition and shall be
enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Law, (b) such unenforceability,
illegality, or prohibition in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision as applied (i) to other Persons or circumstances,
or (ii) in any other jurisdiction, and (c) such unenforceability, illegality
or prohibition shall not affect or invalidate any other provision of this
Agreement.

 

10.8.Amendment

 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may be amended,
supplemented or modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed
by the Parties; provided that the observance of any provision of this
Agreement may be waived in writing by the Party that will lose the benefit of
such provision as a result of such waiver.

 

10.9.Effect of Waiver or Consent

 

No waiver or consent, express or implied, by any Party to or of any breach or
default by any Party in the performance by such Party of its obligations
hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any
other breach or default in the performance by such Party of the same or any
other obligations of such Party hereunder. No single or partial exercise of
any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. Failure on the part of a Party to
complain of any act of any Party or to declare any Party in default,
irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver
by such Party of its rights hereunder until the applicable statute of
limitation period has run.

 

10.10.Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others

 

Certain provisions of this Agreement are intended for the benefit of the
Equityholders and shall be enforceable by the Equityholder Representative on
behalf of the Equityholders; provided, that no Equityholder shall have the
right to directly take any action or enforce any provision of this Agreement,
it being understood and agreed that all such actions shall be taken solely by
the Equityholder Representative on behalf of the Equityholders as provided in
Section 10.1. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to
the benefit of, the Parties and their respective legal representatives,
successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing
in this Agreement shall be construed to give any Person (other than the
Parties and their respective legal representatives, successors and permitted
assigns and as expressly provided herein) any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or
provisions contained herein, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise;
provided, that (a) the Equityholder Representative shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to enforce any rights of the Company or the Equityholders
under this Agreement (including the right of the

   

Equityholders to pursue damages in the event of Parent's or Merger Sub's
breach of this Agreement), (b) the Persons released pursuant to Section 10.20
shall have the right to enforce their respective rights under Section 10.20,
(c) from and after the Closing, the DandO Indemnified Parties shall be third
party beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 6.5, with the right to pursue
claims for damages and other relief (including specific performance or other
equitable relief) in the event of any breach thereof, and (d) the AEA Group,
the Retained Subsidiaries (to the extent not party to this Agreement), and
Fried Frank shall have the right to enforce their respective rights under
Section 10.19.

 

10.11.Assignability

 

No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may
be made by any party, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto and
any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void; provided
that (a) the Equityholder Representative may, at its election appoint a
successor Equityholder Representative in accordance with Section 10.1, (b)
Parent and, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation may assign their
respective rights (but not their obligations) hereunder without the prior
written consent of, but with written notice to, the Equityholder
Representative to any of their respective Affiliates, and (c) following the
Closing, Topco may assign its rights and obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of, but with written notice to, Parent, to any of its
Affiliates; provided that such assignment will not relieve Topco of any
liability under this Agreement.

 

10.12.Disclosure Schedule

 

The Disclosure Schedule has been arranged, for purposes of convenience only,
in schedules numbered to correspond to the Sections of this Agreement. For the
purposes of this Agreement, any information and/or matter disclosed in a
schedule in the Disclosure Schedule that is numbered to correspond to a
particular section of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to such section of the Agreement (whether or not a Disclosure
Schedule is referenced in such section) and any other section of this
Agreement to the extent the applicability thereto is reasonably apparent on
its face or where noted with applicable cross-references. No reference to or
disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is
material (nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose
whatsoever) or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule. The information set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement,
and no information set forth therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any
party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including any
violation of Law or breach of any Contract. The Disclosure Schedule and the
information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and
limit the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company Group
contained in this Agreement. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or create any covenant. Matters reflected in the Disclosure
Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to
be reflected in the Disclosure Schedule. In disclosing the information in the
Disclosure Schedule, the Company (on behalf of itself and the other members of
the Company Group) expressly does not waive any attorney-client privilege
associated with such information or any protection afforded by the work-
product doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed
herein. References to any document contained in the Disclosure

   

Schedule are not intended to summarize or describe such document, but rather
are for convenience only and reference should be made to such document for
full explanation thereof.

 

10.13.Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial

 

Any Litigation involving any party to this Agreement arising out of or in any
way relating to this Agreement, including all disputes (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, shall be
brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (unless
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, in which case, in any state or federal court within
the State of Delaware) (together with the appellate courts thereof, the
"Chosen Courts") and each of the Parties hereby submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for the purpose of any such Litigation. Each
Party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (a) any objection
which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such Litigation in any
Chosen Court, (b) any claim that any such Litigation brought in any Chosen
Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (c) any claim that any
Chosen Court does not have personal jurisdiction over any party with respect
to such Litigation. To the extent that service of process by mail is permitted
by applicable Law, each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process
in any such Litigation in such courts by the mailing of such process by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for notices
provided for herein. The Parties agree that any judgment entered by any Chosen
Court may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right to a trial by
jury and agrees that any of them may file a copy of this paragraph with any
court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained-for
agreement among the Parties irrevocably to waive its right to trial by jury in
any Litigation.

 

10.14.Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors

 

Each Party has consulted such legal, financial, technical or other expert as
it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this Agreement. Each
Party represents and warrants that it has read, knows, understands and agrees
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

10.15.Remedies

 

All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded to
the Parties hereunder, shall be cumulative and not alternative, and any Person
having any rights under any provision of this Agreement will be entitled to
enforce such rights specifically, to recover damages by reason of any breach
of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by Law, equity or
otherwise.

 

10.16.Specific Performance

 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage could occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree
that, in addition to any other remedies, each Party shall be entitled to seek
enforcement of the terms of this Agreement (including a Party's obligation to
consummate the Closing) by a decree of specific performance without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Each Party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or other
security in connection with such remedy. Each Party further agrees that the
only permitted objection that it

   

may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests
the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

 

10.17.Counterparts

 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including
counterparts transmitted via facsimile or in .pdf or similar format) with the
same effect as if all signatory Parties had signed the same document. All
counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 

10.18.Further Assurance

 

If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable
to fully effect the Contemplated Transactions, each of Topco, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall take such further action (including the execution
and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other party
reasonably may request.

 

10.19.Legal Representation

 

(a)Each of the Parties acknowledges that Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and
Jacobson LLP ("Fried Frank") currently serves as counsel to (i) the Company
Group, (ii) the Retained Subsidiaries, and (iii) the AEA Group, including in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, and that Fried Frank intends to act as legal counsel to the AEA
Group and the Retained Subsidiaries after the Closing. Parent and Merger Sub,
on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waive, and
after the Closing, will cause the Company Group to waive, any conflicts that
may arise in connection with Fried Frank representing the AEA Group and the
Retained Subsidiaries after the Closing even if such representation may relate
to the Contemplated Transactions or to any matter substantially related to
Fried Frank's prior representation of the Company Group.

 

(b)Each of the Parties further agrees that all communications and documents
exchanged in any form or format whatsoever between Fried Frank, on the one
hand, and any of the Company Group, the Retained Subsidiaries, and/or the AEA
Group (or any other Equityholder), or any of their respective Affiliates, on
the other hand, relating to the consideration, negotiation, documentation, and
consummation of the Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents, or the
Contemplated Transactions or any alternative acquisition transaction
(collectively, the "Deal Communications"), shall be deemed to be retained and
owned solely by the AEA Group, shall be controlled solely by the AEA Group,
and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company Group,
or any of their Affiliates. All Deal Communications that are subject to the
attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine or any other
privilege or protection (collectively, the "Privileged Deal Communications")
shall remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the
AEA Group, shall be controlled solely by AEA Group, and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company Group, or any of their
Affiliates. None of the AEA Group, the Retained Subsidiaries, nor Fried Frank
shall have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any Deal Communications,
Privileged Deal Communications, or files to the Company Group by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Fried Frank and the Company Group or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Parent or the Company Group, on the one hand, and a
third party other than the AEA Group, any other Equityholder, the Retained
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Parent
and the Company Group may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;

   

provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Company Group may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Equityholder
Representative. In the event that Parent or the Company Group is legally
required by Order to produce any Deal Communications or Privileged Deal
Communications in their possession, Parent shall promptly (and, in any event,
within two (2) Business Days) notify the Equityholder Representative in
writing (including by making specific reference to this section) so that the
Equityholder Representative can seek a protective order or take other
appropriate action and Parent and the Company Group agree to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

 

(c)To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Fried Frank
constitute property of its clients, only the Equityholder Representative shall
hold such property rights with respect to any representation prior to the
Closing of the Company Group, and Fried Frank shall have no duty to reveal or
disclose any such files or other materials by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Fried Frank, on the one hand, and the Company Group, on
the other hand.

 

(d)Prior to the Closing, the Equityholder Representative, the Company Group,
the Retained Subsidiaries, or the AEA Group (or any other Equityholder), or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, or other
representatives, are permitted to take any action to protect from access or
remove from the premises of the Company Group (or any offsite back-up or other
facilities) any Privileged Deal Communications, including by segregating,
encrypting, copying, deleting, erasing, exporting, or otherwise taking
possession of any Privileged Deal Communications (any such action, a
"Permitted Removal"). However, it may not be practicable or cost-effective to
undertake a Permitted Removal, or to remove all Privileged Deal Communications
that may exist in the Company Group's files and electronic servers and
databases. In the event that any Privileged Deal Communications (including
any copy, backup, image, or other form, version, or electronic vestige of such
material) remains accessible to or discoverable or retrievable by Parent,
Merger Sub, or the Company Group (each, a "Residual Communication"), Parent
and Merger Sub, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, consent and
agree, and agree to cause the Company Group (after the Closing) to consent and
agree, that they will not intentionally use, or attempt to use, any means to
access, retrieve, restore, recreate, unarchive, or otherwise gain access to or
view any Residual Communication for any purpose. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
successors, or assigns, agree (i) not to assert that the privilege has been
waived as to the Privileged Deal Communications or the subject matter of such
material that may be located in the records electronic servers and databases
(or in the knowledge of the officers and employees) of the Company Group or
the Surviving Corporation; and (ii) not to assert that Parent, Merger Sub, or
the Company Group have the right to waive the attorney-client or other
privilege with respect to such material or the subject matter contained in it.

 

(e)This Section 10.19 is for the benefit of the AEA Group (and any other
Equityholder), the Retained Subsidiaries, and Fried Frank, and the AEA Group,
the Retained Subsidiaries (to the extent not party hereto), and Fried Frank
are express third party beneficiaries of this Section 10.19. This Section
10.19 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 10.19 may be amended,
waived, or modified, without the prior written consent of the Equityholder
Representative and Fried Frank.

   

10.20.Release

 

Except in the case of actual fraud, effective as of the Effective Time, each

covenant, undertaking or other agreement contained in this Agreement, the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto or in any certificate contemplated hereby and
delivered in connection herewith, (d) any information (whether written or
oral), documents or materials furnished in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, or (e) any COVID Action taken prior to the Closing; provided
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall release, waive, discharge,
relinquish or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any Person with
respect to enforcing the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and its
successors and assigns hereby waive, and unconditionally release the
Equityholders of the Company from, any rights and remedies that Parent, the
Company Group, and its successors and assigns may otherwise have against such

Liability Act, or common law.

 

10.21.No Recourse Against Nonparty Affiliates

statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and are those solely of) the
entities that are expressly identified as Parties in the preamble to this
Agreement ("Contracting Parties"). Except for the Company's right to enforce
the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms, no Person who is
not a Contracting Party, including any director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, unitholder, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, or representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to,
any Contracting Party, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, unitholder, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
or representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the
foregoing ("Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity,

   

or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to, this Agreement, or based on, in respect of, or by reason of, this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach; and, to the
maximum extent permitted by law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations
against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, and
excluding the Company's right to enforce the Confidentiality Agreement in
accordance with its terms, to the maximum extent permitted by law, (a) each
Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims,
demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in
equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a
Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on any
Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity,
agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business
enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise,
and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty
Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement.
