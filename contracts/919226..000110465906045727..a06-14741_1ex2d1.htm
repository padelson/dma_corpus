Closing Balance Sheet;

  

(ix) any obligation and liability in respect of Indebtedness of the Sellers

liability or responsibility for any of the debts, obligations or
liabilities arising therefrom.

  

### (e) This _Section 2.07_ is not intended to and shall not benefit any
Person other than the Sellers and the Purchaser.

  

2.08 _Sales and Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall
split equally the cost of (a) any real property transfer or similar tax
imposed by any Governmental Authority which arises out of the transfer of the
Real Property (" _Real Property Transfer Taxes_ ") other than goods and
services tax or sales tax for which the Purchaser fully receives
corresponding tax credits; and (b) all other transfer, sales, purchase, use,
value added, excise or similar taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority
which arise out of the transfer of any of the other Purchased Assets ("
_Other Transfer Taxes_ ") other than goods and services tax or sales tax for
which the Purchaser receives corresponding tax credits. To the extent either
the Seller or the Purchaser incurs any Real Property Transfer Taxes or Other
Transfer Taxes in transferring the Purchased Assets from the Sellers to the
Purchaser under this Agreement, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Sellers, or
the Sellers shall reimburse the Purchaser, as applicable, **** for the
applicable portion of such amounts. SSCE and Smurfit Canada, as applicable,
shall, each at its own expense, file all necessary Tax returns and other

Transfer Taxes required by applicable Law, and Purchaser, if required by
applicable Law, will prepare or join in the execution of any such Tax returns
and other documentation.

  

2.09 _Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax Election_. The

provision under any applicable provincial or territorial legislation imposing
a similar value added or multi-staged tax, that no tax be payable with
respect to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets under this
Agreement. The Purchaser, or its Affiliate, and Smurfit Canada shall make
such election(s) in prescribed form containing prescribed information and the
Purchaser, or its Affiliate, shall file such election(s) in compliance with
the requirements of the applicable legislation.

  

2.10 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

     

   

### (a) Within sixty (60) days after the Settlement Date, the Purchaser shall
provide a schedule to the Sellers allocating the Purchase Price (and all
relevant Assumed Liabilities) (the " _Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_ ")
among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Code section 1060. Such
allocation will be based on an appraisal to be performed by an independent,
licensed appraiser selected and paid for solely by the Purchaser. The Sellers
shall have thirty (30) days to review and approve or dispute the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld). If the Sellers dispute any portion of the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule within such thirty (30) day period, the parties
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute. To the extent the
parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the dispute, shall be resolved in
accordance with the dispute resolution mechanics set forth in _Section
2.05(d) _( _mutatis mutandis_ ). Each party hereto agrees for all Tax
reporting purposes (including for purposes of filing of an IRS Form 8594) to
report the transactions consistently with the allocation set forth on the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as agreed upon by the Sellers or
otherwise resolved in accordance with this _Section 2.10_). The parties
hereto shall make appropriate adjustments to the allocations on the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule to reflect any adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  

### (b) The Sellers and the Purchaser agree that the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with Brampton
Plant Appraisal (as defined below) and that the amount set forth on the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule with respect to the Brampton Plant shall
constitute the portion of the Purchase Price (after being reduced to reflect
any Assumed Liabilities which are liabilities of Smurfit Canada) paid to
Smurfit Canada for the Purchased Assets it is conveying under this Agreement
and the balance of the Purchase Price shall constitute the portion of the
Purchase Price paid for the Purchased Assets SSCE is conveying under this
Agreement.

  

### (c) The Purchaser shall obtain, at the Purchasers sole expense, a
separate appraisal of the tangible assets consisting of the Brampton Plant
(the " _Brampton Plant Appraisal_ ") and shall deliver the results of such
appraisal to the Sellers for Sellers review and approval in accordance with
the procedures set forth in _Section 2.10(a)_; _provided, however_ , the
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Brampton
Plan Appraisal prior to the Closing Date, and Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to approve the amounts set forth in
the Brampton Plant Appraisal prior to the Closing Date. If the Purchaser or
Sellers are unable, after using commercially reasonable efforts to complete
and approve the Brampton Plant Appraisal prior to the Closing Date, the
Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
and approve the Brampton Plant Appraisal in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 2.10(a) _as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date. In no event shall any failure to obtain the Brampton Plant Appraisal
prior to the Closing Date delay or interfere with the Closing.

  

2.11 _Accounts Receivable_. Promptly after the Closing, the Sellers will
furnish the Purchaser with a list of the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable
outstanding as of the Closing Date. The Purchaser agrees to use its Ordinary
Course efforts to collect the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable, _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Purchaser shall not be required to institute a legal
proceeding or retain a collection agency or take any other action outside of
the Ordinary Course to collect the Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable. The
Sellers may at any time designate a representative to monitor such collection
at the Purchasers facility and the Purchaser shall

     

   

provide the Sellers with reasonable access to the Purchasers books and
records to the extent reasonably required by the Sellers to confirm the
Purchasers compliance with this _Section 2.11_. If the Purchaser receives a
payment from an account debtor relating solely to any Pre-Closing Account
Receivable, the Purchaser shall remit such payment to the Sellers within five
(5) business days of its receipt of such payment. On the tenth (10th) day of
each calendar month after the Closing, the Purchaser shall provide the
Sellers with a reconciliation of the collection of Pre-Closing Accounts
Receivable for the month ended prior thereto. To the extent the Purchaser
receives a payment from an account debtor of a Pre-Closing Account Receivable
who also has an account receivable owing to the Purchaser relating to a post-
Closing transaction, the Purchaser agrees to apply such payment to the oldest
invoice first unless such account debtor specifically designates
the application of such payment. The Purchaser agrees to execute such
notices, bills of sale, assignment agreements or other documents as may be
reasonably requested by Sellers and required to implement the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 2.11_. In the event that any Pre-Closing
Account Receivable from an account debtor remains outstanding for more than
180 days, SSCE shall consult with the Purchaser as to appropriate actions to
collect such account. With the Purchasers prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), the Seller may take reasonable
action to collect such receivable.

any of the Necessary Software (i) is licensed from a third party software
provider and requires the payment of a transfer fee, or (ii) cannot be
transferred for any reason, including the refusal of a third party
software provider to consent to such transfer, then, in each case, the
Purchaser shall have the option to pay the transfer fees and/or the cost to
acquire a replacement software system. The Sellers shall cooperate with the
Purchaser in dealing with the third-party vendors of the Necessary Software.
Prior to the Closing Date, as to any new operating systems which the

required.

shall grant to Purchaser and its Affiliates a non-exclusive license under all
Intellectual Property (other than the trademarks, which are governed by

good standing in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by
it with respect to the Business or the operation of the Business makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

### (c) Except as set forth in _Section 7.01 of the Disclosure Schedule_,
the Purchased Assets do not include (i) any, or any agreement to acquire,

7.02 _Authority_. Each Seller has the corporate right and power to
execute and deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each
Transaction Document; and has taken all requisite corporate action to
authorize its execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Transaction
Document and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and each
Transaction Document; and each of this Agreement has been, and at Closing
each Transaction Document will be, duly executed and delivered by each Seller
and is binding upon, and enforceable against, each Seller in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,

enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity).

  

7.03 _No Violations and Consents_. (a) Except as set forth in _Section
7.03(a) of the Disclosure Schedule_, the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and each Transaction Document by each Seller does not and
will not, after the giving of notice, or the lapse of time, or otherwise, (i)
conflict with, result in any violation of, or constitute a default under, the

to have a Material Adverse Effect, any Law or any Material Contract to which
either Seller is a party; (ii) result in the creation of any material Lien
upon any of the Purchased Assets; (iii) except as would not, individually or

Person, under any contract relating to the Business.

  

### (b) The execution and delivery by the Sellers of this Agreement and each

make any filing with or give any notice to, any Governmental Authority,
except (a) as disclosed in _Section 7.03 of the Disclosure Schedule_, (b)
pursuant to the applicable requirements of the HSR Act and the Competition
Act, or (c) where failure to obtain such consents, orders, approvals,

Adverse Effect.

sale of the Purchased Assets or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement was induced or procured through any Person acting on behalf of, or
representing, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates as broker, finder,

### (b) On the Balance Sheet Date, the Business did not have any debts,
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,

Agreement, or (ii) set forth in _Section 7.08 of the Disclosure Schedule_,

Business are covered by valid and currently effective insurance policies or

title to the Real Property free and clear of all Liens, _except_ (a) for the

or operation of the affected property or the conduct of the Business thereon
as it is currently being used and conducted. The Sellers have a good and
valid leasehold interest in all real property leased or subleased, whether
as landlord or tenant, by the Sellers and used in the Business (the "

representation or warranty as to compliance with Environmental Laws or any

assessments under the _Workplace Safety and Insurance Act_ (Ontario) in
relation to the Business and all of the Sellers contractors and

under or in relation to the Assumed Canadian Plan.

  

### (c) In regard to the Employee Plans covering Transferred Employees: (i)
there has been no termination of any "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in section 3(2) of ERISA) under which either Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate has or had any obligation to make a contribution, no proceedings to
terminate any such plan have been initiated, and no event described in ERISA
sections 4062, 4063 or 4069 has occurred with respect to any such plans; any
of which resulted in an insufficiency of such plans assets necessary to
satisfy all benefit

     

   

liabilities under the plan (within the meaning of ERISA section 4041(b)) and
(ii) except as set forth in _Section 7.16(c) of the Disclosure Schedule_,
neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any withdrawal liability

either Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates were to engage in a complete
withdrawal (as defined in Section 4203 of ERISA) or partial withdrawal (as
defined in Section 4205 of ERISA) from any such Multiemployer Plan. Sellers
represent that they have not taken any actions and to the best of their
knowledge no events have occurred in relation to any other employee benefit

either Seller or any of their ERISA Affiliates that would subject the
Purchased Assets to any undisclosed liabilities on or after the Closing Date.

  

### (d) Each Single Employer Plan covering Transferred Employees has been
administered, funded, invested and maintained in all material respects in

knowledge of the Sellers, threatened, with respect to any Single Employer
Plan covering Transferred Employees. No Person has engaged in a "prohibited

### (g) Each Single Employer Plan covering Transferred Employees which is
intended to qualify as a tax-qualified retirement plan under Code section
401(a) has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to that
effect, and, to the Sellers knowledge, nothing has occurred since the date
of that letter which would prevent any such plan from remaining so qualified.
Each Employee Plan covering Transferred Employees which is intended to be
registered with a Canadian provincial or federal Governmental Authority is so
registered and no event has occurred respecting any such Employee Plan which
would result in the revocation of the registration of such Employee Plan
(where applicable) or entitle any Person (without the consent of Seller) to
wind-up or terminate any Employee Plan, in whole or in part, or which could
otherwise reasonably be expected to adversely affect the tax status of any
such Employee Plan.

  

### (h) To the Sellers knowledge, no Employee Plan exists that could result
in the payment to any Transferred Employee of any money or other property
(including any severance payments, bonus or other compensation) or in the
acceleration of any other rights or benefits to any Transferred Employee or
in an acceleration of, or increase in, funding obligations as a result of the
transactions contemplated herein.

     

   

### (i) There are no Employee Plans covering Canadian Business Employees to
which Smurfit Canada or any of its Affiliates are required to contribute
pursuant to a Collective Bargaining Agreement which are not maintained or
administered by Smurfit Canada. Any payments, distributions or withdrawals
from or transfers of assets to or from the Assumed Canadian Plan have been
made in accordance with the valid terms of the Assumed Canadian Plan,
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements and applicable Law and occurred

Business as it is currently conducted, all of which are in full force and
effect, except for such governmental licenses, franchises, permits,
approvals, authorizations, exemptions, certificates, registrations and
similar documents or instruments, the absence or failure to be in full force
and effect of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Sellers are in compliance
with the terms and conditions of all such Permits except where such non-
compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Seller has received
notice of any claimed or purported default under any Permit and there are no
proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of Sellers, threatened, to cancel,
modify or change any such Permit, except in each case as, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

reasonably expected to result in such notice or claim; (e) neither Seller is
a party to any proceedings, investigations, or agreements concerning
Environmental Laws or the presence or release of any Hazardous Substances

doubt, all Phase I and Phase II assessments) or investigations concerning

Environmental Laws affecting the Business to the extent such documents are in

indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.02(a) _or _12.04(a)_ , as
applicable, for any Loss after the date on which the applicable
representation or warranty terminates pursuant to _Section 12.01_,

Losses which arise out of or are in respect of (a) any inaccuracy or
misrepresentation in or breach of any of the warranties and representations

Assumed Liabilities.

  

12.05 _Indemnification Notice_. Promptly upon obtaining knowledge of any
claim, event, fact or demand which gives rise to, or is reasonably expected
to give rise to, a claim for indemnification hereunder, any party seeking
indemnification under this _Article XII_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall
give written notice of such claim or demand (" _Notice of Claim_ ") to the
party from which indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
setting forth the amount of the claim, if known. The Indemnified Party shall
furnish to the Indemnifying Party, in reasonable detail, such information as
it may have with respect to such indemnification claim (including copies of
any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on it and
any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting the same). No failure or delay by the Indemnified Party in the
performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation
of any Indemnifying Party to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Party
harmless, except to the extent that such failure or delay shall have
materially adversely affected the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against, settle or satisfy any Loss for which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

  

12.06 _Indemnification Procedure_. (a) If the claim or demand set forth
in the  Notice of Claim given by the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
12.05_ is a claim or demand asserted by a third party, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to elect (by notice in writing to the Indemnified Party
within fifteen (15) days after the Date of the Notice of Claim) to defend

     

   

such third party claim or demand on behalf of the Indemnified Party, at the
Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense if (i) the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges that it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party in
respect of such claim or proceeding, (ii) the third party claim involves only
monetary damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief,
and (iii) settlement or an adverse judgment of the third party claim is not,
in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to establish a
pattern or practice adverse to the continuing business interests of the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend such third
party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party and its agents and representatives as reasonably requested
all records and other materials which are reasonably required in the defense
of such third party claim or demand and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate
with and assist the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such third party
claim or demand, subject to the reimbursement of the reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of a request by
the Indemnifying Party to so cooperate. So long as the Indemnifying Party
is defending such third party claim or demand in good faith, the Indemnified
Party shall not pay, settle or compromise such third party claim or demand
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to defend such third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense of such third party claim
or demand, at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
defend such third party claim or demand, does not defend such third party
claim in good faith or a timely manner, or if there are one or more legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party that conflict with those
available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right, in addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, to defend or participate in the defense of such
third party claim or demand; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) the
Indemnified Party shall not have any obligation to participate in the defense
of, or defend, any such third party claim or demand; (ii) the Indemnified
Partys defense of or its participation in the defense of any such third
party claim or demand shall not in any way diminish or lessen the obligations
of the Indemnifying Party under the agreements of indemnification set forth
in this _Article XII_, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by
the results obtained in good faith and in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 12.06_ by the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim or
demand.

  

### (b) The term " _Date of the Notice of Claim_ " as used in this _Article
XII_ shall mean the date the Notice of Claim is deemed delivered pursuant to
_Section 16.12_.

  

12.07 _Special Procedures Relating to Specified Environmental Matters_.
(a) The procedures set forth in this _Section 12.07_ shall apply to any
matter (each, a " _Specified Environmental Matter_ ") involving or relating
to any claim for indemnification for any breach of the representation and
warranty set forth in _Section 7.19_ or pursuant to _Section 12.02(c)
_hereof or for any other indemnification claim relating to environmental
matters. The procedures set forth in this _Section 12.07_ shall be in
addition to, but not in limitation of, the provisions of _Sections 12.05_ and
_12.06_ , _provided_ ,  _however_ , if there is a conflict between this
_Section 12.07_ and either of _Sections 12.05_ or _12.06_ , this _Section
12.07_ shall control.

  

### (b) SSCE shall have the right to control the management of any Specified
Environmental Matter, including, without limitation, management of any
Remedial Action which involves any one of the Properties (an " _On-Site
Remedial Action_ "). SSCE shall keep the

     

   

Purchaser reasonably informed regarding its management of any Specified
Environmental Matter, including providing copies to the Purchaser of notices,
correspondence, reports, submissions and work plans to be submitted to a
Governmental Authority overseeing any Specified Environmental Matter and
giving the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity (at the Purchasers expense) to
comment on such submissions and SSCE shall include all reasonable comments of
the Purchaser in such submissions. SSCE also shall provide the Purchaser
prior notice of any meetings with Governmental Authorities regarding any
Specified Environmental Matter, and the Purchaser shall be given
the opportunity to participate (at Purchasers expense) in such meetings
upon request. If Purchaser attends such meetings, it will not take any
position at such meetings contrary to the Sellers position. If the exchange
of information between the Purchaser and SSCE pursuant to this _Section
12.07(b)_ _ _ would require either party to reveal information that would
otherwise be protected by the attorney-client privilege, or any attorney work
product doctrine or other privilege pertaining to confidentiality, then SSCE
and the Purchaser will, at the request of either party, enter into
a reasonable confidentiality agreement, joint defense agreement, or
similar agreement, governing the terms and conditions of such access and
preserving, to the greatest extent possible, the confidentiality of the
information provided. The Purchaser and SSCE will cooperate with each other
as reasonably requested in all matters relating to any Specified
Environmental Matter.

  

### (c) If the cost of any Specified Environmental Matter that is subject to
an indemnity by SSCE hereunder is increased, or any environmental condition
on any of the Properties is exacerbated or worsened, due to an act
or omission by a Person other than SSCE, its Affiliates or their
respective employees, contractors or agents, the Sellers shall not be
responsible for any such increase in costs or other damages incurred to the
extent caused by such act or omission by a Person other than SSCE, its
Affiliates or their respective employees, contractors or agents. With respect
to any On-Site Remedial Action, the Sellers shall not be responsible for any
increased costs or Purchaser Losses to the extent they arise by reason of a
change in use of the Property that subjects the Property to more stringent
remediation standards.

  

### (d) The Purchaser agrees that SSCEs obligation under this Agreement with
respect to any claim involving Remedial Action, including, without
limitation, any On-Site Remedial Action, shall be to satisfy the requirements
of Law, including applicable Environmental Law that is in effect as of, and
is enforceable as of, the Closing, _provided_ , _however_ , SSCE shall only
be responsible for performing a remediation that reflects commercially
reasonable means and methods of complying with such Laws. With respect to any
On-Site Remedial Action, the Purchaser further agrees that SSCEs obligation
shall be to conduct a Remedial Action that is consistent with the current use
of the Property, as well as available options for institutional controls in
lieu of cleanup; _provided_ , that such controls are acceptable to the
relevant Governmental Authority and are in compliance with Law and do not
prevent or inhibit (other than de minimis conditions) the use of
such Property as occurred as of the Closing Date. The Purchaser further
agrees that it shall accept appropriate and reasonable engineering controls
or institutional controls, if such controls are needed in order for SSCE
to complete an On-Site Remedial Action consistent with the requirements of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that such controls are acceptable to the
relevant Governmental Authority and are in compliance with Law and do not
prevent or inhibit (other than de minimis conditions) the use of such
Property as occurred as of the Closing Date. A Remedial Action shall be
deemed completed when each applicable Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over, or

     

   

overseeing, the Remedial Action issues a written notice that no further
action is required, or, if no governmental oversight is applicable, then a
third-party reasonably acceptable to both parties reasonably determines that
the Remedial Action meets the applicable requirements of this Agreement and
of Environmental Law.

  

### (e) During the course of any On-Site Remedial Action whereby one of the
Properties is owned, leased or otherwise under the control of the Purchaser
at the time of such On-Site Remedial Action, the Purchaser shall, and hereby
does, grant to SSCE, its agents, employees, contractors, and consultants, at
no cost other than as set forth below, such access to such Property as is
reasonably necessary to perform or oversee and monitor performance of such
Remedial Action. Such access shall include use of utilities and reasonable
office, parking and storage space, _provided_ , that SSCE will reimburse the
Purchaser for the reasonable, out-of-pocket cost of any such utilities used
and _provided_ _further_ that such use of utilities and office, parking and
storage space does not materially impact on Purchasers use and enjoyment of
such Property. The Purchaser will also allow, to the extent of the
Purchasers authority to so allow, SSCE to install and maintain at, on or
under the Property remediation devices (including, but not limited to,
monitoring wells or ground water recovery and treatment systems) that are
required by any Governmental Authority or that are reasonably necessary to
perform any On-Site Remedial Action; _provided_ , that the installation and
maintenance of such devices does not materially impact on Purchasers use and
enjoyment of such Property.

  

### (f) Neither SSCE nor the Purchaser may enter into any settlement or
voluntary agreement relating to any Specified Environmental Matter which
settlement or voluntary agreement could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the other partys operational or financial interests, including, but
not limited to, any consent, order, settlement agreement or other voluntary
stipulation creating any obligation to perform Remedial Action at any one of
the Properties to levels more stringent than those based on the current use
of the Property on the Closing Date, without the consent of the other party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

  

### (g) SSCE shall have no indemnification obligations with respect to any
Loss, resulting, in whole or in part, from any voluntary actions by the
Purchaser or its consultants, agents, Affiliates, representatives or other
third parties acting with the permission or authorization of the Purchaser to
investigate and/or remediate soil, groundwater or other environmental media
at any of the Properties, except to the extent that Purchaser reasonably
believes that such voluntary actions conducted in good faith are necessary in
order to reduce the Losses otherwise subject to indemnity hereunder or to
otherwise comply with applicable Law and were not conducted for the sole
purpose of identifying the Loss at issue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of SSCE and the Purchaser shall notify the other party in advance of the
taking of any physical samples from any of the Properties by or on behalf of
SSCE or the Purchaser, as the case may be, and will permit the other party at
its own sole cost and expense to take or obtain split or duplicate samples.
The parties further agree that SSCE shall have no indemnification obligations
with respect to any Loss resulting, in whole or in part, from any disclosure,
report or other communication (whether oral or written) from any of the
Purchaser (or its Affiliates or agents) to any Governmental Authority or
other third party (" _Notification_ "), unless such Notification was required
by Environmental Law or other applicable Law at the time it was made.

  



   

58   

 

  

### (h) In the event that the Purchaser sells or otherwise transfers
ownership or control of any of the material Properties before the expiration
of SSCEs indemnification obligations under this Article XII with respect to
any Specified Environmental Matter relating to such Property, the Purchaser
will use commercially reasonable efforts to include in the instrument of sale
or transfer provisions that preserve all of the rights of SSCE under this
_Section 12.07_. Nothing herein is intended or should be construed to create
an obligation on the part of SSCE to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any
third party, unless SSCE expressly consents in writing to undertake such
obligation(s).

  

12.08 _Effect of Indemnity Payments_. The parties agree to treat all
payments made under the indemnity provisions of this  _Article XII_ as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such agreed
treatment shall govern for purposes hereof.

  

# ARTICLE XIII 
  
  _Confidentiality_

  

13.01 _Confidentiality of Materials_. The parties hereto agree that (A)
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, with respect to all non-public
technical, commercial and other information that is furnished or disclosed by
another party, including, but not limited to, information regarding such
partys (and its subsidiaries and Affiliates) organization, personnel,
business activities, customers, policies, assets, finances, costs, sales,
revenues, technology, rights, obligations, liabilities and strategies ("
_Information_ ") and (B) after the Closing Date, Sellers agree with respect
to all Information relating to the Purchaser, the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, and Purchaser agrees, with respect to all
Information relating to the Sellers (other than Information relating to the
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities), (a) such
Information is confidential and/or proprietary to the furnishing/disclosing
party and entitled to and shall receive treatment as such by the receiving
party; (b) the receiving party will hold in confidence and not disclose nor
use (except in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
any such Information, treating such Information with the same degree of care
and confidentiality as it accords its own confidential and proprietary
Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that the receiving party shall not have
any restrictive obligation with respect to any Information which (i) is
contained in a printed publication or otherwise available to the general
public, (ii) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act or omission
of the receiving party, (iii) is known by the receiving party without any
proprietary restrictions by the furnishing/disclosing party at the time of
receipt of such Information or (iv) is legally required to be disclosed;
provided that the receiving party shall give prompt notice to the disclosing
party of such requirement, disclose no more information than is so legally
required, and reasonably cooperate with any attempts by the disclosing party
to obtain a protective order or similar treatment; and (c) all such
Information furnished to either party by the other, unless otherwise
specified in writing, shall remain the property of the furnishing/disclosing
party and, in the event this Agreement is terminated, shall be returned to
it, together with any and all copies made thereof, upon request for such
return by it (except for documents submitted to a governmental agency with
the consent of the furnishing/disclosing party or upon subpoena and which
cannot be retrieved with reasonable effort) and in the case of (i)
oral information furnished to any party by the other which shall have been
reduced to writing by the receiving party and (ii) all internal documents of
any party

     

   

describing, analyzing or otherwise containing Information furnished by the
other party, all such writings and documents shall be destroyed, upon

13.02 _Remedy_. Each party hereto acknowledges that the remedy at law for
any breach by either party of its obligations under _Section 13.01_ is
inadequate and that the other party shall be entitled to equitable remedies,
including an injunction, in the event of breach by any other party.

  

# ARTICLE XIV

  

# _Employee Matters_

  

## 14.01 _Obligation to Hire Employees_.

  

### (a) (i) Effective on the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees to offer
immediate employment at a comparable job and at a comparable rate of pay at
the same employment location to the following employees so that no period of
unemployment would occur between employment with the Sellers prior to the
Closing Date and employment with the Purchaser on or after the Closing Date:
(A) other than those employees designated by the Sellers in _Section 14.01
_of the Disclosure Schedule, all of the Sellers salaried and non-union
hourly personnel employed immediately prior to the Closing Date in the
Business, (the " _Non-Union Employees_ "); (B) all of the Sellers unionized
hourly personnel employed immediately prior to the Closing Date in the
Business, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements applicable to such employees, as further explained in
_Section 14.03_ (the " _Hourly Employees_ "); and (C) subject to _Section
14.01(d)_, all employees employed by the Sellers immediately prior to the
Closing Date in the Business and who are temporarily absent from active
employment by reason of disability, illness, injury, workers compensation,
military leave, approved leave of absence or layoff who, at the Closing Date,
have rights to return to employment under the Sellers policies (the "
_Inactive Employees_ "); and (D) those information technology employees of
the Sellers designated in _Section 14.01(a)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule_
(the " _Technology Employees_ ") (collectively, the Inactive Employees,
Technology Employees, Non-Union Employees, and Hourly Employees shall be the
" _Business Employees_ "). All actively employed Business Employees who
accept the Purchasers offer of employment and are actively employed by the
Sellers immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Transferred Employees_
") shall become immediately employed on an uninterrupted basis by the
Purchaser as of the Closing Date **.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Business Employees based in Canada, Purchaser shall offer
employment to and/or hire such Business Employees under terms that comply
with applicable Law.

  

(ii) Effective on the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees, in the case of
those Business Employees with written employment agreements that are set
forth in _Section 14.01 of the Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Employment
Agreements_ "), that the Purchaser shall assume such Employment Agreements,
to the extent each such employee covered by one of the Employment Agreements,
prior to the Closing Date, waives his rights to severance under such
Employment Agreement following any termination of employment by such employee
in connection with, or resulting from, the transactions contemplated herein;
_provided_ , that, Seller and its applicable

     

   

Affiliates shall retain all liability with respect to the obligations
(payment or otherwise) arising under the promissory notes attached to or
referenced in such Employment Agreements. The employees described in this
_Section 14.01(a)(ii)_ _ _ shall be considered Business Employees and
such employees shall be considered Transferred Employees so long as they
waive their respective rights to severance under their Employment Agreements,
accept the Purchasers offer of employment and commence employment with the
Purchaser as of the Closing.

  

### (b) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 14.01_, the Purchaser
agrees to assume all employment-related obligations with respect to
Transferred Employees accruing on and after the Closing Date. For purposes of
this _Section 14.01_, "employment-related obligations" shall include, but is
not limited to, compensation for services performed for the Purchaser on or
after the Closing Date (and related employment and withholding taxes),
workers compensation benefits or claims (subject to _Section 14.08)_, and
benefits under Purchasers Welfare Benefits Plans, Purchasers
Defined Contribution Plan, and Purchasers Defined Benefit Plan covering
the Transferred Employees after the Closing Date (and for Transferred
Employees based in Canada, shall also include such other benefits and
obligations as may be required under applicable Law).

  

### (c) Effective on and after the Closing Date, the Sellers agree to retain
all employment-related obligations specified in this _Article XIV_ for all
Non-Union Employees and Hourly Employees who decline the Purchasers
offers of employment on or prior to the Closing Date, and for all Inactive
Employees who decline the Purchasers offers of employment on or after the
Closing Date, including but not limited to termination pay and severance pay
obligations.

  

### (d) On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with a
list of the Inactive Employees. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall make
offers of employment to such Inactive Employees at comparable jobs, rates of
pay, and at the same employment location, effective and contingent upon the
Inactive Employees return to active employment: (i) for Non-Union Employees,
within six months (or for Non-Union Employees based in Canada, within the
period provided under applicable Canadian Law) subject to the terms and
conditions under which the Sellers approved the Inactive Employees absence
or leave; and (ii) for Hourly Employees, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreements applicable to such Hourly
Employees as further explained in _Section 14.03_. The Sellers will be
responsible for all employment-related obligations and will continue to cover
all Inactive Employees under the Sellers Employee Plans throughout the
Inactive Employees absence or leave, as further explained in _Section
14.05_. Purchaser agrees to assume all employment-related obligations for
each Inactive Employee upon, and commencing with, such Inactive Employees
return to active employment with the Purchaser subject to the limitations
above for Non-Union Employees and Hourly Employees, upon which time such
Inactive Employee will become a Transferred Employee.

  

## 14.02 _WARN and Severance_

  

### (a) Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Sellers are relying
on Purchasers agreement to offer employment to all Business Employees in
accordance with the terms of _Section 14.01_. In that regard, Purchaser
retains sole responsibility for any obligations or

     

   

liabilities related to the Transferred Employees based in the United States
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Pub. Law
100-379, 102 Stat. 890 (1988) (together with other similar applicable laws, "
_WARN_ ") for any plant closing (as defined in WARN, " _Plant Closing_ ") or
mass layoff (as defined in WARN, " _Mass Layoff_ ") by Purchaser that occurs
on or after the Closing Date, and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the
Sellers harmless from same. Sellers agree not to effectuate a Plant Closing
or Mass Layoff affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or employee of the Business within the
ninety (90) day period prior to the Closing Date. Sellers further agree that
on the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with a true and accurate
list of any employees of the Business who suffered an employment loss (as
defined in WARN, " _Employment Loss_ ") in the preceding ninety (90) days,
and dates of and reasons for each such Employment Loss and the site of
employment and operating unit at which each such employee was last employed.
Sellers agree, upon Purchasers request, to reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser prior to Closing regarding Purchasers WARN obligations within the
ninety (90) day period following Closing.

  

### (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser will establish
a severance plan for Transferred Employees which shall be substantially
similar to the severance plan offered by Sellers immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Transferred Employees will receive credit for Past Service in
determining severance entitlement under Purchasers severance plans. The
Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Sellers harmless from and against, any claim made by a Transferred Employee
for severance pay (and/or, for Transferred Employees based in Canada,
termination pay, whether statutory, contractual, or at common law) on or
after the Closing Date in respect of a termination of a Transferred
Employees employment by the Purchaser on or after the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Sellers harmless from and against, any claim made by a Transferred Employee
for severance including, but not limited to, a claim that: (i) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby gives right to a
severance obligation of the Sellers, or (ii) that the Purchaser is not
offering comparable terms of employment as provided by the Sellers
immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Purchasers indemnification of the
Sellers specifically includes, but is not limited to, any claim by any such
Transferred Employee for back pay, front pay, benefits or compensatory
or punitive damages, any claim by any Governmental Authority for
penalties regarding any issue of prior notification (or any lack thereof) of
any Plant Closing or Mass Layoff that occurs after the Closing Date (and for
Transferred Employees based in Canada, termination pay, severance pay, and
damages for wrongful dismissal), as well as Sellers defense costs, including
attorneys fees, in defending any such claim.

  

### (c) Seller will remain liable for severance benefits (if any) for Non-
Union Employees, Hourly Employees, and Inactive Employees who do not become
Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date.

  

14.03 _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. The Purchaser recognizes that
the Sellers are parties to the Collective Bargaining Agreements. The
Purchaser agrees to assume and perform fully all rights, duties and
obligations of the Sellers with regard to the Collective Bargaining
Agreements on and after the Closing Date and to indemnify and hold harmless
the Sellers from and against any claims made by any Transferred Employee or
collective bargaining representative on or after the Closing Date which arise
out of or relate to the Collective

     

   

Bargaining Agreements, provided that the events giving rise to such claim
occurred on or after the Closing Date. Specifically, the Purchaser agrees to
assume sole responsibility and liability for: (i) any future benefit
increases provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreements, regardless of
whether the benefit increases are retroactive or relate to an event,
agreement, or period of time prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) any post-
retirement medical and group life insurance coverage provided for
Hourly Employees in Collective Bargaining Agreements, as explained in
_Section 14.05(e)_.

  

## 14.04 _Vacation_.

  

### (a) _Non-Union Employees_. The Purchaser shall be liable and
responsible for all vacation benefits for Non-Union Employees who are also
Transferred Employees on and after the Closing Date, to the extent such
benefits are reflected as a Current Liability on the Closing Balance Sheet. 
For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2006, the Purchaser shall offer vacation benefits comparable to the Sellers
vacation practices in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall
provide on a going forward basis annual paid vacation entitlement at least
equal to the annual paid vacation entitlement available under the Sellers
vacation practices as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, based
upon the Transferred Employees status and level of service with the Sellers
as of the Closing Date. Transferred Employees will receive credit for Past
Service in determining vacation entitlement under Purchasers applicable
vacation policies.

  

### (b) _Hourly Employees_. The Purchaser shall be liable and responsible
for all vacation benefits for Hourly Employees who are also Transferred
Employees on and after the Closing Date, including, but not limited to: (i)
assuming responsibility and liability for vacation benefits provided for in
Collective Bargaining Agreements covering Hourly Employees who are also
Transferred Employees; (ii) establishing vacation benefits comparable to the
Sellers vacation practices in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date;
and/or (iii) paying vacation benefits for the 2006 calendar year which have
not been paid by the Sellers prior to the Closing Date, to the extent
reflected as a Current Liability on the Closing Balance Sheet.

  

## 14.05 _Welfare Benefit Plans_.

  

### (a) _Welfare Benefit Plan Coverage_. The Sellers offer certain health,
medical, dental, vision, life insurance, and disability (including salary
continuation coverage) and related welfare benefit plans to its employees
(the " _Sellers  Welfare Benefit Plans_"). The Purchaser shall offer,
effective as of the Closing Date (or as of such later date on which a
Business Employee becomes a Transferred Employee), employee welfare benefit
plans which shall provide the Transferred Employees, including
Inactive Employees and eligible dependents, with the opportunity for health,
medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability coverage (including
salary continuation coverage) and related welfare benefit plans (the "
_Purchaser s Welfare Benefit Plans_"). The Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans
will be substantially similar in the aggregate to those offered by the
Sellers immediately prior to the Closing Date for the Non-Union Employees who
are Transferred Employees, including Inactive Employees, and their
eligible dependents. The Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans will provide
benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements applicable to Hourly Employees who are Transferred
Employees, including Inactive Employees, and their eligible dependents,

     

   

immediately prior to the Closing Date, as further explained in _Section
14.03_. Coverage shall be provided to the Transferred Employees without: (i)
evidence of insurability if such individuals were covered under a similar
Sellers Welfare Benefit Plan; and (ii) application of any pre-existing
physical or mental condition restrictions to the extent such condition was
satisfied or waived under the similar Sellers Welfare Benefit Plan. The
Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans will provide that Transferred Employees
shall receive credit for Past Service (and shall recognize original hire
dates therewith) prior to the Closing Date for all purposes under the
Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans, including determining eligibility for
participation, and the duration and amount, if any, of short-term disability
benefits due (including time credited toward fulfilling a waiting period
immediately prior to the Closing Date).

  

### (b) _Enrollment_. The Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to complete the enrollment process for the Transferred Employees so
that such Transferred Employees will be able to commence participation in the
Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans on the Closing Date (or, for Inactive
Employees, upon commencement of active employment with the Purchaser, if
later).

  

### (c) _Claims Under the Sellers  Welfare Benefit Plans_. The Sellers
shall retain all the obligations and liabilities of any kind arising under or
related to claims under the Sellers Welfare Benefit Plans based on charges
for covered expenses incurred, including but not limited to claims:

  

#### (i) by Business Employees, former employees and eligible dependents who
were employed by the Sellers at any time prior to the Closing Date, but who
do not become Transferred Employees;

  

#### (ii) by Inactive Employees and eligible dependents covered under the
Sellers Welfare Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date for claims incurred
for the period of time during which the individual is on inactive status,
including claims incurred after the Closing Date;

  

#### (iii) by each Transferred Employee and eligible dependent who, prior to
becoming a Transferred Employee or eligible dependent, incurs a claim for
services rendered, and applicable charges related thereto, prior to the
Closing Date, even if the claim relates to an in-patient hospital stay prior
to the Closing Date and the hospital discharge related to such claim occurs
after the Closing Date; except that claims incurred following the Closing
Date by such Transferred Employee, whether related or not, shall not be
covered by the Sellers; and

  

#### (iv) by Existing Retiree Welfare Plan Participants.

  

### (d) _Welfare Benefit Plan Deductibles, Co-Payments, and Out of Pocket
Maximums_. The Purchaser agrees that, to the extent which a Transferred
Employee and his or her dependents have satisfied in whole or in part a
deductible amount for calendar year 2006, or has paid any co-payments or out-
of-pocket expenses under any of the Sellers Welfare Benefit Plans,
such amount(s) shall be counted toward satisfaction of any applicable
calendar year 2006 deductible, co-payment, or out-of-pocket expense maximums
under Purchasers Welfare Benefit

     

   

Plans. Subject to applicable Law, Sellers shall provide to Purchaser, as soon
as practicable after the Closing Date, such data, records, documentation and
information relating to Transferred Employees and their participation in any
Employee Plan as Purchaser may reasonably require for the administration of
claims under the Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans.

  

### (e) _Retiree Coverage_. Certain former Non-Union Employees, Hourly
Employees, and Inactive Employees who were employed by the Sellers in the
Business and who retired from employment prior to the Closing Date are
participants in medical and group life insurance plans of the Sellers ("
_Sellers  Retiree Plans_"). These retirees and their eligible dependents
who are covered under the Sellers Retiree Plans as of the Closing Date are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Existing Retiree Welfare Plan
Participants_."  The Sellers Retiree Plans also provide such post-retirement
coverage for employees who, after satisfying the applicable requirements,
will become eligible for such coverage based upon future retirement (the "
_Future Retiree Welfare Plan Participants_ "). The Sellers shall continue to
cover all Existing Retiree Welfare Plan Participants after the Closing Date
and the Purchaser shall not assume any liabilities or obligations for such
Existing Retiree Welfare Plan Participants on or after the Closing Date.
However, effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish medical
and group life insurance plans to cover all Transferred Employees who are
also Future Retiree Welfare Plan Participants, including Hourly Employees
subject to Collective Bargaining Agreements (" _Purchaser s Retiree
Plans_"). The Purchasers Retiree Plans will provide benefits which will be
substantially similar to those offered to the Future Retiree Welfare Plan
Participants as of the Closing Date under Sellers Retiree Plans or in
Collective Bargaining Agreements.

  

### (f) _COBRA_. The Sellers shall be responsible for providing health care
continuation coverage of any former employees and their qualified dependents
who, at the time of the Closing Date, are receiving continuation of health
care coverage as required by the Consolidation Omnibus Reconciliation Act of
1985 (" _COBRA_ ") under the Sellers Welfare Benefit Plans and those
employees (and their qualified dependents) who do not become Transferred
Employees. The Purchaser shall be responsible for providing health care
continuation coverage as required by COBRA to Transferred Employees who are
terminated by the Purchaser on or after the Closing Date.

  

### (g) The Purchaser hereby agrees that, through the first anniversary of
the day before the Closing Date, Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans shall not
be terminated with respect to coverage thereunder of the Non-Union Employees
who are also Transferred Employees, nor shall any amendment of the
Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans be made which contradicts this _Section
14.05(g) _or otherwise effectively reduces or eliminates the total value of
benefits to be provided under the Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans for any
Non-Union Employees who are also Transferred Employees during such one (1)
year period, except as may be required by the applicable government agency or
by Law to ensure continued compliance with the Code or ERISA. Purchaser
further agrees that Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans, with respect to
coverage thereunder of Hourly Employees who are also Transferred Employees,
will be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements applicable to such Hourly Employees as of the Closing
Date, as further explained in _Section 14.03_.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Sellers agree to provide to the Purchaser
descriptions of any material amendments, modifications, or reductions to the
benefits under any

     

   

of the Sellers Welfare Benefit Plans which are made within one year of the
Closing Date to the extent Sellers reasonably conclude that such amendments,
modifications or reductions would have affected Transferred Employees if the
Transferred Employees had remained in the employment of the Sellers, and the
Purchaser shall be entitled, but not obligated, to make conforming amendments
or modifications with respect to, or conforming reductions with respect to
benefits levels under, the corresponding Purchasers Welfare Benefit Plans.

  

## 14.06 _Defined Contribution Plans_.

  

### (a) The Sellers provide certain defined contribution plans to their
employees (the " _Sellers  Defined Contribution Plans_"). Immediately prior
to the Closing, Sellers shall cause each of the Transferred Employees to
become fully vested in all of their contributions and account balances
(including, without limitation, all employer-paid and matching contribution
account balances) under the Sellers Defined Contribution Plans. As of the
Closing Date, the Purchaser or one or more of its Affiliates shall establish
one or more defined contribution plans to cover the Transferred Employees or
shall include such Transferred Employees in currently established Defined
Contribution Plans (collectively, " _Purchaser s Defined Contribution
Plans_"). The Purchasers Defined Contribution Plans shall provide the
Transferred Employees with substantially similar features of the Sellers
Defined Contribution Plans, including, but not limited to: (i) the
opportunity to elect to make pre-tax payroll reduction contributions and, if
eligible, catch-up contributions; and (ii) the opportunity to receive an
employer matching contribution based on a portion of the Transferred
Employees pre-tax payroll reduction contributions. The Purchasers Defined
Contribution Plans will provide that Transferred Employees shall receive
credit for Past Service with the Sellers (and shall recognize original hire
dates therewith) prior to the Closing Date for purposes of determining
eligibility for participation and vesting. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Sellers agree to provide to the Purchaser
descriptions of any material amendments, modifications, or reductions to the
benefits under any of the Sellers Defined Contribution Plans which are made
within one year of the Closing Date to the extent Sellers reasonably
conclude that such amendments, modifications or reductions would have
affected Transferred Employees if the Transferred Employees had remained in
the employment of the Sellers, and the Purchaser shall be entitled, but not
obligated, to make conforming amendments or modifications with respect to, or
conforming reductions with respect to benefits levels under,
the corresponding Purchasers Defined Contribution Plans.

  

### (b) The Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably necessary to complete
the enrollment process for the Transferred Employees so that such Transferred
Employees will be able to commence participation in the Purchasers Defined
Contribution Plan as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.

  

### (c) To the extent allowable by Law, the Purchaser shall take any and
all necessary actions to cause the trustee of a Purchasers Defined
Contribution Plan, if requested to do so by a Transferred Employee, to accept
a direct rollover of all or a portion of such Transferred Employees
distribution from the Sellers Defined Contribution Plan.

  

### (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser
hereby agrees that, through the first anniversary of the day before the
Closing Date, Purchasers Defined Contribution Plans shall not be terminated
or suspended with respect to coverage

     

   

thereunder of the Non-Union Employees who are also Transferred Employees, nor
shall any amendment of the Purchasers Defined Contribution Plans be made
which contradicts this _Section 14.06(d)_ _ _ or otherwise effectively
reduces or eliminates the total value of benefits to be provided under the
Purchasers Defined Contribution Plans for any such Non-Union Employees who
are also Transferred Employees during such one (1) year period, except as may
be required by the applicable government agency or by Law to ensure continued
compliance with the Code or ERISA. Purchaser further agrees that Purchasers
Defined Contribution Plans, with respect to coverage thereunder of Hourly
Employees, will be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Collective Bargaining Agreements applicable to such Hourly Employees as of
the Closing Date, as further explained in _Section 14.03_.

  

## 14.07 _Defined Benefit Plans_.

  

### (a) The Sellers offer certain defined benefit plans to its employees (the
" _Sellers  Defined Benefit Plans_"). Immediately prior to the Closing,
Sellers shall cause each of the Transferred Employees to become fully vested
in all of their account balances under the Sellers Defined Benefit Plans. As
of the Closing Date, the Purchaser or one or more of its Affiliates shall
establish one or more defined benefit plans to cover the Transferred
Employees or shall include such Transferred Employees in
currently established defined benefit plans (collectively, " _Purchaser s
Defined Benefit Plans_"). The Purchasers Defined Benefit Plans shall provide
the Transferred Employees with substantially similar features of Sellers
Defined Benefit Plans in effect as of the Closing Date, including, but not
limited to provisions regarding credited service for eligibility and
vesting, compensation, computation of benefit levels, eligibility for a
benefit and the form and timing of a benefit distribution, early retirement
opportunities, disability retirement opportunities, and other existing
subsidies. The Purchasers Defined Benefit Plans shall provide that credited
service for eligibility and vesting, and entitlement to benefits (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals or other benefit factors, except and only to the
extent such benefit factors are expressly required pursuant to the terms of
an applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement) under the Sellers Defined
Benefit Plans (including recognition of original hire date therewith) shall
be recognized under Purchasers Defined Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers agree to provide to the
Purchaser descriptions of any material amendments, modifications, or
reductions to the benefits under any of the Sellers Defined Benefit Plans
which are made within one year of the Closing Date to the extent
Sellers reasonably conclude that such amendments, modifications or reductions
would have affected Transferred Employees if the Transferred Employees had
remained in the employment of the Sellers, and the Purchaser shall be
entitled, but not obligated, to make conforming amendments or modifications
with respect to, or conforming reductions with respect to benefits levels
under, the corresponding Purchasers Defined Benefit Plans. In relation to
the Assumed Canadian Plan, Smurfit Canada shall, in accordance with clause
(p) of the definition of Purchased Assets, instruct the trustee appointed
under the master trust agreement between Smurfit Canada and such trustee (the
" _Master Trust_ "), forthwith after the Closing Date, to redeem units of the
Master Trust held by the trustee of the Assumed Canadian Plan for cash or
marketable securities in such manner as agreed to by the Purchaser and
Sellers, acting reasonably, subject to and in accordance with the terms of
the Master Trust. Smurfit Canada shall instruct the trustee of the Master
Trust to transfer the redeemed units to the pension fund of the Assumed
Canadian Plan as designated by the Purchaser in such manner as agreed to by
the Purchaser and Sellers. Smurfit Canada and the Purchaser shall do all
other things necessary so

     

   

as to effect the cessation of the Assumed Canadian Plan as a participating
plan under the Master Trust effective as of the Closing Date.

  

### (b) The Sellers shall freeze all credited service for vesting and benefit
accrual purposes as of the Closing Date for all Transferred
Employees participating in and covered by Sellers Defined Benefit Plans,
other than the Assumed Canadian Plan.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser
hereby agrees that, through the first anniversary of the day before the
Closing Date, Purchasers Defined Benefit Plans shall not be terminated
or suspended with respect to coverage thereunder of the Non-Union Employees
who are also Transferred Employees, nor shall any amendment of the
Purchasers Defined Benefit Plans be made which contradicts this _Section
14.07(c) _or otherwise effectively reduces or eliminates the total value of
benefits to be provided under Purchasers Defined Benefit Plans for any Non-
Union Employees who are also Transferred Employees during such one (1) year
period, except as may be required by the applicable government agency or by
Law to ensure continued compliance with the Code or ERISA. Purchaser further
agrees that Purchasers Defined Benefit Plans, with respect to coverage
thereunder of Hourly Employees, will be in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreements applicable to such Hourly
Employees as of the Closing Date, as further explained in _Section 14.03_.

  

14.08 _Workers  Compensation_. The Sellers shall remain solely
responsible for liability arising from workers compensation claims, both
medical and disability, or other government-mandated programs which are based
on events, accidents and injuries which occur prior to the Closing Date,
regardless of the date such events, accidents or injuries are reported. The
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for claims of Transferred Employees for
events, accidents and injuries that occur on or after the Closing Date.

  

14.09 _Miscellaneous Employee Matters_. With respect to employment Tax
matters (i) purchaser shall assume SSCEs entire obligation to prepare, file,
and furnish IRS W-2s with respect to the Transferred Employees; (ii)
Purchaser and SSCE shall agree to elect the "predecessor-successor" basis for
each Transferred Employee pursuant to the alternate procedures described by
Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 34 I.R.B. 320 and (iii) Purchaser and
Sellers shall work in good faith to adopt similar procedures under applicable
wage payment, reporting and withholding Laws in all appropriate
jurisdictions.

  

## 14.10 _Treatment of Equity Incentives_.

  

### (a) Effective as of the Closing, Sellers shall cause the following equity
incentive awards which are outstanding immediately prior to the Closing to
vest as follows:

  

#### (i) all restricted stock units held by Transferred Employees as of the
Closing Date under the 2004 SSCE Long Term Incentive Plan (" _LTIP_ ") shall
become fully vested as of the Closing Date; and

  

#### (ii) all options, except options listed in (b)(i) below, shall become
fully vested as of the Closing Date and remain exercisable by the Transferred
Employee for ninety (90) days after the Closing Date; except, that a
Transferred Employee who meets the

     

   

retirement provisions set forth within the LTIP may exercise his or her
options for a period that is the lesser of: (x) five (5) years from the
Closing Date; or (y) the expiration of the options term under the LTIP; and

  

#### (iii) any company premium restricted stock units received under the SSCE
Management Incentive Plan (" _MIP_ ") if the Transferred Employee satisfies
the retirement provisions set forth in the restricted stock unit agreements
and continues the deferral of the respective non-premium restricted stock
units received under the MIP in accordance with the original three year
deferral period for each non-premium restricted stock unit, the premium
restricted stock units shall become fully vested, settled in shares
and distributed to participants under the cycle set forth in the restricted
stock unit agreement (i.e., three years from the deferral date); _provided,
however_ , that any such premium restricted stock units held by a Transferred
Employee that do not otherwise become fully vested as described above shall
instead vest at such times as such premium restricted stock units would have
vested pursuant to the terms of the MIP and the applicable award agreements
thereunder if the Transferred Employee had remained employed with Sellers
through the applicable vesting dates, subject to the Transferred Employees
continued employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates through such applicable
vesting dates.

  

### (b) Effective as of the Closing, the following equity incentive awards
held by Transferred Employees which are outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing shall be forfeited as described below to the extent provided under
the terms of the applicable Employee Plans or award agreements:

  

#### (i) all performance options granted on or after January 1, 2006 under
the LTIP shall be forfeited as of the Closing Date; and

  

#### (ii) any company premium restricted stock units received under the MIP
that do not otherwise become vested in accordance with Section 14.10(a)(iii)
above.

  

### (c) The Sellers and Purchaser agree that any Tax deduction attributable
to the vesting or exercise of any options to acquire SSCC common stock held
by any Transferred Employee are Tax deductions of the Sellers and to file all
Tax returns consistent with this agreement and not take any action that is
inconsistent with this agreement.

  

14.11 _Multiemployer Plan Liabilities_. A list of the Multiemployer Plans
that Sellers are currently obligated to contribute to pursuant to the
Collective Bargaining Agreements is set forth on _Section 14.11 of the
Disclosure Schedule_. Purchaser is assuming hereunder such
Collective Bargaining Agreements and, hence, Sellers obligations under the
Multiemployer Plans commencing on and after the Closing. Accordingly, to the
extent required under Section 4204 of ERISA to avoid the imposition of any
withdrawal liability on Sellers in connection with the Closing, Purchaser
shall (x) contribute to the Multiemployer Plans for substantially the same
number of contribution base units for which Sellers had an obligation to
contribute under such Collective Bargaining Agreements and (y) provide to
each of the Multiemployer Plans for a period of five plan years commencing
with the first plan year beginning after the Closing, a bond to be obtained
by Purchaser issued by a corporate surety corporation, a sum to be provided
by Purchaser held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution, or an
irrevocable letter of

     

   

credit held in escrow to be obtained by Purchaser, equal to the greater of
(I) the average annual contribution required to be made by Sellers under each
Multiemployer Plan for the three plan years preceding the plan year in which
the Closing occurs (which amounts with respect to the Multiemployer Plans as
actually made for the three preceding plan years are set forth on _Section
14.11 of the Disclosure Schedule)_, or (II) the annual contributions that
Seller was required to make under each Multiemployer Plan for the last plan
year prior to the plan year in which the Closing occurs. Purchaser and
Sellers shall cooperate to obtain a waiver of the bond, escrow, or letter of
credit held in escrow set forth above. The bond, escrow or letter of credit
shall be paid by the Purchaser to the applicable Multiemployer Plan if
Purchaser withdraws from or fails to make a contribution to the Multiemployer
Plan at any time during the first five plan years beginning after the Closing
Date; provided, however, that if on or after the Closing Date, and within
the 2006 plan year for the applicable Multiemployer Plan, the Purchaser
withdraws from or fails to make a required contribution to such Multiemployer
Plan, the Purchaser will be solely liable to such Multiemployer Plan
for such withdrawal liability. As required by Section 4204 of ERISA,
if Purchasers actions result in a complete or partial withdrawal in the 2006
plan year for the Multiemployer Plan or during the first five plan years
beginning after the Closing Date, Sellers shall be secondarily liable for
any withdrawal liability they would have had to the applicable Multiemployer
Plan if the liability of the Purchaser is not paid; however, Seller retains
the right to seek remedies, as provided for in this Agreement, for any breach
by Purchaser of the provisions in this _Section 14.11_.

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 14.11_,
SSCE and Purchaser shall split equally all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) of Purchaser in connection with any bond, escrow,
letter of credit or other form of credit support which Purchaser obtains to
satisfy the requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA. Either Purchaser or
Sellers shall promptly notify the other party of any demand for payment of
withdrawal liability received by Purchaser or Sellers from any Multiemployer
Plan.

  

## 14.12 _Funding Deficiency of the Assumed Canadian Plan_.

  

### (a) With respect to the Assumed Canadian Plan, the Sellers covenant and
agree to cause Mercer Human Resource Consulting (" _Mercer_ ") to perform and
deliver to the Sellers and Purchaser prior to Closing an actuarial analysis
of the estimated funded status of the Assumed Canadian Plan on a solvency
basis as of the Closing Date using the assumptions listed in _Schedule 14.12
of the Disclosure Schedule_.

  

### (b) On or immediately prior to the Closing Date, SSCC shall pay Purchaser
an amount equal to the estimated solvency deficiency for the Assumed Canadian
Plan described in _Section 14.12(a)_, not to exceed the lesser of the amount
of the maximum permitted contribution under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and
 $2,100,000 (Canadian).

  

### (c) At the option of SSCC or the Purchaser, Mercer will perform an actual
actuarial analysis of the funded status of the Assumed Canadian Plan on a
solvency basis as of the Closing Date using the assumptions listed in
_Schedule 14.12 of the Disclosure Schedule_ and taking into account the
payment made under _Section 14.12(h)_. If there is an actual solvency
deficiency as described in the prior sentence, SSCC shall pay to Purchaser
the amount equal to the actual solvency deficiency. If Mercer determines that
the Assumed Canadian Plan has an

     

   

actual solvency surplus as of the Closing Date, then Purchaser will pay SSCC
the lesser of: the actual solvency surplus, or the payment made under
_Section 14.12(b)_.

  

### (d) Sellers and Purchaser shall each be liable for 50% of all
professional fees and expenses incurred in respect of the Mercer analyses
described in _Section 14.12(a) _and  _(c) _above. Purchaser and their
actuaries shall have a right to review and comment on any analysis prepared
by Mercer, and shall have access to any work papers of Mercer used in
preparation of the actuarial analysis.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers liability for the funding deficiency under this Section
14.12 is limited in the aggregate to a maximum to $2,100,000 (Canadian).

  

# ARTICLE XV 
  
  _Certain Other Understandings_

  

15.01 _Post Closing Access to Records and Records Retention_.

  

### (a) The Purchaser and the Sellers shall provide each other with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by the other in connection with the
preparation of any return or report of Taxes, any audit or other examination
by any taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings
relating to liabilities for Taxes. Such assistance shall include making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business
hours to provide additional information or explanation of material provided
hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant Tax returns and
supporting material. The party requesting assistance hereunder
shall reimburse the assisting party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in providing assistance. The Purchaser and the Sellers will retain
for the full period of any statute of limitations and provide the others with
any records or information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit,
examination, proceeding or determination.

  

### (b) Without limiting _Section 15.01(a) _above, in order to facilitate
the resolution of any claims made by or against any third party (other than
any such claims made by or against the other party) after the Closing, upon
reasonable notice, each party hereto shall, after the Closing but subject to
any confidentiality obligation to a third Person, maintenance of attorney-
client privilege and any other bona fide and good faith restriction on its
ability to provide information or access: (i) afford the officers, employees
and authorized agents and representatives of the other party reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the offices, properties, books and
records of such party with respect to the operation of the Business that are
in the possession of such party, (ii) furnish to the officers, employees
and authorized agents and representatives of the other party such
additional financial and other information regarding the Business as the
other party may from time to time reasonably request and (iii) make available
to the other party, the employees of such party whose assistance, testimony
or presence of such persons as witnesses in hearings or trials for such
purposes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such investigation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of such party. In
no event shall any Seller have access to the tax returns of Purchaser.

     

   

### (c) Each party hereto agrees for a period extending five (5) years after
the Closing Date not to destroy or otherwise dispose of any records relating
to the Business and to the period prior to Purchasers acquisition of the
Purchased Assets. After such five (5) year period, such party may destroy or
otherwise dispose of such records if such party shall offer in writing to
surrender such records to the other party and the other party shall fail
to agree in writing to take possession thereof during the thirty (30) day
period after such offer is made.

  

15.02 _Consents Not Obtained at Closing_. SSCE agrees to attempt
diligently to obtain any necessary consents which may be required to effect
the assignment to the Purchaser of the Assumed Contracts and Permits and the
Purchaser will diligently cooperate with SSCE in obtaining the same, and will
take such steps as reasonably requested by SSCE with respect thereto. Sellers
and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that they shall diligently cooperate in
identifying and obtaining the transfers of existing and the issuance of new
Permits, including Environmental Permits. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
will consult with Purchaser with respect to the obtaining of such consents,
will keep Purchaser apprised of the status thereof and will allow Purchaser
to participate in any discussions or negotiations relating to such consents.
Purchaser agrees to furnish the Sellers with financial and other information
relating to Purchaser reasonably requested by the parties from whom the
consent is being obtained. In obtaining such consents, Sellers will not agree
to any material modifications of any material terms of such contracts and
Permits without the consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). If Sellers are not able to obtain any such required
consents as of the Closing, upon the request of Purchaser during the 6-month
period from the Closing Date, Sellers will use reasonable commercial efforts
to obtain such consents necessary to transfer such contracts and Permits to
Purchaser (and upon transferring any such contract or Permit to Purchaser
after obtaining the necessary consents, such contract or Permit, as the case
may be, shall be considered an Assumed Contract and a Purchased Asset under
this Agreement). Except as provided in _Section 5.04(b)_, in such cases
where such consents have not been obtained by the Closing Date, this
Agreement, to the extent permitted by Law, shall constitute an equitable
assignment by the Sellers to the Purchaser of all of the Sellers right,
benefit, title and interest in and to the Assumed Contracts, and the
Purchaser shall be deemed to be the Sellers agent for the purpose of
completing, fulfilling and discharging all of the Sellers rights and
liabilities arising after the Closing Date under the Assumed Contracts, and
the Sellers shall take all reasonably necessary steps and actions to provide
the Purchaser with the benefits of such contracts and commitments.

  

15.03 _Bulk Sale Waiver and Indemnity_. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that no filings with respect to any bulk sales or similar laws have
been made, nor are they intended to be made, nor are such filings a condition
precedent to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall
indemnify and save harmless the Purchaser, its directors, officers,
employees, agents and shareholders, on an after-tax basis, from and against
all claims which may be made or brought against them or Losses which they may
suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, arising out of such non-compliance
other than claims or Losses relating to the Assumed Liabilities.

  

15.04 _Use of Business Names_.

  

### (a) Purchaser and its Affiliates may use the supply of product literature
and advertising that is part of the Inventories until such supply is
exhausted or until the end of the

     

   

period of 180 days after the Closing Date (the " _Initial Phase-out Period_
"), whichever occurs earlier. If the supply is exhausted before the end of
the Initial Phase-out Period, the product literature and advertising may be
reprinted, provided that the reprinted versions contain the following
changes:

  

#### (i) deletion of "Smurfit-Stone" in any form including but not limited to
the Smurfit-Stone logos; and

  

#### (ii) if desired by the Purchaser and its Affiliates, the addition of the
phrase "formerly manufactured by Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation";

  

and provided that all use of the reprinted literature and advertising will
terminate no later than one (1) year from the Closing Date (the " _Final
Phase-out Period_ ").

  

### (b) Purchaser and its Affiliates may sell and otherwise distribute the
supply of products that is part of the Inventories, even though the products
bear a Smurfit-Stone logo or other Smurfit-Stone designation, until such
supply is exhausted or until the end of the Initial Phase-out Period,
whichever occurs earlier. Product made by the Purchaser and its Affiliates
after the Closing Date may, if desired by the Purchaser and its Affiliates,
bear a decal or other identification with the words "formerly manufactured by
Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation," _provided_ that no product is
manufactured, sold or distributed bearing "Smurfit-Stone" or "Smurfit-
Stone Container Corporation" in any form and after the end of the Final
Phase-out Period, by the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

  

### (c) The Purchaser and its Affiliates may use the supply of stationery and
invoices that is part of the Inventories until such supply is exhausted or
until the end of the Initial Phase-out Period, whichever occurs earlier,
provided that these materials are modified by sticker, decal or similar means
to obliterate the appearance of "Smurfit-Stone" in any form, including but
not limited to a Smurfit-Stone logo.

  

### (d) The Purchaser shall remove all "Smurfit-Stone" signs from the
premises it acquires under this Agreement within six (6) months after the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have up to nine
(9) months after the Closing Date to remove such signage from trucks and
service vehicles.

  

### (e) Other than as provided above in this _Section 15.04_, no use of
Smurfit-Stone in logo form or in any other manner shall be made by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates, except as required by applicable Law or in a
neutral non-trademark manner to refer to the history of the Business. Neither
the Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall acquire or adopt any name, trademark
or trade dress similar or confusingly similar to any name or trademark
retained by Smurfit-Stone under this Agreement.

  

### (f) For 90 days after Closing, Sellers shall display on their website a
mutually-agreeable statement about the sale of the Business and link to
Purchasers website.

  

15.05 _Communications and Remittances_. (a) All mail, communications,
notices and/or remittances regarding sales, reimbursements or credits
relating to sales after the Closing Date possessed or received by the Sellers
at any time after the Closing Date shall be promptly

     

   

turned over to the Purchaser by the Sellers. The Sellers shall cooperate with
the Purchaser and take such actions as the Purchaser may reasonably request,
to assure that customers of the Business send such remittances directly to
the Purchaser, and to assure that such remittances from customers of the
Business which are improperly sent to the Sellers are not commingled with the
Sellers assets, but are promptly delivered to the Purchaser.

  

### (b) All mail, communications, notices and/or remittances regarding sales,
reimbursements or credits relating to sales prior to the Closing Date,
possessed or received by the Purchaser at any time after the Closing Date
shall be promptly turned over to the Sellers by the Purchaser. The Purchaser
shall cooperate with the Sellers, and take such actions as the Sellers may
reasonably request, to assure that such remittances improperly sent to
Purchaser are not commingled with the Purchasers assets, but are promptly
delivered to the Sellers.

  

### (c) Promptly upon Closing, the parties agree to send a
joint communication to trade customers relating to changes in address for
remittances and other correspondence.

  

15.06 _Access to Insurance Coverage_. The Sellers shall use reasonable
best efforts to arrange for the Purchaser to be added as additional named
insured to all of the Sellers and their Affiliates insurance policies (or
renewal or replacement policy in respect thereof) covering the Business and
the Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date such that (and only for the
purpose that) claims made against the Purchaser or its Affiliates in respect
of events occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent, if any,
constituting Assumed Liabilities, would be covered in the same manner and to
the same extent as if the Closing had not occurred, provided that the Sellers
and their Affiliates shall not be required to maintain any such insurance
policy (or renewal or replacement policy in respect thereof) in effect more
than two years after the Closing Date. If the Purchaser elects to have the
Sellers arrange the coverage described herein, the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall work together to attempt to implement such coverage, but the Purchaser
shall be solely responsible for reviewing the terms of any such endorsement
to ensure that it is satisfied with the coverage that would be provided
thereby. The Sellers agree that insurance claims by the Purchaser under the
Sellers and their Affiliates insurance policies shall receive the same
priority and be subjected to any deductibles and retentions equitably
with all claims by Sellers or their Affiliates under such policies. If,
despite its reasonable best efforts, the Sellers are not able to implement
such coverage, the Non-Assumed Liabilities shall be deemed to include all
liabilities and obligations relating to the Business and Purchased Assets to
the extent covered by Sellers or their Affiliates existing insurance
policies, binders and programs, and _Section 2.07(c) _shall be deemed
amended accordingly; provided, however such liabilities and obligations
relating to the Business and Purchased Assets shall only constitute Non-
Assumed Liabilities to the extent of the proceeds of insurance actually
recovered by the Sellers or their Affiliates, and if there are any
deductibles or retention costs applied consistently with the equitable
principles of this _Section 15.06_, the deductible amounts and retention
costs plus any costs to collect such insurance proceeds, including reasonable
attorney fees and expenses, shall constitute Assumed Liabilities. The Sellers
shall cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchasers expense, in and use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the collection of all such
insurance proceeds in respect of claims made by Purchaser. Purchaser shall be
obligated to pay (and in any event reimburse the Sellers promptly on demand
from time to time for) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred by the Sellers in connection with this _Section 15.06_; such
reasonable costs and expenses shall in any event be considered to include

     

   

any premium increases (including retroactive premium adjustments) to the
extent attributable to claims made under this _Section
15.06_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser and
Sellers agree to work in good faith between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date to investigate the availability of separate insurance
coverage for Purchaser for environmental liabilities with comparable coverage
as Sellers policies related to events occurring prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall determine in its sole discretion whether to purchase any such
policy.

  

15.07 _Covenant Not to Compete; Non-Solicitation_. (a) Each of the
Sellers covenants and agrees that on and after the Closing until the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), subject
to _Section 15.07(b)_, Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to not, engage, directly or indirectly, in the ownership,
management, operation or control of a business which manufactures and/or
sells Restricted Products (" _Restricted Business_ ") in the United States,
Canada and Mexico.

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
15.07(a)_, SSCE and its Affiliates shall be permitted to, directly or
indirectly:

  

(i) acquire and own not more than five percent (5%) of any class of
securities of any Person listed on a national securities exchange or quoted
on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System
or over-the-counter who operates, manages or controls a Restricted Business;

  

(ii) acquire any Person (whether through the purchase of stock or assets or
by way of merger, consolidation or other transaction) who owns, operates,
manages or controls a Restricted Business so long as the gross revenues of
such acquired Person from the Restricted Business in the most recently
completed fiscal year of such acquired Person do not exceed fifteen percent
(15%) of the gross revenues of such acquired Person; _provided_ ,  _however_
, after the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, SSCE or its
Affiliates shall be permitted to acquire any Person who owns,
operates, manages or controls a Restricted Business regardless of the
revenues or the percentage of revenues such Restricted Business represents of
the acquired Person;

  

(iii) be acquired by any other Person even though such acquiring Person may
own, operate, manage or control a Restricted Business; _provided_ , that in
the event that shareholders of SSCE or its applicable Affiliate do not
receive solely cash in such transaction, this exception shall only apply if
the shareholders of the acquiring third Person will following such
transaction own in excess of 50% of both the voting securities and economic
interests in the surviving entity;

  

(iv) perform their obligations or exercise their rights as set forth under
the Transition Services Agreement; and

  

(v) continue to manufacture, develop and sell corrugated products (other than
Restricted Products) of businesses being operated by SSCE and its Affiliates
as of the date of this Agreement.

     

   



  

### For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers and Purchasers agree that (i) any
joint venture to which SSCE or any of its Affiliates is currently a party
and which SSCE or any of its Affiliates does not control shall not
be subject to the provisions contained in this Agreement and (ii)
neither party to this Agreement shall be prevented from developing,
manufacturing and selling any products (other than Restricted Products, in
the case of the Sellers and their Affiliates) which neither party currently
manufactures or sells. For purposes of the foregoing statement, control shall
mean either ownership of a majority of the voting interests or having the
role of a general partner, managing member or the equivalent in such joint
venture or affiliation with or the right to designate a majority of the
members of a board of directors or a board of managers or control by virtue
of contractual rights to manage or direct such business.

  

### (c) " _Restricted Products_ " shall mean (i) folding carton and coated
recycled board products, (ii) multiwall bags, (iii) labels or (iv)
flexible packaging products.

  

### (d) During the Restricted Period, Sellers will not, and will not permit
any of their respective Affiliates to induce any customers or suppliers of
the Business as of the Closing Date to cease doing business with the
Business, or otherwise interfere with or attempt to interfere with
the business relations of any such Person with Purchaser, its Affiliates or
any successor to the foregoing.

  

### (e) On and after the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Sellers will not, and will not permit any of their
respective Affiliates, to, without the Purchasers prior written consent,
directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage, entice or induce any Person who
is (or was within the prior three months) a Transferred Employee to terminate
their employment with Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the covenant
in this _Section 15.07(e) _shall not restrict Sellers or any of their
Affiliates from employing personnel from the Purchaser who respond to general
solicitations of employment from the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or
who approach Sellers or any of their Affiliates directly and independently.

  

### (f) On and after the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Sellers will not, and will not permit any of their
respective Affiliates, to, without the Purchasers prior written consent,
hire any of the Business Employees listed in _Section 15.07(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule_.

  

### (g) Except as set forth in _Section 15.07(g) of the Disclosure
Schedule_, **** on and after the Closing until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser and any successor to the Business will not, and will
not permit any of their Affiliates to, without SSCEs prior written consent,
directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage, entice or induce any Person who
is (or was within the past three months) an employee of SSCE or its
Affiliates to terminate their employment with SSCE or its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the covenant in this _Section 15.07(f) _shall
not restrict Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from employing personnel from
SSCE or its Affiliates who respond to general solicitations of employment
from the Purchaser or its Affiliates or who approach Purchaser or its
Affiliates directly and independently.

  

### (h) The Restricted Period and the periods referenced in _Section
15.07(e), (f) and (g) _shall be tolled during any period of violation
of these covenants by a party and during

     

   

any other period required for litigation during which a party seeks to
enforce this covenant against any violating party.

  

### (i) In the event that any of the covenants contained in this _Section
15.07_ shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable by reason of its extending for too long a period of time or
over too large a geographical area or by reason of its being too extensive in
any other respect, the covenants contained in this _Section 15.07_ shall be
interpreted to extend only over the longest period of time for which it may
be enforceable, and/or over the largest geographical area as to which it may
be enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other aspects as to which
it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action. The
parties hereto acknowledge that both the length of time and the geographic
scope are considered by them to be reasonable given the nature of the
Business and are necessary to the protection of the goodwill of the Business.

  

### (j) The restrictive covenants contained in this _Section 15.07_ are each
covenants independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the
existence of any claim which a party may allege against any other party
to this Agreement, whether based on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not
prevent the enforcement of these covenants. The Sellers acknowledge that
Purchaser is purchasing the goodwill of the Business and the covenants
contained in this _Section 15.07_ for the benefit of the Purchaser are
essential to the protection of Purchasers investment in the Business and
that Purchaser would not purchase the Business but for these covenants. The
parties hereto agree that a breach by any other party hereto of this _Section
15.07_ shall cause irreparable harm and that the remedies at law for any
breach or threat of breach of the provisions of this _Section 15.07_ shall
be inadequate, and that such party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this _Section 15.07_ and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which such party may be entitled at law.

  

### (k) For income Tax purposes only, the parties hereto agree that a portion
of the Purchase Price shall be allocated to the covenant provided for in this
_Section 15.07_ and such amount shall be included in the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule.

  

15.08 _Sales Alliance_. Subject in all events to compliance with
applicable Law, SSCE and the Purchaser agree to negotiate in good faith a
joint agreement or arrangement following the Closing pursuant to which
certain sales representatives of SSCE and the Business will continue to sell
products of the other party and in return receive reasonable and arms-length
sales commissions.
