balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing, prepared in accordance with the Closing
Balance Sheet Principles and without including any Company Expenses or any
other actual or anticipated adjustments or effects arising from the
transactions contemplated hereby, (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"),
(ii) a schedule calculating the Estimated Net Debt, (iii) a schedule
calculating the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment and (iv) a schedule
calculating the Estimated Company Expenses; _provided_ that, the inventory
reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be based on the
physical count of the inventory conducted by the Company following the year
end (the "Year-End Inventory Count"), which shall be completed at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and may be observed by Buyer
in accordance with Section 5.2.

(b) Within 75 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Sellers Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing, prepared in accordance with the Closing Balance
Sheet Principles and without including any Company Expenses or any other
actual or anticipated adjustments or effects arising from the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Final Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii) a schedule

Working Capital Adjustment and (iv) a schedule calculating the Company
Expenses ((i) through (iv) collectively, the "Final Closing Balance Sheet
Documents"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing occurs on or

13  Business Days following December 31, 2014, (i) "Final Closing Balance Sheet"
shall mean the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2014, and (ii) to the extent that such
unaudited consolidated balance sheet is not prepared in accordance with the
Closing Balance Sheet Principles or does include Company Expenses or any other
actual or anticipated adjustments or effects arising from the transactions
contemplated hereby, any effect of any of the foregoing shall be excluded from
the calculation of the Final Net Debt and the Final Working Capital
Adjustment. The inventory reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet shall
be based on a physical count of the inventory as of the Closing Date to be
commenced by the Company on the Closing Date, which may be observed by Sellers
in accordance with Section 2.4(c); _provided_ that, in the event that the
Closing occurs on or within two Business Days following December 31, 2014, the
inventory reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be based on the
Year-End Inventory Count.

 

(c) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company
to, provide the Sellers and any independent auditors and other
representatives of the Sellers with reasonable access at all reasonable times
to, and opportunity to examine and make copies of, the properties, books,
records, working papers (including those prepared by auditors and other
representatives) and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of reviewing the Final Closing Balance Sheet. The Sellers
Representative shall have 30 days after receipt of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet Documents to dispute all or any portion of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet Documents by written notice to Buyer, setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such dispute. If the Sellers Representative fails to notify
Buyer of any such dispute within such 30-day period, the Final Closing
Balance Sheet Documents shall be final and binding on the parties. In the
event that the Sellers Representative shall so notify the Buyer of any
dispute, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative and their respective
accountants shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly
as possible. Any such written resolution shall be final and binding on the
parties.

 

(d) If Buyer and the Sellers Representative and their respective
accountants are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30 days of the
Sellers Representatives delivery of such dispute notice, such dispute shall
be resolved by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the "Independent Accounting Firm"),
which shall make its determination as promptly as practicable. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall, acting as expert and not as arbitrator,
determine whether and to what extent, if any, the Final Closing Balance Sheet
Documents require adjustment. Of the expenses relating to the engagement of
the Independent Accounting Firm, each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers,
on the other hand, shall bear a fraction equal to (i) the absolute value of
the difference between (A) the Post-Closing Adjustment that would have been
payable under Section 2.4(e) based on the submission of such party (or, in the
case of Sellers, Sellers Representatives on behalf of Sellers) and (B) the
Post-Closing Adjustment payable according to Section 2.4(e) as calculated
based on the Independent Accounting Firms determination _divided by_ (ii) the
sum of the amount calculated in accordance with the preceding clause (i) for
Buyer and the amount calculated in accordance with the preceding clause (i)
for Sellers; _provided_ that, in the event that the Independent Accounting
Firms determination is more favorable to a party than such partys
submission, the other party shall bear all of the costs of the Independent
Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use
every reasonable effort to perform its services within 15 days of submission
of the Final Closing Balance Sheet Documents to it and, in any case, as soon
as

 



14  practicable after submission. The Final Closing Balance Sheet Documents, as
modified by resolution of any dispute by Buyer and the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, or by the Independent Accounting
Firm, shall be final and binding on the parties.

(e) Promptly following the final determination of the Final Net Debt
and the Final Working Capital Adjustment, if the amount equal to the Estimated
Net Debt _less_ the Final Net Debt _plus_ the Final Working Capital Adjustment
_less_ the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment _plus_ the Estimated Company
Expenses _less_ the Company Expenses (the "Post-Closing Adjustment") is a
positive number, Buyer shall pay such amount to the Sellers Representative
for the benefit of the Sellers, and the Sellers Representative and Buyer
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse the Adjustment Escrow
Amount from the Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Sellers. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment is a negative number, Sellers Representative and Buyer
shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer, an amount equal to the absolute
value of the Post-Closing Adjustment from the Adjustment Escrow Amount;
_provided_ that, if the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number and its
absolute value is greater than the balance of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
then available in the Escrow Account, then Sellers Representative and Buyer
shall cause the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Indemnification Escrow
Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Buyer the amount by
which the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds the available
balance of the Adjustment Escrow Amount (up to the available balance of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account). If the amount of the
Post-Closing Adjustment is (i) a negative number and its absolute value is
less than the balance of the Adjusted Escrow Amount available in the Escrow
Account or (ii) equal to zero, then Sellers Representative and Buyer shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Escrow Account by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to Sellers Representative for
the benefit of the Sellers the amount by which the Adjustment Escrow Amount
exceeds the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment. In the event of any
payment according to this Section 2.4(e) from Buyer or the Escrow Agent to
the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Sellers, the Sellers
Representative shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, distribute to each
Seller an amount equal to the product of (i) such payment and (ii) such
Sellers Pro Rata Portion.

 

(f) Any payment under this Section 2.4 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for any Tax purposes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

(g) As soon as practicable following any adjustment of the Purchase
Price under this Section 2.4, the Sellers Representative shall deliver (i) to
each Seller a schedule calculating such Sellers Pro Rata Portion and (ii) to
Buyer a schedule calculating the Pro Rata Portions of all Sellers (the "Pro
Rata Portion Schedule").

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Sellers Representative shall (i) make any adjustment to any distribution to
Sellers under the last sentence of Section 2.4(e), 7.6(a) and/or Section
8.5(e) that is necessary to compensate for any amount by which any payment to
a Seller under the second sentence of Section 2.2(a) exceeded or fell short
of what such Seller would have been entitled to if the Closing Payment had
been distributed in accordance with each Sellers Pro Rata Portion as opposed
to its Closing Price Pro 

 



15  Rata Portion and (ii) provide to each Seller, following each such
distribution, a schedule calculating the adjustment of the payment to such
Seller.

 

Section 2.5 _Sellers  Representative_.

 

(a) Each Seller hereby authorizes and directs the Sellers
Representative as its agent, proxy, attorney-in-fact and representative under
the Transaction Documents to take such action on behalf of such Seller, and to
exercise such rights, power and authority, as are authorized, delegated and
granted to the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement, including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) execution, delivery and
receipt of the Escrow Agreement, (ii) preparation and delivery of the

receive notices and other documentation, pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, on behalf of the Sellers, (iv) amending and waiving the terms of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.9 hereof, but excluding, without the
prior consent of all Sellers, any change that would be inconsistent with the
LLC Agreement, (v) receipt of the Purchase Price and amounts, if any, in the
Escrow Account, on behalf of the Sellers, pursuant to Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2
and distribution thereof to the Sellers in accordance with Section 8.5, (vi)
termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, (vii) settlement
of any claims for which the Sellers may be required to indemnify or pay to,
or entitled to indemnification or payment from, Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement, and (viii) any other actions contemplated by or in furtherance of
this Agreement.

 

(b) Each Seller agrees that (i) the Sellers Representative shall not
be liable for any actions taken or omitted to be taken under or in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for such
actions taken or omitted to be taken resulting from the Sellers
Representatives willful misconduct, (ii) the Sellers Representative shall
not owe any fiduciary duty or have any fiduciary responsibility to any of
Sellers or the Company as a result of any actions taken as the Sellers
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except for such actions taken or
omitted to be taken resulting from the Sellers Representatives willful
misconduct, respectively, and (iii) each Seller, severally and not jointly, in
accordance with such Sellers Pro Rata Portion, shall defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers Representative and its Affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employers and agents from and against all
expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) losses, claims, fines,
liabilities, damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement in respect of
any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on,
arising out of or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a Sellers
Representative hereunder or arising out of acts or omissions of such Person in
such capacity (including in respect of acts or omissions in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) except for, in any
case, acts or omissions which involve conduct known to such Person at the time
to constitute a material violation of Law.

 

(c) Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions
and actions of the Sellers Representative required or permitted to be taken
by the Sellers Representative under any Transaction Document, and no Seller
shall have any cause of action against Buyer or its Affiliates for any action
taken by Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Sellers
Representative.

adverse effect on such Sellers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

authorizations, consents and approvals described in Section 3.1(b) have been
obtained, violate any applicable Law to which such Seller is subject, and
(ii) if such Seller is not an individual, violate the articles of
incorporation, by-laws, limited liability company agreement or such other

Corporation is or may be subject to Tax in any such jurisdiction.

 

(i) The representations in this Section 3.2 constitute the sole
representations and warranties of each Offshore Seller with respect to Tax

foreign entity.

the transactions contemplated thereby will not (i) violate any applicable Law

Section 5.3 _Filings and Authorizations; HSR Act Filing_.

(a) The Company, on the one hand, and Guarantor, on the other hand,
have heretofore each filed a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer,
Guarantor the Company and the Sellers further agrees that it will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, comply with any applicable post-Closing notification
or requirements of any antitrust, trade competition, investment or control
reporting or similar law or regulation of any Governmental Authority with
competent jurisdiction. Each of Buyer, Guarantor, the Company and the Sellers
agree to reasonably cooperate with and promptly to consult with, to provide
any reasonably available information with respect to, and to provide, subject
to appropriate confidentiality provisions, copies of all presentations and
filings to any Governmental Authority to the other party or its counsel.
Further, Guarantor agrees to withdraw and refile its HSR Act notification
prior to the end of the first HSR Act 30-day waiting period, in accordance
with the procedure set forth in 16 C.F.R. 803.12, if reasonably necessary and
advisable to avoid issuance of a Request for Additional Information and
Documentary Material under the HSR Act.

 

(b) In addition to the agreements set forth in (a) above, Buyer and
Guarantor shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the consents,
approvals, waivers or other authorizations from Governmental Authorities,
including without limitation, antitrust clearance under the HSR Act, are
obtained as promptly as practicable, and that any conditions set forth
therein or established by any such Governmental Authorities are wholly
satisfied.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall not be required to (i) defend or contest any action
or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, by any Governmental
Authority, (ii) take any action to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any order of any Governmental Authority, (iii) take any action to
comply with any Governmental Authoritys request for additional information,
or (iv) divest or hold separate any assets, in each case in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.4 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, the Buyer and the Company agree that all
rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor
of any officer, director, managing member, or manager of any member of the
Company Group (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees"), as provided in the
LLC Agreement or in any other organizational document of any member of the
Company Group, or in any employment agreement or indemnification agreement
between a member of the Company Group and any Company Indemnitee shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full
force and effect and be honored by the Company after the Closing. The
obligations of the Company under this Section 5.4(a) shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to
whom this Section 5.4(a) applies without the consent of such affected Company
Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the

 



42  Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.4(a) applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.4(a)). If the Closing occurs, the Company
shall pay all expenses to any Company Indemnitee incurred in successfully
enforcing the indemnity or other obligations provided for in this Section
5.4(a).

 

(b) Prior to Closing, the Sellers Representative, Company and Buyer
will mutually agree on the provider and the terms of an officers and
directors liability tail insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions
occurred prior to or at the closing and covering each person currently covered
by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policies on
terms with respect to coverage and amount not materially less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement. The Company
shall maintain such tail insurance policy for a period of six years following
the Closing. All fees payable by the Company in respect of such tail insurance
policy shall be borne by the Sellers, severally and not jointly, in accordance
with their Pro Rata Portion.

 

Section 5.5 _COBRA_. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company
Group to, be solely responsible for any obligation arising under Section 4980B
of the Code with respect to all "MandA Qualified Beneficiaries" as defined in
Treasury Regulation §54.4980B-9. 

Section 5.6 _Company 401(k) Plan_. The Company shall
terminate, or cause to have terminated, the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date. Each employee of any member of the
Company Group participating in (or eligible to participate in) the Company
401(k) Plan at the time the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated (each, an
"Affected Employee") shall become eligible to participate immediately
following the Closing Date in a 401(k) plan sponsored by the Buyer or one of
its Subsidiaries. All resolutions and other documents issued, adopted or
executed in connection with such termination shall be subject to the Buyers
reasonable prior review and comment. Subject to the terms of the applicable
plan, the Buyer shall cause such Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary 401(k) plan to
accept a direct rollover of eligible rollover distributions (as defined in
Section 402(c)(4) of ERISA), made on behalf of an Affected Employee from the
Company 401(k) plan.

Section 5.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
party hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, but not limited to, (i) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto, (ii) the obtaining
of consents, waivers or approvals of any third parties, (iii) the defending of
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the performance of the obligations hereunder,
except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3(c), and (iv) the execution and
delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions as the
other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of
this Agreement.

 



43 (b) Subject to occurrence of the Closing, the Company and Wasserstein
Partners III, LP as its managing member hereby irrevocably waive any and all
requirements and conditions under the LLC Agreement (other than those
expressly set forth herein) relating to, and irrevocably consent to, (i) the
transfer of any Class A Units or Incentive Units contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) to the admission of Buyer as a member of the Company.

 

Section 5.8 _Affiliate Agreements_. Effective as of the
Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall terminate, or cause to have
terminated, all agreements set forth on Section 3.3(u) of the _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ , without any further right, obligation or liability of
any Person thereunder.

Section 5.9 _Publicity_. Buyer and the Sellers agree to
communicate with each other and cooperate with each other prior to any public
disclosure of this transaction. Buyer and the Sellers Representative agree
that no public release or announcement concerning the terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior consent of Buyer and the Sellers Representative, except as such
release or announcement may be required by Law or any Contract to which any
party is subject, including any stock exchange listing agreements, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the
other parties reasonable time to comment on such release announcement in
advance of such issuance. After the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Sellers
Representative shall not issue or make any public release or announcement
concerning the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consent of Buyer, except as such release or announcement may be required by
law.

 

Section 5.10 _Confidentiality_. Buyer and its Representatives
(as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) shall treat
all information obtained in connection with this Agreement (including in
connection with the access provisions of Section 5.2 hereof) and the
transactions contemplated hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement by and between Wasserstein Partners III
(GP), LP and Guarantor, dated as of October 28, 2014 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), of which the Company is an express third-party beneficiary. The
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference
and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time
such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect.

Section 5.11 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each of
Buyer and the Company, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby fully
and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges (a) each Seller,
(b) each Affiliate of any Seller, and (c) each employee of any Seller or of
any Affiliate of any Seller that serves or has previously served as officer
or director of any member of the Company Group, from any and all manners of
actions, causes of actions, claims, obligations, demands, damages, costs,
expenses, compensation and other relief, whether known or unknown, whether in
law or equity, arising out of, relating to, or accruing from their ownership
of membership interests in the Company and/or their service as officer or
director (as applicable), other than with respect to any Sellers obligations
under this Agreement; 

 



44   _provided_ , however, that this Section 5.11 shall not apply to any

45 ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

Section 7.1 _Purchase Price Allocation._ The parties hereto agree
that, for all Tax purposes, the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the
Class A Units, the Incentive Units, and the Blocker Shares sold by each
Offshore Seller _pro rata_ in accordance with the aggregate Pro Rata Portions
of the Sellers of the Class A Units, the Incentive Units, and such Blocker
Shares, respectively. Each of the parties hereto agrees to file all of such
partys Tax Returns in a manner consistent with this Section 7.1 and shall not
take a contrary position for any Tax purpose unless otherwise required by a
determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code (or similar
state law). Any portion of the Purchase Price that is not allocated to the
Blocker Shares shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in
accordance with Section 755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Section 755 Allocation"). The Section 755
Allocation shall become final and binding on the parties hereto 10 days after
Buyer provides a schedule of the Section 755 Allocation to the
Sellers Representative, unless the Sellers Representative provides a
written objection to Buyer specifying the basis for its objection and
providing an alternative allocation. Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall in good faith attempt to resolve the dispute within 20 days after
receipt by the Buyer of the Sellers Representatives written objection. Any
such resolution shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. If the
parties hereto cannot resolve the dispute within 20 days after Buyers
receipt of Sellers Representatives written objection, the parties hereto
agree to independently allocate any portion of the Purchase Price that is not
allocated to the Blocker Shares among the assets of the Company in accordance
with Section 755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and to each use their own such allocation for all relevant
purposes.

 

Section 7.2 _Post-Closing Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; Tax Indemnification._

(a) _Post-Closing Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries._
Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.5 with respect to Transfer Taxes,
the Sellers Representative, at its expense, shall prepare and timely file or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any period ending on or before the Closing Date, and, unless
and to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, shall cause the
Company to properly elect under Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 IRB 746
to deduct 70% of any success-based fees that are paid by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any such Tax Return that is a Pre-Closing
Period Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
(and, in the case of any such Tax Return that includes the Closing Date, shall
reflect, without limitation, any deduction attributable to amounts paid or
accrued by the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries on or before the
Closing Date, including Company Expenses) unless otherwise required by
applicable Law; provided that the Sellers acknowledge that the Company will,
and that Buyer will cause the Company to, make an election under Section 754
of the Code (and any applicable similar provisions of state or local law) with
respect to the Companys taxable year that includes the Closing Date and that
the Sellers Representative shall prepare all Tax Returns of the Company for
any taxable period ending on the Closing Date consistent with such election,

 



46 whether or not consistent with past practice. Any Tax Returns described in the
immediately preceding sentence shall be submitted by the Sellers
Representative to Buyer for review and comment at least 30 days prior to the
due date (taking into account any applicable extensions) for such Tax Return.
The Sellers Representative shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments provided by Buyer with respect to any such Pre-Closing Period Return.

 

(b) _Apportionment_. When determining the amounts allocated to, and
reported on, any Tax Returns of the Company for any taxable period or portion
thereof that ends on the Closing Date, the parties agree to use the closing of
the books method under Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Taxes of any corporate Subsidiary of the Company for
any Straddle Period shall be apportioned in accordance with Section 7.4.

 

(c) _Amended Returns, Elections, Claims_. Neither the Buyer, nor the
Company, nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries, nor any of their Affiliates
shall file any amended Tax Return for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle Period, or make any election or
claim with respect to any Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle Period of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;
provided that any increase in any Sellers liability under this Article VII
or Section 8.2 or any other provision of this Agreement that could result from
the filing of such an amended Tax Return, election, or claim shall be treated
as adequate reason to withhold consent unless the Buyer Indemnified parties
(as defined in Section 8.2) waive any and all rights to claim indemnification
for Losses against the Sellers with respect to any such filing, election, or
claim.

 

(d) _Straddle Period Returns_. Buyer at its expense shall prepare and
timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period. Each such Straddle
Period Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (and
shall reflect, without limitation, any deduction attributable to amounts paid
or accrued by the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries on or before the
Closing Date, including Company Expenses) unless otherwise required by
applicable Law and shall be submitted by the Buyer to the Sellers
Representative for review and comment at least 30 days prior to the due date
(taking into account any applicable extensions) for such Tax Return. Buyer
shall revise any such Straddle Period Return as reasonably requested by the
Sellers Representative.

(e) _Tax Indemnification_. If the Closing occurs, each Seller,
severally in accordance with its Pro Rata Portion and not jointly, shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties (as defined
in Section 8.2) from and against any and all Losses (as defined in Section
8.2) asserted against or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party relating to,
resulting from, or arising out of:

 

(i) any Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Period or the portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the
Closing Date (as determined pursuant to Section 7.4) except to the extent such
Taxes are reflected in the Final Closing Balance Sheet Documents;

 



47 (ii) any Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any corresponding provision of
state, local or foreign law) as a result of being a member of any federal,
state, local, or foreign consolidated, unitary, combined, or similar group on
or prior to the Closing Date except to the extent such Taxes are reflected in
the Final Closing Balance Sheet Documents; and

 

(iii) any Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period as a transferee or successor by applicable Law, Contract or
otherwise (excluding any lease, loan, or similar commercial agreement the
principal purpose of which is unrelated to Taxes), where the liability of the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary for such Taxes is attributable to a
transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date other than any transaction
occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing has occurred.

Section 7.3 _Post-Closing Tax Returns of the Blocker Corporations;
Tax Indemnification_.

(a) _Post-Closing Tax Returns of the Blocker Corporations_. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 7.5 with respect to Transfer Taxes, each Blocker
Corporation shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, on a
timely basis, all Tax Returns (including any amendments thereto) of such
Blocker Corporation for any period ending on or before the Closing Date. Any
such Tax Return that is a Pre-Closing Period Return shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice (and, in the case of any such Tax Return
that includes the Closing Date, shall reflect, without limitation, any
deduction attributable to amounts paid or accrued by the applicable Blocker
Corporation on or before the Closing Date) unless otherwise required by
applicable Law and shall be submitted by the applicable Blocker Corporation
to the Buyer for review and comment at least 30 days prior to the due date
(taking into account any applicable extensions) for such Tax Return. The
applicable Blocker Corporation shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments provided by Buyer with respect to any such Pre-Closing Period Return.

 

(b) _Amended Returns, Elections, Claims_. Neither the Buyer, nor any
Blocker Corporation, nor any of their Affiliates shall file any amended Tax
Return for any Blocker Corporation for any Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle
Period, or make any election or claim with respect to any Pre-Closing Period
or any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of the Offshore
Seller set forth opposite such Blocker Corporations name on Schedule I, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld; provided that any increase in any
Sellers liability under this Article VII or Section 8.2 or any other
provision of this Agreement that could result from the filing of such an
amended Tax Return, election, or claim shall be treated as adequate reason to
withhold consent unless the Buyer Indemnified parties (as defined in Section
8.2) waive any and all rights to claim indemnification for Losses against the
Sellers with respect to any such filing, election, or claim.

 

(c) _Straddle Period Returns_. The Buyer, at its expense,
shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all
Tax Returns of the Blocker Corporations for any Straddle Period. Each such
Straddle Period Return shall be prepared in a

 



48 manner consistent with past practice (and shall reflect, without limitation,
any deduction attributable to amounts paid or accrued by the applicable
Blocker Corporation on or before the Closing Date) unless otherwise required
by applicable Law and shall be submitted by the Buyer to the Sellers
Representative for review and comment at least 30 days prior to the due date
(taking into account any applicable extensions) for such Tax Return. The Buyer
shall revise any such Straddle Period Return as reasonably requested by the
Sellers Representative.

 

(d) _Payment of Taxes_. Each Offshore Seller shall pay to the Buyer,
within two days before the filing of any Tax Return filed in accordance with
Section 7.3(a), that portion of the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that
is allocable to the Pre-Closing Period or, in the case of a Straddle Period
Return, the portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date as
determined pursuant to Section 7.4, in each case, except to the extent that
the applicable Blocker Corporation has received distributions from the Company
in respect of such Taxes pursuant to Section 6.6 of the LLC Agreement.

(e) _Tax Indemnification_. If the Closing occurs, each Offshore
Seller, solely with respect to the Blocker Corporation set forth opposite such
Offshore Sellers name on Schedule I, severally in accordance with the
percentage of Blocker Shares owned by such Offshore Seller in such Blocker
Corporation and not jointly, shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section 8.2) from and against any and
all Losses (as defined in Section 8.2) asserted against or suffered by any
Buyer Indemnified Party relating to, resulting from, or arising out of:

 

(i) any Taxes imposed on the Blocker Corporation set forth opposite
such Offshore Sellers name on Schedule I for any Pre-Closing Period or the
portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date (as determined
pursuant to Section 7.4);

 

(ii) any Taxes imposed on the Blocker Corporation set forth opposite
such Offshore Sellers name on Schedule I under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign law) as a
result of being a member of any federal, state, local, or foreign
consolidated, unitary, combined, or similar group on or prior to the Closing
Date; and

(iii) any Taxes imposed on the Blocker Corporation set forth opposite
of such Offshore Sellers name on Schedule I with respect to any Person (other
than such Blocker Corporation) imposed on such Blocker Corporation for any
taxable period as a transferee or successor by applicable Law, Contract or
otherwise (excluding any lease, loan, or similar commercial agreement the
principal purpose of which is unrelated to Taxes), where the liability of such
Blocker Corporation for such Taxes is attributable to a transaction occurring
on or before the Closing Date other than any transaction occurring on the
Closing Date after the Closing has occurred.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Offshore Seller shall have any indemnification
obligation under this Section 7.3(e) for any Losses relating to, resulting
from, or arising out of any Taxes imposed

 



49  on any Blocker Corporation other than the Blocker Corporation set forth
opposite such Offshore Sellers name on Schedule I.

 

Section 7.4 _Straddle Periods._ In order to appropriately apportion
any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period for purposes of this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted or required under applicable
Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of
the relevant entity for all Tax purposes. In any case where applicable Law
does not permit the relevant entity to treat the Closing Date as the last day
of the taxable year or period, Taxes of such entity and Taxes relating to the
assets of such entity shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end
at the close of the Closing Date, and the period deemed to begin at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim
closing of the books; provided, however, that (a) Taxes (such as real or
personal property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a
daily basis and (b) any transaction undertaken by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or a Blocker Corporation after the Closing on the Closing Date
that is outside of the ordinary course of business, shall, in the absence of
the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative to the contrary, be
deemed to occur and be taken into account on the day after the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.5 _Transfer Taxes._ All Transfer Taxes (including any costs
and expenses relating thereto) shall be borne by the Buyer regardless of
whether such Transfer Taxes become due or payable on or after the Closing
Date. The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file (or
cause to be timely filed) all Tax Returns required to be filed in respect of
such Transfer Taxes and shall transmit to the appropriate taxing authority the
Transfer Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns; provided that, the Buyer
shall provide a copy of each Tax Return required to be filed in respect of a
Transfer Tax to the Sellers Representative for its review and comment not
later than 30 days prior to filing such Tax Return (taking into account all
applicable extensions), and the Buyer shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments made by the Sellers Representative on such Tax Return.
The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall cooperate and take any action
reasonably requested by the other in order to lawfully minimize such
Transfer Taxes. The Buyer shall provide to the Sellers Representative a true
and complete copy of each such Tax Return as filed and evidence of the timely
filing thereof.

 

Section 7.6 _Refunds and Credits_.

 

(a) Any after-tax portion of any refund or credit of any Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries attributable to any Pre-Closing Period or
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be for the
account of the Sellers and Buyer shall pay an amount equal to such after-tax
portion to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Sellers in
immediately available funds within five days after the receipt of such refund
or credit by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates and, as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Sellers Representative shall distribute such amount to the
Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions. Upon the reasonable
written request of the Sellers Representative, the Buyer shall prepare and
file any amended Tax Return or claim for refund or credit of Taxes with
respect to any Pre-Closing Period; provided that (a) doing so will have no
adverse effect on the Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date, (b) the Sellers pay all out-of-
pocket expenses and costs of such preparation and filing, and (c) such
amended Tax

 



50 Return or claim is supportable by the requisite standard under applicable Law
to avoid material penalty or other sanction. Any refund or credit of Taxes of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning after
the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Buyer.

 

(b) Any after-tax portion of any refund or credit of any Taxes of the
any Blocker Corporation attributable to any Pre-Closing Period or the portion
of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be for the account of
the Offshore Seller set forth opposite such Blocker Corporations name on
Schedule I and Buyer shall cause the applicable Blocker Corporation to pay an
amount equal to such after-tax portion to the applicable Offshore Seller in
immediately available funds within five days after such Blocker Corporations
receipt of such refund or credit. Upon the reasonable written request of an
Offshore Seller, the Blocker Corporation set forth opposite such Offshore
Sellers name on Schedule I shall prepare and file any amended Tax Return or
claim for refund or credit of Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Period;
provided that (a) doing so will have no adverse effect on the Blocker
Corporation for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, (b) the
applicable Offshore Seller pays all out-of-pocket expenses and costs of such
preparation and filing, and (c) such amended Tax Return or claim is
supportable by the requisite standard under applicable Law to avoid material
penalty or other sanction. Any refund or credit of Taxes of any Blocker
Corporation for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date shall be
for the account of such Blocker Corporation.

 

Section 7.7 _Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Contests_.

 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries, each Blocker Corporation,
the Buyer, and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Article VII and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Tax matters (any such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding, a "Tax Contest") for which any Seller may have liability pursuant
to this Article VII or Section 8.2. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries, each Blocker Corporation,
the Buyer, and the Sellers agree to retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each
Blocker Corporation relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by the Buyer or the Sellers, any extensions
thereof) for such taxable period, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority.

 

(b) The procedures set forth in Section 7.7(c) and in Section 8.4(a)
(concerning notice of Third Party Claims) shall govern the parties
respective rights and obligations regarding the handling of any Tax Contest
with respect to which any Seller may have liability pursuant to this Article
VII or Section 8.2.

 

(c) Buyer shall be entitled to control any Tax Contest relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Blocker
Corporation except that

 



51  (a) Sellers Representative shall be entitled to control any Tax Contest
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Period and (b) each Offshore Seller shall be entitled to
control any Tax Contest relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Blocker
Corporation set forth opposite its name on _Schedule I_ for any Pre-Closing
Period. Sellers Representative shall be entitled to fully participate in
that portion of any Tax Contest relating to Taxes or Tax Returns for any
Straddle Period for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
which any Seller may incur liability and each Offshore Seller shall be
entitled to fully participate in that portion of any Tax Contest relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns for any Straddle Period for the Blocker Corporation set
forth opposite such Offshore Sellers name on _Schedule I_ with respect to
which such Offshore Seller may incur liability. For purposes of this Section
7.7(c), the term "participation" shall include, to the extent lawfully
possible under applicable Law, (1) participation in conferences, meetings
or proceedings with any taxing authority, the subject matter of which
includes an item for which such party may have liability hereunder, (2)
participation in appearances before any court or tribunal, the subject matter
of which includes an item for which a party may have liability hereunder, and
with respect to the matters described in the preceding clauses (1) and (2),
participation in the submission and determination of the content of the
documentation, protests, memorandum of fact and law, briefs, and the conduct
of oral arguments and presentations. Each party shall execute such consents
and other documents, including power of attorney forms, as required by
applicable Law, to permit, to the extent lawfully possible under applicable
Law, the participation provided for by this Section 7.7(c). Each party shall
bear its own costs and expenses with respect to any Tax Contest or
participation therein. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
no Buyer Indemnified Party shall settle, agree to any deficiency, or consent
to any judgment with respect to any Tax matter for which any Seller may have
liability without the prior written consent of (A) in the case of a Tax matter
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Sellers
Representative or (B) in the case of a Tax matter relating to a Blocker
Corporation, the Offshore Seller opposite such Blocker Corporations name on
_Schedule I_ , in each case which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed . If, pursuant to this Section 7.7(c), Buyer is
entitled to control a Tax Contest regarding a matter for which any Seller may
have liability under this Article VII or Section 8.2, the Sellers
Representative may require the Buyer to contest such matter in an
administrative or judicial proceeding, provided that, in such case, the
Sellers shall be responsible for the proportionate costs and
expenses associated with the matter for which the Sellers may be liable.

Section 7.8 Dispute Resolution for Tax Matters. The parties shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute relating to Taxes or any
liability with respect to Tax matters under this Article VII. If the parties
are unable to resolve any such dispute (other than any dispute arising under
Section 7.1, which shall be governed by Section 7.1), the parties shall submit
the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, which
resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties; provided,
however, that no submission to the Independent Accounting Firm shall be made
with respect to a matter that is the subject of a dispute while a Tax Contest
related thereto is ongoing, or when a final, binding determination resulting
from such Tax Contest itself resolved the matter that was the basis for the
dispute. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer
and the Sellers shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm.

 



52 Section 7.9 _Dissolution of HiP International Sales Company Inc._ The
Company will dissolve HiP International Sales Company Inc. on or before the
Closing Date.

 

Section 7.10 _Treatment of Payments._ Unless and to the
extent otherwise required by applicable law, all indemnification payments
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes as
adjustments to the purchase price of the applicable Class A Units, Incentive
Units, or Blocker Shares. 

ARTICLE VIII

 

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW

 

Section 8.1 _Survival_. All representations and warranties in
this Agreement shall survive until the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
except for those set forth in Section 3.1(a), (b), and (c), Section 3.2,
Section 3.3 (a), (b), (c), (d), (j) and (s), Section 3.4(a), (b) and (c) and
Section 3.5(a) and (b) (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations"),
which shall survive until the date that is 18 months following the Closing
Date. All covenants and other agreements shall survive until the later of (i)
the time such covenant or agreement is to be performed and (ii) the first
anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , however, that Sellers
indemnification obligations under Section 7.2(e) and 7.3(e) shall survive
until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if (i) an Indemnified Party has given an Indemnifying Party written
notice of a claim for indemnification setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim, and (ii) such notice is given prior to expiration of the
survival period applicable to the representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements underlying such claim, then such representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements (as applicable) shall survive,
solely with respect to such claim, until such claim has been fully resolved.

 

Section 8.2 _Obligations of Sellers_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 8.2(b) and (c), if the Closing occurs, each
Seller agrees, severally in accordance with its Pro Rata Portion and not
jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company) and their respective directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, damages (excluding
incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages, except to the extent
awarded to a third party that is not an Affiliate of any Buyer Indemnified
Party), liabilities, claims, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), interest, penalties, judgments and settlements
(collectively, "Losses") incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party by reason
of: (i) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by the
Company or any of the Sellers in this Agreement, (A) in the case of any
representation or warranty made as of a specific date, as of such date,
and (B) in the case of all other representations or warranties, as of the
date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date, (ii) any breach or
nonperformance of any of the covenants, or agreements made by or of the
Company or any of the Sellers in this Agreement or (iii) (A) any Company
Expenses not otherwise borne by Sellers or (B) a Sellers claim that it has
not received the portion of the Purchase Price to which it is entitled under
the LLC Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Losses
relating to the matters described in

 



53  Section 8.2(a)(i), "Losses" shall exclude any amounts attributable to any
claim or set of related claims that do not exceed $25,000 (twenty-five
thousand U.S. Dollars) individually or in the aggregate (but shall include
the entire amount of such claim or set of related claims in the event that
such claim or set of related claims individually or in the aggregate exceeds
$25,000); _provided_ , however, that such limitation shall not apply in the
case of any Losses resulting from a breach of any Fundamental Representations
or the matters described in Section 7.2(e), Section 7.3(e), Section
8.2(a)(ii), and Section 8.2(a)(iii).

 

(b) The Sellers shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for any Losses (i) relating to the matters described in Section 8.2(a) unless
such Losses exceed an aggregate amount equal to $1,000,000 (one million U.S.
Dollars) (the "Deductible Amount") and then only for Losses in excess of
the Deductible Amount and (ii) in excess of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
(the "Cap"); _provided_ , however, that, (A) the Deductible and the Cap shall
not apply in the case of any Losses resulting from a breach of
any Fundamental Representations, (B) the Deductible shall not apply to any
matters described in Section 7.2(e), Section 7.3(e), Section 8.2(a)(ii) or
Section 8.2(a)(iii), and (C) the Cap shall not apply to any matters described
in Section 7.2(e), Section 7.3(e) or Section 8.2(a)(iii). Except with respect
to any Losses resulting from fraud or the breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 3.1(c), Buyers only recourse with respect to
any indemnification claims under this Agreement shall be against the balance
of the Escrow Account until such balance is zero, at which point Buyer may
pursue such claims directly against such Sellers, subject to the
limitations provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyers right to
pursue claims directly against Sellers set forth in the preceding sentence
shall not, in any way, operate to create a liability or obligation on the part
of any Seller that would not exist if the balance of the Escrow Account were
not zero.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the aggregate
liability of each Seller with respect to indemnification obligations under
this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to the product of (i) such
Sellers Pro Rata Portion and (ii) the Purchase Price.

Section 8.3 _Obligations of Buyer and Guarantor_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, (i) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers and their respective directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Losses incurred by any
Seller Indemnified Party by reason of: (A) any breach as of the date of this
Agreement or as of the Closing Date of any of the representations or
warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement, (B) any breach or nonperformance
of any of the covenants or agreements made by Buyer in this Agreement, or (C)
any failure of Buyer to pay for Transfer Taxes for which it is responsible
pursuant to Section 7.5, and (ii) Guarantor agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses incurred
by any Seller Indemnified Party by reason of (A) any breach as of the date of
this Agreement or as of the Closing Date of any of the representations or
warranties made by Guarantor in this Agreement, or (B) any breach
or nonperformance of any of the covenants or agreements made by Guarantor in
this Agreement.

 



54 (b) In the event that Buyer or Guarantor is obligated to make an
indemnification payment hereunder, such payment shall be made to the Sellers
Representative for the benefit of the applicable Seller Indemnified Parties
for distribution thereto.

 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that any action, proceeding, complaint or litigation
is commenced by a third party involving a claim for which a party required to
provide indemnity hereunder (an "Indemnifying Party") may be liable to a party
entitled to indemnification (an "Indemnified Party") hereunder (an "Asserted
Liability"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of such Asserted Liability (the "Claim Notice"); _provided_
that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such Claim
Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such delay.

 

(b) Except with respect to Tax Contests, which shall be governed by
Section 7.7, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days (or less if the nature
of the Asserted Liability requires) from its receipt of the Claim Notice (the
"Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the
Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense
and by counsel of its own choosing, which shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, to defend against such Asserted Liability; _provided_
that if, under applicable standards of professional conduct a conflict on any
significant issue between the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party
exists in respect of such Asserted Liability, then the Indemnifying Party
shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the reasonable fees and expenses of
one additional counsel to be retained in order to resolve such conflict,
promptly upon presentation by the Indemnified Party of invoices or other
documentation evidencing such amounts to be reimbursed. If the Indemnifying
Party undertakes to defend against such Asserted Liability, (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall use its reasonable efforts to defend and protect the
interests of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Asserted
Liability, (ii) the Indemnified Party, prior to or during the period in which
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such matter, may take such
reasonable actions as the Indemnified Party deems necessary to preserve any
and all rights with respect to such matter, without such actions being
construed as a waiver of the Indemnified Partys rights to defense and
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
consent to any settlement which (A) does not contain an unconditional release
of the Indemnified Party from the subject matter of the settlement and (B)
imposes any liabilities or obligations on the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend against such Asserted Liability, the
Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in the investigation, defense and settlement thereof. If the
Indemnified Party desires to participate in any such defense it may do so at
its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake within
the Notice Period to defend against such Asserted Liability, then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in any such defense at
its sole cost and expense, but, in such case, the Indemnified Party shall
control the investigation and defense and may settle or take any other actions
the Indemnified Party deems reasonably advisable without in any way waiving
or otherwise affecting the Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
agree to make available to each other, their counsel and
other representatives, all information and documents

 



55  available to them which relate to such claim or demand. The Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Company and its employees also agree
to render to each other such assistance and cooperation as may reasonably be
required to ensure the proper and adequate defense of such claim or demand.

 

(c) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount
of the indemnified Losses shall not be duplicative of any other Loss for
which an indemnification claim has been made and shall be computed net of (i)
payments actually recovered by the Indemnified Party or the Company under any
insurance policy with respect to such Losses, (ii) any prior or subsequent
recovery by the Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to such Losses,
(iii) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party or the
Company with respect to such Losses and (iv) any reserves set forth with
respect to such Losses on the Financial Statements. In the event of the
occurrence of any Loss, an Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to seek recovery under any applicable insurance policies and against
any other Persons responsible therefor. To the extent that an Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates receives any such recovery after an indemnification
payment by the Indemnifying Party has been made, then such Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
such indemnification payment.

 

(d) In no event shall any claim for indemnification be made under any
provision of this Agreement after the expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in Section 8.1.

 

(e) Except in the case of any claim of fraud, the indemnification
provisions set forth in Section 7.2(e), Section 7.3(e), Section 8.2(a), and
Section 8.3(a) shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties,
from and after the Closing Date, with respect to any breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.5 _Indemnification Escrow Amount_.

 

(a) In order to effectuate payment of any claim of Buyer for any Buyer
Indemnified Party under Section 7.2(e), Section 7.3(e) or Section 8.2 that
has been finally determined by (i) mutual agreement of Buyer and the Sellers
Representative or (ii) final, non-appealable award in accordance with Section
9.3, Sellers Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay from the balance of the Indemnification Escrow Amount then
available in the Escrow Account, an amount equal to such claim to Buyer in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) On the day that is six months following the Closing Date or,
if such day is not a Business Day, on the immediately following Business Day,
an amount equal to (i) $4,000,000 (four million U.S. Dollars) of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount less any amount previously disbursed to Buyer in
accordance with Section 8.5(a), plus (ii) any interest earned on, or other
investment proceeds from, the amount specified in the immediately preceding
clause (i) shall be disbursed to the Sellers Representative for the benefit
of the Sellers. 

(c) On the day that is 15 months following the Closing Date or, if such
day is not a Business Day, on the immediately following Business Day, the
then remaining

 



56  balance of the Indemnification Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account shall be
disbursed to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Sellers.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.5, if,
at the time any disbursement to the Sellers is due under Section 8.5(b) or
(c), any claim for indemnification under Section 7.2(e), Section 7.3(e) or
Section 8.2 of which a Buyer Indemnified Party has notified Sellers
Representative in writing has neither been satisfied nor been denied in full
by final, non-appealable determination in accordance with Section 9.3, then
the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to withhold from the amount otherwise to be disbursed to Sellers under this
Section 8.5 an amount equal to the amount of such claim. Promptly upon final,
non-appealable determination of such claim in accordance with Section 9.3, the
withheld amount shall be disbursed (i) if it has been finally determined that
Buyer is entitled to indemnification in full, to Buyer, or (ii) if it has been
finally determined that Buyer is not entitled to any indemnification, to
Sellers Representative on behalf of Sellers, or (iii) if it has been finally
determined that Buyer is entitled to indemnification for only a portion of its
claim, to Buyer in such portion, and the remainder of such withheld amount to
Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Sellers.

(e) As soon as practicable following receipt by the
Sellers Representative of any amount under this Section 8.5, the Sellers
Representative shall distribute to each Seller an amount equal to the product
of (i) such amount and (ii) such Sellers Pro Rata Portion.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.5, in
the event that any amount from the Indemnification Escrow Amount has been
previously disbursed to Buyer or is withheld from disbursement to the Sellers
in accordance with Section 8.5(d), in each case on the basis of a claim of any
Buyer Indemnified Party against a particular Seller (a "Particular Seller")
for a breach of a representation in Section 3.1 or 3.2, or for breach of a
covenant or other agreement of such particular Seller, or for indemnification
under Section 7.3(e) (each, a "Particular Seller Claim"), any disbursement
under Section 8.5(e) to such Particular Seller shall be reduced by the amount
of such disbursement to Buyer or withholding from disbursement to the Sellers,
which amount shall instead be disbursed to all other Sellers in accordance
with their Pro Rata Portion. Except to the extent that a Particular Seller
Claim can be satisfied solely from the applicable Particular Sellers Pro Rata
Portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount (before deducting the amount
payable in respect of such Particular Seller Claim), such Particular Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless all other Sellers from any Losses resulting
from the applicable Particular Seller Claim.

(g) All matters relating to the Escrow Account, to the extent not
referred to in this Agreement, shall be governed by the Escrow Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event of any conflict between the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
be controlling. The Escrow Agent shall hold, invest, reinvest and disburse
the Indemnification Escrow Amount and Adjustment Escrow Amount in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account shall not be used for any
purpose other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the Escrow
Agreement. All fees payable to the Escrow Agent shall be borne by Buyer.

exhibits and schedules hereto) and the Escrow Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof

which shall survive and remain in effect until expiration or termination
thereof in accordance with its terms and this Agreement.

Section 9.8 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made to an
Article, Section or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article, Section
or Schedule of or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the

60 Section 9.9 _Waiver and Amendment_. Any provisions of this Agreement

sole benefit of (a) the parties hereto and their permitted assigns, (b) the
Buyer Indemnified Parties and (c) the Seller Indemnified Parties (in the case

and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Sellers, the
Company or Buyer, as the case may be, money damages may be inadequate and the

Sellers, the Company and Buyer agree that each of them shall have the right,
in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce
its rights and obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for
damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive,

Section 9.14 _Privilege; Counsel_. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP ("Skadden") has been engaged by Wasserstein Partners III, LP and its
Affiliates to represent them in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of Buyer and the Company (on its behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates) hereby (a) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company), on the one hand, and any of the Sellers and/or Sellers
Representative, on the other hand, Skadden may represent any of the Sellers
and/or the Sellers Representative in such dispute even though the interests
of the Sellers and/or the Sellers Representative may be directly adverse to
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates and even though
Skadden may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to
such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer or the Company, and
(b) waives any conflict in connection therewith. Each of Buyer and the
Company (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further agrees that,

 



61  notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as to all
communications among Skadden, any member of the Company Group and/or the
Sellers (including any of the respective directors, officers and employees of
any of the foregoing) that relate in any way to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the Sellers and shall be
controlled by the Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates. Each of Buyer and the Company
(on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees
that the parties have each undertaken commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent the disclosure of confidential or attorney-client privileged
information. Notwithstanding those efforts, each of Buyer and the Company (on
its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees
that the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby may result in
the inadvertent disclosure of information that may be confidential and/or
subject to a claim of privilege. Each of Buyer and the Company (on its behalf
and on behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees that any
disclosure of information that may be confidential and/or subject to a claim
of privilege will not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim
of privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates and a
third party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Skadden to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Sellerss Representative. Skadden shall be a third
party beneficiary for purposes of this Section 9.14.

Section 9.15 _Guaranty Regarding Buyer s Obligations_. Guarantor, an
Affiliate of Buyer, to induce the Company and Sellers to enter into this
Agreement, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the
full and prompt payment and performance when due of any and all of Buyers
obligations, covenants, agreements and other liabilities under this Agreement.
Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Company and Sellers refuse to
enter into this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein unless Guarantor provides this guaranty and that Guarantor will benefit
personally from the Company and Sellers entering into this Agreement and
consummating such transactions. Guarantor agrees that this guaranty may be
enforced by Sellers Representative (on behalf of Sellers) without the
necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any other remedy against
Buyer. This guaranty will automatically expire and be of no further force or
effect upon the later of (a) the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (b)
final, non-appealable resolution of any claim for indemnification against
Buyer pending as of such first anniversary.
