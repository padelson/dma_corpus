among Argos Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Argos Merger Sub
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and Petsmart, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company.

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively,
to enter into this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, the Equity Investors (other than the Rollover Investor) are
entering into the Termination Fee Commitment Letters with the Company and
Parent, dated as of the date hereof, with respect to certain obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, Longview Asset Management LLC (the "Rollover Investor"),
has entered into a (i) rollover equity commitment letter (the "Rollover
Agreement"), included in Annex II hereof, with Parent pursuant to which the
Rollover Investor has agreed to cause certain Shares to be transferred and
contributed to Parent or an Affiliate thereof immediately prior to the
Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and (ii) as set
forth in Annex IV, a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") with Parent and
the Company, pursuant to which the Rollover Investor has agreed to, among
other things, vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein.

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

 

Article I 
THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
cease and the Company will continue its corporate existence under Delaware law
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street,
New York, New York at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date which shall be
the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions to
be taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent
may agree in writing; provided that if the Marketing Period has not ended at
the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions), the Closing shall occur on the earlier of (x) a date
during the Marketing Period specified by Parent in writing on no fewer than
three Business Days' notice to the Company (it being understood that such date
may be  

 

​

 

 

conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of the financing of the
transactions by Parent and Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement and, if
such financings are not completed for any reason at such time, such notice
shall automatically be deemed withdrawn) and (y) the first Business Day
immediately following the last day of the Marketing Period. The date on which
the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

 

Section 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The
Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in
writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL
(the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time").

 

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. Subject to Section 5.9, at the Effective Time, (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended so as to read in
its entirety in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A and, as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law; and (b) the bylaws of
the Company shall be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B hereto, and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

 

Section 1.6 Directors. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub
as of the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

 

Section 1.7 Officers. The officers of the Company as of the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time
and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

Article II 
CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 

(a) Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001
per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such shares, collectively, the "Common Stock," and each, a "Share"), other
than Shares to be cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), and other
than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive $83.00 in cash (the "Merger
Consideration"). All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates or Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration (in each case,
less any applicable withholding Taxes as provided in Section 2.2(b)(iii)). The
foregoing notwithstanding, if between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the Company (subject to compliance with Section 5.1) changes
the outstanding Shares into a different number of shares or a different class,
by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar
event shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein that is
based upon the number of Shares will be appropriately adjusted to provide to
Parent and the holders of Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. As provided in Section
2.2(b)(iii), the right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any required
withholding under applicable Tax Law.

​

 

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares. Each Share that is owned directly by
the Company, Parent, any direct or indirect holding company of Parent
(including any Share actually contributed pursuant to a "rollover" agreement
between Parent or its Affiliates and the holder of such Share (including the
Rollover Agreement)), or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the "Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
cancellation and retirement. Each Share that is owned directly by any
Subsidiary of the Company (the "Converted Shares") shall be converted into
such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation so as to
maintain relative ownership percentages.

 

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) Dissenters' Rights. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Converted Shares) and
that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have
properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with,
and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares")
will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and had become exchangeable for, at
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for
payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time,
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided
in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by
the Company relating to appraisal demands and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices
and demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such demands.

 

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be
appointed by Parent to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance
by the Company in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) (the "Paying Agent"), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares (other than the Cancelled Shares, the Converted Shares
and the Dissenting Shares), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares, the
Converted Shares and the Dissenting Shares), payable upon due surrender of the
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares
("Certificates") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") pursuant
to the provisions of this Article II (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"). With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall
only be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent
cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in exchange for any such
Dissenting Shares if the holder thereof fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its right to appraisal under the DGCL.

(b) Payment Procedures.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares that immediately
prior to the Effective Time were represented by Certificates and whose Shares
were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a
letter of transmittal with respect to Book-Entry Shares (to the extent
applicable) and Certificates (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares represented by such holder's properly surrendered Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (y) the
Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day following the
Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of Book-
Entry Shares a check or wire transfer for an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares that are such Book-Entry Shares and (y)
the Merger Consideration, without such holder being required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such
Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent or such Book-Entry
Share shall be properly transferred, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other
applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant
Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures
in Section 2.2(b), they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the
proper amount pursuant to this Article II.

 

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the
former holders of Shares one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation or Parent upon demand, and any former
holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with
this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

 

(e) No Liability. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable

 

 

 

-4-  

 

​

 

 

abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by stockholders of the Company as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent (or at Parent's election, the
Surviving Corporation) free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; provided,
however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

 

(g) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number
of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied
by the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.3 Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof between any
holder and Parent (with a copy of any such writing provided to the Company
contemporaneously), each option to purchase Shares (each, a "Company Option"),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per Share of such Company Option by (ii) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Option. The Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company
Options the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment, within five calendar days following the Effective Time.

 

(b) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof between any
holder and Parent (with a copy of any such writing provided to the Company
contemporaneously), each award of restricted stock units that corresponds to
Shares (each, a "Company RSU Award"), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the Merger
Consideration. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company RSU Awards the cash amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within
five calendar days following the Effective Time.

 

(c) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof between any
holder and Parent (with a copy of any such writing provided to the Company
contemporaneously), each performance stock unit award that corresponds to
Shares (each, a "Company PSU Award") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become fully vested by virtue of this Agreement and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof and be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company PSU Award
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration. For purposes of clause (i) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the total number of Shares subject to a
Company PSU Award shall be determined (A) for Company PSU Awards whose
performance period ends prior to the Effective Time, based on actual
performance through the end of such performance period, (B) for Company PSU
Awards granted in fiscal year 2013, at 109.6% of target levels and (C) for
Company PSU Awards granted in fiscal year 2014, at 150.0% of target levels.
The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay
to the holders of Company PSU Awards the cash amounts described in the first
sentence of this Section 2.3(c), less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within five
calendar days following the Effective Time.

(d) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof between any
holder and Parent (with a copy of any such writing provided to the Company
contemporaneously), effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then-outstanding restricted Share (the "Company Restricted Stock") shall
automatically become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall lapse,
and each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Restricted Stock the cash
amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any other applicable
Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within five calendar days
following the Effective Time.

 

(e) Where holders of Company RSU Awards, Company PSU Awards or Company
Restricted Stock are entitled to dividends in respect of such awards,
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all such dividends
corresponding to such awards shall vest and the Surviving Corporation or one
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of such awards
the cash amounts in respect of such dividends, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any other applicable Tax
Law with respect to the making of such payment, within five calendar days
following the Effective Time. For Company PSU Awards, the total number of
Shares with respect to which dividends shall be payable shall be determined
(i) for Company PSU Awards whose performance period ends prior to the
Effective Time, based on actual performance through the end of such
performance period, (ii) for Company PSU Awards granted in fiscal year 2013,
at 109.6% of target levels and (iii) for Company PSU Awards granted in fiscal
year 2014, at 150.0% of target levels.

 

(f) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions necessary
to terminate the Company's 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company
ESPP") and all outstanding rights thereunder as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that, from and after the date hereof, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to (i) not commence a new offering period and
(ii) ensure that no new participants be permitted into the Company ESPP and
that the existing participants thereunder may not increase their elections
with respect to the current offering period. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any then outstanding rights under the Company ESPP shall
terminate and the Company shall distribute to each participant in the Company
ESPP all of his or her accumulated payroll deductions with respect to the
offering period then in effect (if any).

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions as
may reasonably be required in its discretion to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this Section 2.3.

event, item or occurrence in such section or subsection to such other section
or subsection is reasonably apparent), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

Section 3.1 Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc.

-6-  

 

​

 

 

conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available
to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificates of incorporation (or
equivalent formation document) and bylaws (or equivalent formation document)
for the Company and its Subsidiaries, each as amended to the date of this
Agreement and each as so made available is in full force and effect on the
date of this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not in violation
of any provision of their respective organization or governing documents,
except for any violation that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement,
"Company Material Adverse Effect" means a change, event, development or effect
that (a) is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the
business, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (b) prevents, or would
reasonably be expected to prevent, the Company's ability to consummate the
Merger prior to the End Date, but for purposes of clause (a) shall not include
changes, events, developments or effects relating to or resulting from (i)
changes or developments in economic or political conditions or in securities,
credit or financial markets, (ii) changes or developments in or affecting the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, including

identity of Parent or any of its Affiliates as the acquiror of the Company, or
its or their plans for the Company, (v) the omission to take any action
expressly prohibited by clauses (i) through (xvi) of Section 5.1(b) if, prior
to the relevant omission to take any such action, the Company seeks in writing
the prior approval of Parent to take such action which Parent declines to
provide, or the taking of any action required by this Agreement or any action
or inaction expressly consented to by Parent, (vi) any acts of terrorism or
war, (vii) any hurricane, tornado, flood, earthquake, natural disasters, acts
of God or other comparable events, (viii) changes in generally accepted
accounting principles or the interpretation thereof, (ix) any shareholder
litigation relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
or (x) any failure to meet internal or published projections, forecasts or
revenue or earning predictions for any period, or any decline in the market
price or trading volume of the Common Stock (provided that, in the case of
this clause (x), the facts changes, events, developments or effects underlying
any such failure or decline may be taken into account in determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred), except in the case of clauses
(i), (ii), (vi), (vii) and (viii) to the extent that the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are disproportionately adversely affected
relative to other participants in the industries in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries conduct their business, in which case such change, event,
development or effect may be taken into account in determining whether a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" has occurred.

other equity interests in, each of the Company's Subsidiaries have been
validly issued and are owned by the Company, by another wholly-owned

otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or other equity
interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws. The
Company owns the shares of MMI Holdings Inc. as set forth on Section 3.1(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, which represents the ownership percentage set

interests in, the Company's Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or

of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the

 

 

 

-9-  

 

​

 

 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. As of the date filed with or furnished to
the SEC, none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date

the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and

consolidated results of their operations, their consolidated cash flows and
changes in stockholders' equity for the respective periods then ended
(subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein, including the
notes thereto) and were prepared in all material respects in conformity with
GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, as permitted
by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except

maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company's management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended February 2, 2014, and
such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and did not
identify (i) any material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial
reporting and (ii) any allegation of fraud that involves management of the
Company or any other employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have a
significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting
or disclosure controls and procedures. Since February 2, 2014, to the

Subsidiaries or the notes thereto), (b) as incurred after the date of this
Agreement as a result of actions or inactions expressly permitted or required
by this Agreement, (c) for liabilities that have been discharged or paid in
full prior to the date hereof, (d) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any liabilities, commitments
or obligations of any nature (whether asserted, known, accrued, matured,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Law binding upon or applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets, or (iii) result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material
obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any loan, guarantee of
indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,

date of this Agreement, assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1 and 6.3 and completion of the Marketing Period, Parent does not
have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment
Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have Knowledge as of
the date of this Agreement that any of the Lenders or the Equity Investors
will not perform its obligations thereunder.

other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters

Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.

 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent or any
Affiliate or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any
of Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations hereunder.

execution of this Agreement, Parent, the Company and the Equity Investors
(other than the Rollover Investor) have entered into the termination fee

basis, determined in accordance with GAAP;

 

(c) the capital of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on a

intangible), in their entirety, of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller,
within a commercially reasonable period of time, each having reasonable
knowledge of the relevant facts, with neither being under any compulsion to
act.

 

(ii) "Present Fair Salable Value" means the amount that could be obtained by
an independent willing seller from an independent willing buyer if the assets

conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises insofar as such
conditions can be reasonably evaluated.

 

(iii) The amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as
the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at

actual or matured liability.

the Company pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreements to all actions by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Investors and their respective Representatives
expressly permitted by this Agreement. The Company agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreements are hereby amended, as applicable, to permit
(subject to Sections 5.1(c) and 5.12) the inclusion of all prospective debt or

Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an
Alternative Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information regarding the

​

 

 

(b) Anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company
receives an unsolicited Alternative Proposal from a third party made after the
date of this Agreement which in the good faith judgment of the board of
directors of the Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal being made, the Company may take the
following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making
such Alternative Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement having
provisions as to confidential treatment of information that are substantially
similar to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements;
provided that any such nonpublic information provided to such third party
shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, be provided to Parent
prior to or at substantially the same time as it being provided to such third
party, and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with
respect to the Alternative Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours) orally and in writing notify Parent of
any Alternative Proposal received by the Company, which notice shall identify
the name of the Person making such Alternative Proposal and the material terms
and conditions thereof, and include copies of any written proposal relating
thereto provided to the Company or any of its Representatives and indicate
whether the Company has furnished nonpublic information to, or entered into
discussions or negotiations with, such third party. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material
developments regarding any Alternative Proposals or any material change to the
terms of any such Alternative Proposal.

Company shall not (i) withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner
adverse to Parent, the Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or declare
advisable (or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable) any
Alternative Proposal or (iii) fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or fail to recommend against any Alternative Proposal subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in any solicitation or recommendation
statement on Schedule 14D-9 after the commencement of such Alternative
Proposal (any such action, a "Change of Recommendation"). Anything to the
contrary set forth in this Section 5.3 notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the Company may, in
response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company after the date of this
Agreement on an unsolicited basis, (x) make a Change of Recommendation or (y)
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g);
provided, however, that the board of directors of the Company shall not be
entitled to make such a Change of Recommendation or cause any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) until (A) the Company sends written
notice (a "Superior Proposal Notice") to Parent advising Parent that the board
of directors of the Company intends to make such a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) and specifying the reasons
therefor, which notice shall include a description of the terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the
board of directors of the Company, the identity of the Person making the
proposal and a copy of any written proposals or proposed definitive agreements
(including relating to any debt or equity financing) for such Superior
Proposal, if any, (B) during the three Business Day period following the date
on which the Superior Proposal Notice is received, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, use commercially reasonably efforts to
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate), to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and (C) following the end of such three Business Day period, the board of
directors of the Company, after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside legal counsel and taking in account any revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent, shall have
determined in good faith that the Alternative Proposal remains a Superior
Proposal; provided, that each time material modifications to the terms of an
Alternative Proposal determined to be Superior Proposal are made (it being
understood any change to the consideration to be received by the Company's
stockholders in such proposal shall be deemed a material modification), the
Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time period set forth
in the preceding clause (B) shall recommence and be extended for two (2)
Business Days from the day of such notification.

 

(d) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the
Company may, solely in response to an Intervening Event, make a Change of
Recommendation, if the board of directors of the Company determines in good

 

 

 

-26-  

 

​

 

 

faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the board of directors of the Company to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that the board of directors of the Company shall not be entitled to
effect such a Change of Recommendation until (A) the Company sends written
notice to Parent (an "Intervening Event Notice") advising Parent that the
board of directors of the Company intends to effect such a Change of
Recommendation and specifying the reasons therefore, which notice shall
include a description the applicable Intervening Event, (B) during the three
Business Day period following the date on which the Intervening Event Notice
is received, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use
commercially reasonably efforts to negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the
extent Parent wishes to negotiate), to make adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (C) following the end of such three Business
Day period, the board of directors of the Company, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel and taking in account any revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent, shall have
determined in good faith that the failure of the board of directors of the
Company to make such a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
board of directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure of the board of
directors of the Company to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
the directors' exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall
the board of directors of the Company effect a Change of Recommendation except
in accordance with Section 5.3(c) or Section 5.3(d).

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
proposal or offer made by any Person or group of related Persons, and whether
involving a transaction or series of related transactions, for (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
the Company, (ii) the acquisition by any Person or group of related Persons of
more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (in each case, including securities of
the Subsidiaries of the Company), or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition
by any Person or group of related Persons of more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the outstanding Shares.

 

(g) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean a written
Alternative Proposal, substituting "fifty percent (50%)" for "twenty-five
percent (25%)," that the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's financial and legal advisors,
taking into account the timing, likelihood of consummation, legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the Alternative Proposal, including the
financing terms thereof, and such other factors as the Company's board of
directors considers to be appropriate, to be more favorable to the Company and
its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.4 SEC Filings; Other Actions.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement (and in any event no later than 20 Business Days after the date of
this Agreement), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement, which shall, subject to Section 5.3, include the Recommendation,
and shall use all reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement and to cause
the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as

this Agreement, or as otherwise required by law or requested by the SEC,
concerning themselves and their Affiliates. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the
other hand, relating to the

 

 

 

-27-  

 

​

 

 

Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and propose comments on the Proxy Statement (and any amendments or
supplements thereto) or any responses to the SEC and shall in good faith
consider such comments reasonably proposed by Parent for inclusion therein.
The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of Common
Stock as of the record date established for the Company Meeting as promptly as
practicable, and in no event more than five (5) Business Days after the date
on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement.

 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action required under the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation
and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders promptly following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company Meeting"),
with the record date and meeting date of the Company Meeting to be selected
after reasonable consultation with Parent, and (ii) subject to a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, use all reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated hereby. Within fifteen
Business Days after the date of this Agreement (and thereafter, upon the
reasonable request of Parent made not more than one time every two weeks), the
Company shall conduct a "broker search" in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the
Exchange Act for a record date for the Company Meeting that is twenty Business
Days after the date of such "broker search".

 

Section 5.5 Employee Matters.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Company to, honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of one
(1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to current employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
("Company Employees") who remain so employed (i) base compensation and bonus
opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to
the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) all other
compensation and employee benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that the Company may, in lieu of granting equity awards to
any particular Company Employee, grant to such employee cash or other awards.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit
accrual under any final average pay defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans that are health and welfare plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such
conditions would have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or
its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

​

 

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable, except to the extent doing so would result in
"additional tax" under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(d) The Company may establish a cash-based retention program in the aggregate
amount of $10 million to promote retention and to incentivize efforts to
consummate the Closing (the "Retention Program") with one-half (1/2) of any
such payments from such Retention Program to be paid upon the ninetieth (90th)
day following the Closing Date and one-half (1/2) of any such payments to be
paid upon the one hundred twentieth (120th) day following the Closing Date, in
each case, subject to continued employment with the Company and its
Subsidiaries through such date; provided, that if the individual's employment
with the Company is terminated due to a Qualifying Termination prior to any
scheduled payment date, then the unpaid portions of the payments shall be paid
upon the date of the individual's Qualifying Termination. Amounts under the
Retention Program shall be allocated among the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries identified, and in the amounts and other terms determined, by
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or his designees); provided that
the retention award allocated to any employee shall not exceed $650,000. If a
retention award or portion thereof under the Retention Program is forfeited by
a participant, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or his designees)
may reallocate the retention award (or unpaid portion thereof) to existing
employees or new hires of the Company and its Subsidiaries subject to the
$650,000 limitation specified above.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee any right
to continue in the employ or service of Parent or its Subsidiaries. No
provision of this Agreement or contained in this Section 5.5: (i) shall limit
the ability of the Company or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend,
modify or terminate in accordance with its terms any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (ii) shall be deemed or
construed to amend, establish, or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, or (iii) create any third
party beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any current
or former service provider or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof)) or any right to employment or
continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with
the Company or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

 

Section 5.6 Efforts.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
including the Specified Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the
taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity,
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties, (iii) the defending of any investigations or proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking
to avoid the entry of, or to have reversed, terminated, lifted or vacated, any
stay, temporary restraining order or other injunctive relief or order entered
by any Governmental Entity that could prevent or delay the transactions or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or Merger Sub be
required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party (other than with respect to Parent and Merger
Sub, any filing fees to any Governmental Entity) for any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any contract or agreement.

 

(b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly, but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, file any and all
required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR

 

 

 

-29-  

 

​

 

 

Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "HSR Filings"), and use best efforts to cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) promptly
file any and all required applications and notifications under the Competition
Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including a submission requesting from the Commissioner of
Competition an advance ruling certificate pursuant to subsection 102(1) of the
Competition Act, and use best efforts to cause the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting periods under the Competition Act, except that the
parties will only make a filing pursuant to Part IX of the Competition Act if
determined by Parent to be reasonably advisable after consultation with the
Company (the "Canadian Antitrust Filings" and together with the HSR Filings,
the "Antitrust Filings"), (iii) supply to any Governmental Entity as promptly
as practicable any additional information or documents that may be requested
pursuant to any Law or by such Governmental Entity, and (iv) take, or cause to
be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities, competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person may
assert under any Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later
than the End Date), including, without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y)
otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after the Closing Date
would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries' (including the
Surviving Corporation's or its Subsidiaries') freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries'
(including the Surviving Corporation's) businesses, product lines or assets,
in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
the Closing, materially delaying the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond
the End Date; provided that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order
of a Governmental Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or
to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or
business of the Company or any of its Affiliates, unless such requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Company only in
the event that the Closing occurs. Except as otherwise permitted under this
Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause their
Subsidiaries not to) take or agree to take any action with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 5.6 that would be reasonably likely to
prevent or materially delay the Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the Equity Investors shall have no obligation, and Parent
shall have no obligation to cause the Equity Investors, to sell, to hold
separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets or business of the Equity Investors or their
Affiliates, in each case other than the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions, and any other material actions
pursuant to this Section 5.6, and subject to applicable legal limitations and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.
Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection
with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written communications or
submissions, and with respect to any such notification, filing, written
communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith to any
Governmental Entity; provided, however, that materials may be redacted (w) to
exclude

 

 

 

-30-  

 

​

 

 

documents filed in response to Items 4(c) and 4(d) of the HSR Filing, (x) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with respect thereto,
(y) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements, and (z) as necessary
to address reasonable privilege concerns. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in Person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The foregoing
notwithstanding or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this
Section 5.6 shall limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) so long as such party has, prior to such
termination, complied with its obligations under this Section 5.6.

 

Section 5.7 Takeover Statute. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "interested person" "interested stockholder," "business
combination" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation, including
Section 203 of the DGCL (each, a "Takeover Statute") shall become applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

Section 5.8 Public Announcements. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation
except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as may be requested
by a Governmental Entity; provided that the restrictions in this Section 5.8
shall not apply to any Company communication regarding an Alternative Proposal
or a Change of Recommendation or any response of Parent thereto. Parent and
the Company agree to issue a separate press releases, each subject to the
prior approval of the other party, announcing this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any
indemnification or similar agreement disclosed on Section 5.9(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter or in the Company SEC Documents shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company's and
any Company Subsidiary's certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification or similar agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries disclosed on Section 5.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
in the Company SEC Documents with any of their respective directors, officers
or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall
not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the
Effective Time were current or former directors, officers

 

 

 

-31-  

 

​

 

 

or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or
asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
honor, and cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Section 5.9.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing subject to receipt of the undertaking
described below) each current and former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served at the Company's
request as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with such Person's heirs, executors
or administrators, an "Indemnified Party") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law provided, that the
Person to whom such costs and expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (an "Action"), arising out of, relating to or in connection with
any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred before or after
the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company). In the
event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in
effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. At the
Company's option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year (6) prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however that the Company shall not spend more than 350% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy and if the cost of such policy
would otherwise exceed such amount, the Company shall purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for a cost not exceeding such amount. If
the Company does not elect to purchase a prepaid "tail" policy, Parent may, at
its option, at or after the Effective Time, purchase a "tail" policy. If such
"tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time (or Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence), Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain such
policy in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party
shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

 

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9 (subject to
receipt of the undertaking described above).

 

 

 

-32-  

 

​

 

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties.

 

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9.

 

Section 5.10 Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 

Section 5.11 Financing.

 

(a) Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of
the Cash Equity and to cause the Rollover Equity to be transferred and
contributed on the terms and conditions described herein and in the Equity
Financing Commitment Letters prior to the End Date, including causing the
Equity Investors to maintain in effect the Equity Financing Commitment
Letters. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described herein and in the Debt Commitment Letters prior to the
End Date, including (i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii)
negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the
"Definitive Agreements") consistent with the terms and conditions contained
therein (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any
related fee letter) or, if available, on other terms that are acceptable to
Parent and would not adversely affect (including with respect to timing,
taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
and (iii) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period,
satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and its
Subsidiaries in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Agreements that are
within its control and complying with its obligations thereunder. In the event
that all conditions contained in any Commitment Letter (other than, with
respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Cash Equity) have been
satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied), Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Lenders thereunder to, and shall cause the Equity
Investors thereunder to, comply with their respective obligations, including
to fund the Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date.
Parent shall comply with its obligations, and enforce its rights, under the
Equity Financing Commitment Letters, in each case in a timely and diligent
manner. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with its
obligations, and reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights, under the Debt
Commitment Letters and Definitive Agreements, in each case in a timely and
diligent manner. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in
the event that (w) the Marketing Period has completed, (x) any portion of the
high yield bond financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter is
unavailable, (y) all closing conditions contained in Section 6.1 and 6.3 shall
be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, provided that such conditions are
capable of being satisfied as of such day assuming the Closing was to occur on
such day, and other than those conditions the failure of which to be satisfied
is a result of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) and (z) the
bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or alternative
bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 5.11(a)) are
available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
(or replacements thereof), then each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the
proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in accordance with this Agreement
in lieu of such portion of the high yield bond financing.

(i) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company: (A)
permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver
or remedy (w) adds new conditions (or modifies any existing conditions in a
manner adverse to Parent or the Company or the transactions contemplated
hereby) to the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing, (x)
reduces the amount of the Financing, (y) adversely affects the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters
or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against such other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date
hereof or in the Definitive Agreements or (z) taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period, could otherwise reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided that, for the avoidance
of doubt, Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, book-runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, if the
addition of such parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the availability of the
Financing or the consummation of the contemplated transactions); or (B)
terminate any Commitment Letter unless such Commitment Letter is replaced with
a new commitment that, were it structured as an amendment to an existing
Commitment Letter, would satisfy the requirements of the foregoing clause (A).
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement.

 

(ii) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (1) use reasonable best efforts
to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with Cash Equity and the available portion of the Debt Financing, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related
fees and expenses) from the same or other sources and which do not include any
conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are
more onerous to Parent than the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing and
are otherwise on terms no less favorable to Parent than such unavailable Debt
Financing (including the "flex" provisions of the related fee letter) and (2)
promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and, to Parent's Knowledge,
the reason therefor. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or
similar agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged in
compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the
time in question). Parent shall provide the Company with prompt oral and
written notice of (1) any material breach or default by any party to any
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements of which Parent gains
Knowledge or any termination of any of the Commitment Letters and (2) the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Lender,
Equity Investor, or other financing source with respect to any breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Agreements of any provision thereof; provided, however, that in
no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information
pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose
such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. In the event
that Parent does not provide access or information in reliance on the
preceding sentence, Parent shall provide notice to the Company that such
access or information is being withheld and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable
information in a way that would not violate the applicable obligation or risk
waiver of such privilege. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on
a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing. The
foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Parent with this Section 5.11 shall
not relieve Parent of its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available.

Subsidiaries to, provide and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause

requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries), including:

 

(i) preparing and furnishing Parent, Merger Sub and their Financing Sources as
promptly as reasonably practicable all Required Information and all other
financial and pertinent information and disclosures regarding the Company and

Financing or offering of Notes in connection with the Debt Financing;

 

(iii) assisting reasonably in the preparation of one or more credit or other
agreements, as well as any pledge and security documents, and other definitive

agreements, indentures and/or other instruments) in connection with such Debt
Financing or other certificates or documents as may reasonably be requested by
Parent and reasonably facilitating the taking of all corporate actions by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to entering such definitive
financing documents and otherwise necessary to permit consummation of the Debt
Financing;

 

(v) cooperating reasonably with the Lenders' due diligence, to the extent
customary and reasonable, in connection with the Debt Financing;

 

(vi) using reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) drafts of customary "comfort"
letters of independent accountants of the Company (which shall include
customary "negative assurance" comfort) prior to the beginning of the
Marketing Period, which such accountants would be prepared to issue at the
time of pricing and at closing of any offering or private placement of the
Debt Financing (in the form of debt securities) pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act upon completion of customary procedures, (ii) surveys and
title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent as necessary and customary
for financings similar to the Debt Financing, and (iii) legal opinions of in-
house or "local" counsel customary for financings similar to the Debt
Financing;

 

(vii) reasonably assisting Parent in procuring a public corporate credit
rating and a public corporate family rating in respect of the relevant
borrower or issuer under the Debt Financing and public ratings for the Debt
Financing or notes to be offered in connection with the Debt Financing;

 

(viii) (A) permitting the prospective lenders involved in the Debt Financing
to evaluate the Company's inventory, current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose
of establishing collateral arrangements (including conducting field exams, the
commercial finance examinations and inventory, equipment and real property
appraisals) and (B) assisting Parent with the establishment of bank and other
accounts and blocked account and control agreements of the Company and one or
more of its Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing, in each case to the

in substantially the form set forth on Annex I to Exhibit E of the Debt
Commitment Letter with respect to solvency matters, (B) obtaining customary
authorization letters with respect to the bank information memoranda from a

any borrowing base certificates requested by Parent a reasonable time prior to
Closing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and (D) using reasonable best

materials relating to the Debt Financing; and

 

(x) at least four (4) Business Days prior to Closing, providing all
documentation and other information about the Company that is reasonably
requested by the Lenders and the Lenders reasonably determine is required by
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent
requested by Parent in writing at least nine (9) Business Days prior to
Closing.

 

it being understood that the Company shall have satisfied its obligations set
forth in clauses (i) through (x) of this sentence if the Company shall have
used its reasonable best efforts to comply with such obligations whether or
not any applicable deliverables are actually obtained or provided. The
foregoing notwithstanding, (A) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries, nor
any Persons who are directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution
of the Debt Financing or execute or deliver any certificate, document,
instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Effective Time or agree
to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document,
instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Effective Time (except
the authorization letter contemplated by clause (viii)(B) above), (B) no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives undertaken pursuant to the foregoing shall be
effective until the Effective Time (except with respect to the authorization
letter contemplated by clause (viii)(B) above) and (C) none of the Company or
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives shall be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense
that is not promptly reimbursed by Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing. Nothing contained in this Section
5.11(b) or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with such
cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to
this Section 5.11(b) and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries).

 

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to
Section 5.11 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreements; provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose
Confidential Information to potential debt financing sources for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and their Representatives without
the prior written consent of the Company if such potential debt financing
sources and their Representatives who receive such information are subject to
a confidentiality agreement no less restrictive than the Confidentiality
Agreements with respect to such information or as provided in the Debt
Commitment Letter. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing.

 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent, on
or prior to the third Business Day prior to the Effective Time, a copy of a
payoff letter (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent), in
customary form, from the Agent (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility)
under the senior secured revolving credit agreement identified in Section 3.3
of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to deliver all notices and to take all other actions to facilitate the
termination of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, the repayment
in full of all Obligations (as defined in such Revolving Credit Facility) then
outstanding thereunder (using funds arranged by Parent) and the release of any
liens and termination of all guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing
Date (such termination, repayment and release, the "Revolving Credit Facility
Termination"); provided that in no event shall this Section

 

 

 

-36-  

 

​

 

 

5.11(d) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cause such Revolving
Credit Facility Termination unless the Closing shall occur substantially
concurrently and the Company or its Subsidiaries have received funds from
Parent to pay in full all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties,
breakage costs, fees or similar obligations related to any Obligations (as
defined in such Revolving Credit Facility) under such Revolving Credit
Facility as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual
thereafter).

 

(e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent, on
or prior to the third Business Day prior to the Effective Time, a copy of a
payoff letter (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent and/or the
maintenance of existing cash collateral), in customary form, from the L/C
Issuer (as defined in the Letter of Credit Agreement) under the letter of
credit agreement identified in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the "Letter of Credit Facility"). The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices and to
take all other actions to facilitate the termination of commitments under the
Letter of Credit Facility, the repayment in full of all Obligations (as
defined in such Letter of Credit Facility) then outstanding thereunder (using
funds arranged by Parent or, at the request of Parent, the maintenance of
existing cash collateral) and the release of any liens and termination of all
guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing Date (such termination,
repayment and release, the "Letter of Credit Facility Termination"); provided
that in no event shall this Section 5.11(e) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to cause such Letter of Credit Facility Termination unless the
Closing shall occur substantially concurrently and the Company or its
Subsidiaries have received funds from Parent to pay in full all principal,
interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs, fees or similar
obligations related to any Obligations (as defined in such Letter of Credit
Facility) under such Letter of Credit Facility as of the anticipated Closing
Date (and the daily accrual thereafter). The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to take all actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the
release of cash collateral securing the letters of credit issued under the
Letter of Credit Facility prior to the Effective Time, which actions may
include using its reasonable best efforts to (i) facilitate the replacement of
such letters of credit on the Closing Date with new letters of credit issued
pursuant to the Debt Financing, (ii) facilitate having such letters of credit
"rolled over" on the Closing Date and be deemed issued pursuant to the Debt
Financing, and/or (iii) renew (or replace at maturity) any such letters of
credit on commercially reasonable terms that facilitate the foregoing.

 

(f) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, upon request of
Parent, periodically update any Required Information (to the extent it is
available) to be included in any Offering Document to be used in connection
with the Debt Financing or offering of notes in connection with the Debt
Financing so that Parent and Merger Sub may ensure that such Required
Information, when taken as a whole, does not contain as of the time provided,
giving effect to any supplements, any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein not materially misleading.

 

Section 5.12 Other Investors. Prior to the Effective Time, except pursuant to
the Rollover Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Parent shall not permit or agree to permit any Person who holds Shares of the
Company to rollover (or reinvest the Merger Consideration with respect to (or
other proceeds from the sale of) such Shares) for any equity interests (or
rights to obtain any equity interests) in Parent or any Person of which Merger
Sub is a direct or indirect Subsidiary.

 

Section 5.13 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.14 Stock Exchange De-listing. Each of the Company and Parent shall
take such actions reasonably required to cause the Shares to be de-listed from
the Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.15 Notice of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation. Each party
hereto shall give prompt written notice to the other party hereto, of any
notice or other communication received by such party (or its Subsidiaries)
from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any person alleging that
the consent of such person

 

 

 

-37-  

 

​

 

 

is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto shall give reasonably prompt written notice to
the other party hereto, if to such party's Knowledge, (i) any representation
or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or
inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to expect that the applicable
closing conditions would be incapable of being satisfied by the End Date or
(ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; provided that, (a) nothing in this sentence shall be deemed to
affect, modify or condition the obligations of each party to effect the
Closing and the Parent's obligation to pay the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms hereof and (b) each party's obligations, actions or
inactions pursuant to this sentence shall be deemed excluded for purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in either Section 6.2(b) or
Section 6.3(b) have been satisfied; provided further that the immediately
preceding proviso shall not apply if a party shall have concluded that (in the
case of either clause (i) or (ii)) that the relevant closing conditions in
Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) or Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b), as applicable, would be
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date and it intentionally does not
provide such notice. In the event that any litigation or other Action of any
stockholder related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is initiated or pending, or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened, against any of the Company or its Subsidiaries
and/or the members of the Board of Directors of the Company (or of any
equivalent governing body of any Subsidiary of the Company) prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
stockholder Action and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to
the status thereof and give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any such litigation or other Action. None of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall compromise, settle, come
to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any such stockholder Action or consent to the same
unless Parent shall have first consented in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 5.16 Resignation of Directors. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the resignation of all of the members of the board of
directors of the Company who are in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time (and to the extent requested by Parent, from any member of the board of
directors (or any equivalent) of each Subsidiary of the Company), which
resignations shall be effective at, and conditioned upon the occurrence of,
the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.17 Cash Transfers. Upon request by Parent made at least five
Business Days prior to the Closing and in any event after the satisfaction of
all the conditions to Closing (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing), to the
extent permitted by Law and subject to the reasonable operational requirements
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (provided that Parent will indemnify the
Company with respect to any fees, losses, expenses or Taxes incurred as a
result), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) sell for cash, with effect as of a date
reasonably proximate to the Closing Date, marketable securities and cash
equivalents held by, or on behalf of or for the benefit of, the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries and (y) transfer from Subsidiaries (including those
located in Canada), prior to the Effective Time, an amount of cash to the
Company, in as Tax- and cost-efficient method as is reasonably practicable
(after consultation with Parent) taking into account the working capital
requirements of the Company's Subsidiaries, with a view towards making
available at the Effective Time such cash amounts. Any available cash of the
Company on hand at the Closing may be used for payments to be made at the
Closing as directed by Parent; provided that, notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, (a) nothing in this Section 5.17 shall be deemed to affect,
modify or condition the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the
Closing and pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof
and (b) the Company's obligations, actions or inactions pursuant to this
Section 5.17 shall be deemed excluded for purposes of determining whether the
condition set forth in Section 6.3(b) has been satisfied.

and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates;

obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee,
if, as and when required pursuant to Section 7.3; (ii) subject to the

Section 7.3 Termination Fees.

 

(a) Company Termination Fee. Any provision in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, if (x) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(g), (y) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(A) or (z) (A) after the date of this Agreement, an
Alternative Proposal (substituting fifty percent (50%) for the twenty-five
percent (25%) threshold set forth in the definition of "Alternative Proposal")
(a "Qualifying Transaction") is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior
to the Company Meeting, and not withdrawn at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Company Meeting with respect to a termination pursuant to Section
7.1(d), is proposed to the Company or publicly disclosed prior to the End Date
with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or is proposed to the
Company or publicly disclosed prior to the event giving rise to the
termination right with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(B);
(B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(b) (if and only if the Company Meeting has not been held and concluded
prior to such termination) or pursuant to Section 7.1(d), or this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(B), and (C) concurrently with
or within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement providing for a Qualifying Transaction or
completed a Qualifying Transaction, then in any such event the Company shall
pay to Parent (or its designee(s)) a fee of $255,000,000 million in cash (the
"Company Termination Fee") less any amounts previously paid to Parent (or its
designee(s)) pursuant to the last sentence of Section 7.3(a) below, and the
Company shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions

​

 

 

contemplated hereby to Parent or its stockholders or Affiliates, such payment
to be made, with respect to clauses (x) and (y) above, within three (3)
Business Days of such termination and, with respect to clause (z) above, prior
to or concurrent with the earlier of entry into such definitive agreement
providing for a Qualifying Transaction or completing such Qualifying
Transaction; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In the
event this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) or (y) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(B) due, in the case
of this clause (y), to Willful and Material Breach of any representation or
covenant of this Agreement by the Company, then the Company shall pay to
Parent (or its designee(s)) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment banks, advisors and
consultants to Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Investors or their respective
Affiliates, and all out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Financing sources for
which Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Investors or their Affiliates may be
responsible) incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Investors or their
respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount shall not be greater than $15,000,000 by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

 

(b) Parent Termination Fee. If this Agreement (x) is terminated by the Company
pursuant to (A) Section 7.1(e) or (B) Section 7.1(h) or (y) is terminated by
either party pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and at such time the Company could
have terminated under Section 7.1(e) or Section 7.1(h) (each of (x) and (y), a
"Specified Termination"), then in each case of (x) and (y), Parent shall pay,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the Company, within three (3) Business Days after the date on which this
Agreement is so terminated, to the Company the fee of $510,000,000 in cash
(the "Parent Termination Fee"). Parent acknowledges that the agreement
contained in this Section 7.3(b) is an integral part of this Agreement and
that, without this Section 7.3(b), the Company would not have entered into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 7.3(b), Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the
Company all fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including attorney's fees
as well as expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated by the
Company), together with interest on the amount of the Parent Termination Fee
at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, in effect
on the date such payment is required to be made.

 

(c) Other.

 

(i) The parties acknowledge that each of the Parent Termination Fee and the
Company Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such
amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the right of the Company to
receive the Parent Termination Fee shall not limit or otherwise affect the
Company's right to specific performance as provided in Section 8.5; provided
that the Company shall not be entitled under any circumstances to both (i)
receive the Parent Termination Fee and (ii) specific performance of Parent's
obligation to cause the Cash Equity to be funded, the Rollover Equity to be
contributed or to effect the Closing in accordance with Article II. In no
event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if Parent
fails to effect the Closing when required by Section 1.2 for any or no reason
or otherwise breaches this Agreement (whether such breach is intentional,
unintentional, a Willful and Material Breach or otherwise) or fails to perform
hereunder (whether such failure is intentional, unintentional, a Willful and
Material Breach or otherwise), the Company's right to terminate this Agreement
and, if applicable, right to (1) to seek monetary damages (if the Parent
Termination Fee is not payable and subject to a cap in the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement)
or (2) receive the Parent Termination Fee and/or the Parent Reimbursable
Expenses shall, other than as expressly provided by Section 8.5, be the sole
and exclusive remedies (and in all events shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedies) of the Company and its Affiliates (and any other Person)
against the Parent Related Parties, the Lenders and the Lender Related Parties
for any losses, damages or liabilities arising out of or related to this
Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,

agreement or obligation contained herein), the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the failure of the Closing to be consummated, the Termination
Fee Commitment Letters, the Commitment Letters and the financings contemplated
therein, including the Debt Financing and the financing of the Cash Equity
(and the abandonment or termination thereof) and, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent have any monetary
liability in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee and none of
the Parent Related Parties shall have any liability or obligation (provided
that either the Parent Termination Fee (if due) or the Parent Reimbursable
Expenses (if any) have been paid or, to the extent entitled by the terms
hereof, the Company has recovered damages in the amount up to the Parent
Termination Fee), including any multiple, consequential, indirect, special,
exemplary or punitive damages, relating to or arising out of this Agreement
(or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation contained in this Agreement), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the failure of the Closing to be consummated, the Termination Fee
Commitment Letters or the Commitment Letters and the financings contemplated
therein, including the Debt Financing and the financing of the Cash Equity
(and the abandonment or termination thereof), or in respect of any other
agreement, document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise
(except that the applicable Parent Related Parties shall remain subject to the
provisions surviving such termination pursuant to Section 7.2 and the
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreements and the Company may be
entitled to specifically enforce the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreements or the provisions surviving such termination pursuant to Section
7.2). In no event shall the Company (or any other Person) seek or be entitled
to multiple, consequential, indirect, special, exemplary or punitive damages
against the Parent Related Parties, the Lenders and the Lender Parties, or any
recovery, judgment or damages of any kind against the Parent Related Parties,
the Lenders and the Lender Parties (in each case other than against an Equity
Investor (or its permitted assignees) under and subject to the terms and
conditions of its respective Termination Fee Commitment Letter or against
Parent or Merger Sub under and subject to the terms of this Agreement.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of the Company for a breach of this Agreement (whether
such breach is intentional, unintentional, a Willful and Material Breach or
otherwise) (including any multiple, consequential, indirect, special,
exemplary or punitive damages) shall not exceed $510,000,000.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than
with respect to the Company's right to receive and/or bring a claim for Parent
Reimbursable Expenses, in the event that the Company is paid the Parent
Termination Fee, the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee by the Company
shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Person arising out of,
related to or otherwise in connection with this Agreement (or any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained
herein), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the failure of the
Closing to be consummated, the Termination Fee Commitment Letters or the
Commitment Letters and the financings contemplated therein, including the Debt
Financing and the financing of the Cash Equity (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any other matter forming the basis for such
termination, and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Parent Related Party arising out of, related to or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the failure of the Closing to be consummated,
Termination Fee Commitment Letters or the Commitment Letters and the
financings contemplated therein, including the Debt Financing and the
financing of the Cash Equity (and the abandonment or termination thereof).

 

(v) Other than with respect to the Retained Claims (as defined below), all
Actions or claims (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out of
or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to (A) this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements, the Equity Financing Commitment
Letters, and the Termination Fee Commitment Letters, (B) the negotiation,
execution or performance of any such agreement referred to in clause (A)
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection

with, or as an inducement to, any such agreement referred to in clause (A)),
(C) any breach of this Agreement and (D) any failure of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, may be
made only against (and are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly
identified as parties to this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements, the
Equity Financing Commitment Letters and the Termination Fee Commitment
Letters. No other Parent Related Party shall have any liabilities (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any
Actions or claims arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any
manner to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (A) through (D)
except for Actions or claims that the Company may assert: (x) against any
party under, and solely pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreements or the Voting Agreement; (y) against any party (or any of its
permitted assignees) under, and solely pursuant to the terms of, the Equity
Financing Commitment Letters or the Termination Fee Commitment Letters; and

terms of, this Agreement (the Actions or claims in clauses (x) through (z) of
this sentence, the "Retained Claims").

contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of this Agreement and that,
without this Section 7.3, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement.

telecopy or otherwise) to the other parties.

 

Section 8.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without

the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the

In addition, subject to Section 8 of each of the Termination Fee Commitment
Letters, each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be

-44-  

 

​

 

 

not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 8.4,
(b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 8.7 shall be

any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Lenders or any Lender Related Party in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Financing or any of the transactions

thereof, in any forum other than any State or Federal court sitting in the

Section 8.5 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each party agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it, whether in law or equity) to obtain (i) a
decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or the Financing and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or the Financing shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties

Parent and Merger Sub (A) of Parent's obligations under Section 5.11,
including, to the extent contemplated by Section 5.11, Parent's obligation to

with the terms of the Commitment Letters and to enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letters as contemplated by Section 5.11, (B) of Parent's obligation
to cause the Rollover Investor to transfer and contribute the Rollover Equity,
(C) of Parent's obligations to cause the Equity Investors to maintain in
effect the Equity Financing Commitment Letters pursuant to Section 5.11, (D)
of Parent's obligations to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to the
terms and conditions of Section 7.3(b) and Parent's obligations to pay Parent
Reimbursable Expenses pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and its other
obligations in respect of the expenses pursuant to Section 5.11, (E) to

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is explicitly
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
Parent's obligation to cause the Cash Equity to be funded and the Rollover
Equity to be transferred and contributed or to effect the Closing in
accordance with Article II, if and only if (A) all conditions in Section 6.1
and Section 6.3 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing)) at the time when the Closing
is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.2, (B) the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt

Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the
approval of the stockholders of the Company. The foregoing notwithstanding, no
failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
