WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement;

  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I 
  
 THE OFFER

  

SECTION 1.01. _The Offer_. (a) (i) Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 and that none of
the events set forth in paragraph (2) of Exhibit A hereto shall have
occurred or be existing, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than eight Business
Days after the date hereof commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "))
the Offer to purchase all outstanding Shares, at the Offer Price. The
obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for
payment and to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to only those conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the " _Offer
Conditions_ "). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the
twentieth Business Day (as defined in Section 9.10(c)) following (and
including the day of) the commencement of the Offer. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right (but is not obligated) at any time or from time to time in
its sole discretion to waive any Offer Condition or modify or amend the terms
of the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of the
consideration payable in the Offer, (B) decrease the number of Shares sought
pursuant to the Offer, (C) amend or waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as
defined in Exhibit A), (D) add to the conditions set forth on Exhibit A or
modify the conditions set forth on Exhibit A in a manner adverse to the
holders of Shares, (E) extend the expiration of the Offer except as required
or permitted by 1.01(a)(ii) or (F) make any other change in the terms or
conditions of the Offer which is adverse to the holders of Shares.

  

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions as of any scheduled expiration
of the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, accept
for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as soon as practicable after such scheduled expiration. Purchaser
may, without the consent of the Company, (A) extend the Offer for one or more
periods of time of up to ten Business Days per extension if at any scheduled
expiration of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions are not satisfied, until
such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived, (B) extend the
Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the
staff thereof or the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") applicable to the Offer
or (C) elect to provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. So long as the Offer and
this Agreement have not been terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, (1) if, as
of any Expiration Date (as defined in Exhibit A), the Offer Conditions set
forth in Paragraph 1(b), (c) and (d) of Exhibit A (such Offer Conditions, the
" _Regulatory Conditions_ ") are not satisfied or waived by Purchaser, then
upon written request by the

     

   

Company delivered on or prior to such Expiration Date, Purchaser shall extend
the Offer for a period of not more than ten Business Days, in order to permit
the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; (2) if, as of any Expiration Date,
all of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) have
been satisfied or waived by Purchaser, but the Minimum Tender Condition is
not satisfied, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for a period of five Business
Days, in order to permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; _provided_
, that if at the end of such five Business Day period, all of the Offer
Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are satisfied, but the
Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied, Purchaser shall not be required to
make any further extension pursuant to this clause (2); (3) if, as of any
Expiration Date, the Offer Condition set forth in Paragraph 2(c) of Exhibit A
(the " _Absence of Breach Condition_ ") is not satisfied and has not been
waived, then upon written request by the Company delivered on or prior to
such Expiration Date, to the extent that the Company is entitled pursuant to
Section 8.01(d)(i)(B) to attempt to cure such breach of its representations
and warranties, or failure to comply with any of its covenants, contained in
this Agreement, and the cure of such breach or failure would result in the
satisfaction of the Absence of Breach Condition, Purchaser shall extend the
Offer until the date of the expiration of such cure period, or such earlier
date as specified by the Company in its request; and (4) if, within four
Business Days prior to any Expiration Date occurring on or before January 4,
2007, the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal (or a revision to a
previously received Acquisition Proposal) that is still pending as of such
Expiration Date, then upon written request of the Company, Purchaser shall
extend the Offer if necessary so that the Expiration Date does not occur
until the later of (x) the date that is five Business Days following the date
of the Companys initial receipt of such Acquisition Proposal (or such
revision to a previously received Acquisition Proposal) and (y) the last
Business Day of any required notice period pursuant to Section 6.02(e) or
8.01(e), or such earlier date as specified by the Company in its request.
Subject to the proviso in clause (2) above, the foregoing rights of the
Company to cause an extension of the Offer are cumulative so that if at any
time, any of the foregoing is applicable, the Offer shall be so extended
further. In addition, in the event that fewer than 90% of the total number of
outstanding Shares have been validly tendered and not withdrawn, Purchaser
shall, if requested by the Company on the Expiration Date, make available a
subsequent offering period in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act
for a period of time determined by Parent, but not less than five Business
Days. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that shares of
restricted stock may be tendered in the Offer and be acquired by Parent or
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price may be increased and
the Offer may be extended to the extent required by law in connection with
such increase in each case without the consent of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing Purchaser shall not be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Outside Date.

  

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file
or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
with respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to purchase and
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ "). The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on

     

   

the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser
agree (i) to provide the Company with, and to consult with the Company
regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and prior
to responding thereto and (ii) to provide the Company with any comments
or responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and the Company each agrees promptly
to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if
and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the
extent required by applicable law.

  

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  

SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions_. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that (i) the making of any
offer and proposal and the taking of any other action by Parent or Purchaser
in accordance with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
have been consented to by the Company Board in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 9,
2005 between an Affiliate (as defined in Section 9.10(a)) of Parent and the
Company, as amended on November 6, 2006 to, among other things, add Parent as
a party (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), (ii) the Company Board (at a
meeting or meetings duly called and held) has unanimously (A) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the
stockholders of the Company, (B) approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (C) approved and declared advisable the agreement of
merger (as such term is used in Section 251 of the Corporation Law) contained
in this Agreement and directed that such agreement of merger be submitted to
the stockholders of the Company for adoption (unless the Merger
is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the Corporation Law as
contemplated by Section 2.09) and resolved to recommend acceptance of the
Offer and adoption of the agreement of merger (as such term is used in
Section 251 of the Corporation Law) contained in this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, (D) irrevocably taken all necessary steps to
render Section 203 of the Corporation Law and the Rights inapplicable to
Parent and Purchaser and to the Merger, this Agreement and the acquisition of
Shares pursuant to the Offer (other than actions to be taken by the Rights
Agent (which actions the Company shall cause the Rights Agent to irrevocably
take as soon as practicable (but no later than three Business Days) following
the date hereof)) and (E) irrevocably resolved to elect, to the extent
permitted by law, not to be subject to any other "moratorium", "control share
acquisition", "business combination", "fair price" or other form of anti-
takeover laws and regulations (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") of any
jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to this Agreement and (iii)
KeyBanc Capital Markets (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ "), the Companys
financial advisor, has delivered its opinion to the Company Board to the
effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters
set forth therein, the consideration to be paid in the Offer and the Merger
to the Companys stockholders is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such stockholders. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, an

     

   

executed copy of the written opinion of the Company Financial Advisor will be
delivered to Parent.

  

(b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed, the Company shall file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ")
containing, subject to Section 6.02(e), the recommendations of the Company
Board described in Section 1.02(a) and subject to Section 6.02(e), the
Company, hereby consents to the inclusion of such recommendations in the
Offer Documents and to the inclusion of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the
Offer Documents mailed or furnished to the Companys stockholders. Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its filing with the SEC. The
Company agrees (i) to provide Parent and Purchaser with, and to consult with
Parent and Purchaser regarding, any comments that may be received from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly upon receipt
thereof and prior to responding thereto and (ii) to provide Parent and
Purchaser with any comments or responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and
the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as
and to the extent required by applicable law.

  

SECTION 1.03. _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly (but in any event within
five Business Days after the date hereof), furnish Parent and Purchaser with
mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or
computer file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the
Shares as of the latest practicable date and shall furnish Parent and
Purchaser with such information and assistance (including periodic updates of
such information) as Parent or Purchaser or their agents may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
the Shares.

  

SECTION 1.04. _Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the purchase by
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer of such number of Shares as represents at
least a majority of the outstanding Shares, and from time to time thereafter,
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up
to the next whole number, on the Company Board as will give Purchaser
representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number
of directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to any increase in the
number of directors pursuant to this Section 1.04) and the percentage that
such number of Shares so purchased bears to the total number of Shares
outstanding, and the Company shall, upon request by Purchaser, promptly
increase the size of the Company Board or use its reasonable best efforts to
secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to
provide Purchaser with such level of representation and shall cause
Purchasers designees to be so elected or appointed. The Company will also
use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals designated by Purchaser
to constitute the same percentage as is on the entire Company Board to
constitute (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of
directors and each committee thereof of each wholly owned Subsidiary (as
defined in Section 9.10(f)) of the Company and (iii) the designees,
appointees or other similar representatives of the Company on each Board of
Directors and each committee thereof of each non-wholly owned Subsidiary. The
Companys

     

   

obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. At the request of Purchaser, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to effect any such election or appointment
of Purchasers designees, including mailing to its stockholders the
information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l
promulgated thereunder which, unless Purchaser otherwise elects, shall be so
mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Purchaser will supply to
the Company all information with respect to themselves and their
respective officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section and
Rule.

  

(b) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant
to Section 1.04(a) and prior to the Effective Time, and so long as there
shall be at least one Continuing Director, any amendment or termination of
this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, any extension of time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Purchaser under this Agreement and any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions under this Agreement for the benefit of the Company
or any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement will
require the concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company then in
office who are directors of the Company on the date hereof (the " _Continuing
Directors_ ").

  

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to Section 1.04(a), until the Effective Time, (i) the
Company Board shall have at least such number of directors as may be required
by the rules of the NYSE or the federal securities laws who are considered
independent directors within the meaning of such rules and laws ("
_Independent Directors_ ") and (ii) each committee of the Company Board that
is required by such rules or securities laws to be comprised solely of, or a
majority of, Independent Directors shall be so comprised; provided, however,
that in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced
below the number of directors as may be required by such rules or securities
laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall
be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed
to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other
Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such
number of directors as may be required by the rules of the NYSE and the
federal securities laws, to fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders
or Affiliates of Parent or Purchaser, and such Persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 1.05. _Top-Up Option_. (a)  The Company hereby irrevocably grants to
Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the
acceptance by Purchaser of, and payment for, Shares tendered in the Offer, to
purchase that number (but not less than that number) of Shares (the " _Top-Up
Shares_ ") as is equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the
number of Shares owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Purchaser at the
time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the total
Shares then outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares) at a
price per Share equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, at such time as Parent and
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, own at least 85% of the total number of
Shares then outstanding and on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the
expiration of the Offer or the expiration date of any subsequent offering
period; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be
exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the Companys then

     

   

authorized and unissued shares of common stock (including, for purposes of
this Section 1.05, as authorized and unissued shares of common stock any
Shares held in the treasury of the Company). The obligation of the
Company to deliver the Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option
is subject to the condition that no provision of any applicable law (which
for the avoidance of doubt, does not include the rules or regulations of the
NYSE which shall not apply) and no judgment, injunction, order or decree
shall prohibit, or require any action or consent of the Companys
stockholders in connection with, the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise.

  

(b) Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any legends
required by applicable securities laws.

  

(c) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Shares that Purchaser may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be
issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not
involving a public offering.  Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to
the Company that Purchaser is, or will be upon exercise of the Top-Up Option,
an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the
Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise thereof are being and will
be acquired for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for
resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act.

  

ARTICLE II 
  
 THE MERGER

  

SECTION 2.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Corporation Law, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company as soon
as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the
conditions set forth in Article VII. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") under the name
"Evraz North America, Inc." and shall continue its existence under the laws
of the State of Delaware. In connection with the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease. Upon the election of Parent, the
Merger may be structured so that the Company shall be merged with and into
Purchaser, with Purchaser continuing as the Surviving Corporation; _provided_
, that the Company shall not be deemed to have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement by reason of such election.

  

SECTION 2.02. _Consummation of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, Purchaser and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a duly
executed certificate of merger, as required by the Corporation Law, and shall
take all such further actions as may be required by law to make the Merger
effective. Prior to the filing referred to in this Section 2.02, a closing
(the " _Closing_ ") will be held at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and
Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York (or such other place as
the parties may agree) for the purpose of

     

   

confirming all the matters contained herein. The time the Merger becomes
effective in accordance with applicable law is referred to as the "
_Effective Time_."

  

SECTION 2.03. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the Corporation Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

SECTION 2.04. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as the Certificate of Incorporation of
Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
Article I thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the Corporation
is Evraz North America, Inc." and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by law. The Bylaws of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

SECTION 2.05. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Purchaser immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified or until their earlier death, permanent disability, resignation
or removal; _provided_ that, one of the directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be appointed by the United Steelworkers of America ("
_USWA_ "), to the extent and only for so long as required pursuant to the
Collective Bargaining Agreement dated September 10, 2004, between Rocky
Mountain Steel Mills and USWA, on behalf of Local Union 2102.

  

SECTION 2.06. _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent,
Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company or held in the treasury
of the Company, all of which shall be canceled without any consideration
being exchanged therefor and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 3.01)) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into the right
to receive in cash an amount per Share (subject to any applicable withholding
tax specified in Section 2.10) equal to the Offer Price, without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the certificate
representing such Shares as provided in Section 3.02. At the Effective Time
all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided herein.

  

SECTION 2.07. _Conversion of Common Stock of Purchaser_. Each share of common
stock, $0.01 par value, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     

   

SECTION 2.08. _Written Consent_. Unless the Merger is consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the Corporation Law as contemplated by Section
2.09, promptly following the consummation of the Offer (including any
subsequent offering period), Parent and Purchaser shall (i) consent in
writing, in accordance with Section 228 of the Corporation Law (the "
_Stockholder Approval_ "), to the adoption of the agreement of merger (within
the meaning of Section 251 of the Corporation Law) set forth in this
Agreement, without a meeting, and (ii) deliver such consent to the Secretary
of the Company.

  

SECTION 2.09. _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. If, following the
Offer and any subsequent offering period or the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, Parent, Purchaser, or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent, shall hold at least 90 percent of the outstanding shares of each
class of capital stock of the Company, each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger
to become effective, as soon as practicable after the consummation of the
Offer, without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with
Section 253 of the Corporation Law.

  

SECTION 2.10. _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares, Existing Stock
Options, Restricted Shares or Equity Awards pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are required to be
withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement and the Offer as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares, Existing Stock Options, Restricted Shares or Equity
Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

ARTICLE III 
  
 DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS

  

SECTION 3.01. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by stockholders properly exercising appraisal
rights available under Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal under the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in
accordance with Section 262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right
to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into and
become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal shall have been
irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Purchaser (a) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
Corporation Law and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the
"fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the
Corporation Law, and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Corporation Law.
The Company

     

   

shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of
the Company, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands.

  

SECTION 3.02. _Payment for Shares_. (a) From time to time after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause Purchaser to make available to a bank or
trust company located in the United States designated by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") sufficient
funds to make the payments due pursuant to Section 2.06 on a timely basis to
holders of Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such funds being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make
the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund.
Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Shares and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii)
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose,
except as provided in this Agreement.

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder, as of
the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates (the "
_Certificates_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares (other than Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and Dissenting Shares), a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificate and receiving payment therefor.
Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such
letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable
withholding tax as specified in Section 2.10) equal to the product of the
number of Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by the Merger
Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.  No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person (as defined in Section
9.10(e)) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable.  From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.02, each Certificate shall
represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with
the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number
of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.

     

   

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making on an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby.

  

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be repaid to the
Surviving Corporation.  Any former stockholders of the Company who have not
complied with Section 3.01 prior to the end of such six-month period shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) but only as general creditors
thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund
or otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.  If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
as shall be immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would
otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law)
unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

SECTION 3.03. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. No transfer of
Shares shall be made in the stock transfer books of the Company after the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III, subject to
applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

  

SECTION 3.04. _Existing Stock Options_. Each option or right to acquire Shares
(the " _Options_ ") granted under any stock option or similar plan of the
Company or under any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (the " _Stock Option Plans_ ") which is outstanding
(regardless of whether it is vested or exercisable) at the later of (a) the
completion of the Offer and (b) the earlier of January 2, 2007 and the
Effective Time (such date, the " _Option Cash-Out Date_ " and any such
Options, the " _Existing Stock Options_ ") shall by virtue of the completion
of the Offer and without any action on the part of the Company or the holder
thereof, be converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, with respect to each Share subject thereto equal to
the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price of such
Existing Stock Option.  At the Option Cash-Out Date, each holder of an
Existing Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, as soon as practicable
and in any event not later than five Business Days after the Option Cash-Out
Date, in full satisfaction of such Existing Stock Option, an amount in cash
without interest in respect thereof equal to the product of (a) the excess,
if any, of the Offer Price over the per share exercise price of such Existing
Stock Option and (b) the number of Shares subject to such Existing Stock
Option, and each Existing Stock Option shall be canceled as of the Option
Cash-Out Date. Such payment shall be reduced by any income or employment tax
withholding required under the Code or any provision of state, local

     

   

or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of such Existing Stock Option. Prior to the Option Cash-Out
Date, if necessary, the Company Board shall exercise its authority under each
Stock Option Plan to determine that each Existing Stock Option shall be
converted, at the Option Cash-Out Date, in the manner described in this
Section 3.04. The Stock Option Plans shall terminate as of the Option Cash-
Out Date and any and all rights under any provisions in any other plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as of the Option Cash-Out Date. All
administrative and other rights and authorities granted under any Stock
Option Plan to the Company, the Company Board or any Committee or designee
thereof, shall, following the Effective Time, reside with the Surviving
Corporation.

  

SECTION 3.05. _Other Equity Based Awards_. Set forth in Schedule 3.05(a) of
the Disclosure Letter is each incentive award or other right relating to, or
the value of which is based on the value of, Shares, other than an Option (an
" _Equity Award_ ") that was granted under any employee incentive or similar
plan of the Company, including the Companys 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the " _LTIP_ ") or under any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (an " _Equity Plan_ ") and that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares in the Offer and
that shall by virtue of the completion of the Offer and in accordance with
the terms of the Equity Plan pursuant to which such Equity Award was made,
and without any action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be
converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, determined by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the
number of Shares represented by such Equity Award. Each holder of an Equity
Award shall be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of such Equity
Award, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying (i) the
Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of Shares represented by such Equity
Award and each Equity Award shall be canceled as of the acceptance for
payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer. With respect to each Equity Award
that is a Restricted Share, the payment shall be made not later than five
Business Days after the completion of the Offer and shall be made without
regard to whether any restrictions remain in effect with respect to such
Equity Award and the holder of such Restricted Share shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect thereto. With respect to each Equity Award
under the LTIP that is not a Restricted Share, the payment shall be made on a
pro rata basis through the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
LTIP and paid no later than five Business Days after the Effective Time and
any portion of such an award that is not payable under this Section 3.05
shall be forfeited, and such participant shall cease to have any entitlement
therefor. Such payment with respect to Equity Awards shall be reduced by any
income or employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Equity Award. Prior
to the completion of the Offer, if necessary, the Company Board shall
exercise its authority under each Equity Plan to determine that each Equity
Award shall be converted, at the Effective Time, in the manner described in
this Section 3.05. The Company shall, prior to the completion of the Offer,
amend the Equity Plans as necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
The Equity Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and any and all
rights under any provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall

     

   

be canceled upon the completion of the Offer. All administrative and other
rights and authorities granted under any Equity Plan to the Company, the
Company Board or any Committee or designee thereof, shall, following the
Effective Time, reside with the Surviving Corporation.

With respect to any Section of this Article IV, except (i) as disclosed in

Company with the SEC or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in each case on
or after November 20, 2005 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Existing Company SEC Reports_ ") (to the extent such disclosure does not
constitute a "risk factor" (other than factual information contained therein)
and to the extent applicability of such disclosure to such Section is
reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) as set forth in the section of the
disclosure letter dated the date hereof and delivered by the Company
to Parent with respect to this Agreement (the " _Disclosure Letter_ ")
that specifically relates to such Section or another Section of the
Disclosure Letter to the extent that the applicability of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face, the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Purchaser as follows:

  

SECTION 4.01. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a corporation or
other business entity duly organized and validly existing in good standing or
has comparable status under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation,
formation or organization, as applicable. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate or similar organizational power
and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as currently
conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good
standing or has comparable status as a foreign entity authorized to do
business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character of the
properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business
transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where any such
failures to be so qualified and in good standing have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.10(d)). The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent and Purchaser accurate and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar governing documents) as
currently in effect for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Neither the

nonassessable and are free of preemptive rights. Section 4.02(a) of the
Disclosure Letter contains a true, accurate and complete list, as of the
close of business on the day immediately preceding the date hereof, of the

stock of the Company, being referred to collectively as " _Company
Securities_ ") or (iv) obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to make any payments based on the price or value of the Shares.  Neither the

Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming due authorization and execution and valid delivery by each of
Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

  

SECTION 4.04. _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_. Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provision of the respective certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or other similar governing documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (b) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,

SECTION 4.05. _Reports; Financial Statements_. (a) Since January 1, 2004 the
Company has timely filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the SEC, all of which have complied as to form, as of their

Company and its Subsidiaries as of their respective dates, and the
consolidated income, stockholders equity, results of operations and changes

SECTION 6.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall not permit its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives (including investment
bankers, attorneys and accountants) and agents to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, participate in any way in, or knowingly encourage any
discussions or negotiations with respect to, or provide any information, or
afford any access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise take any action to knowingly assist or
facilitate, any Person or group in respect of, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below).
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the prior execution by such Person or
group of a confidentiality agreement that is no less favorable to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (other than the exclusivity and
"standstill" provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that in the event that the Company enters into a confidentiality
agreement with a person making an Acquisition Proposal that does not include
a "standstill" provision or contains a "standstill" provision less favorable
to the Company than the corresponding provision of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent and its Affiliates shall, without further action by the
Company, be released from the "standstill" provision under Section 7 of the
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent necessary to render such "standstill"
provision of the Confidentiality Agreement no more favorable to the Company
than the "standstill," if any, applicable to the person making such
Acquisition Proposal), the Company may, at any time prior to the purchase of
Shares pursuant to the Offer, furnish information (so long as all such
information has previously been made available to Parent or is made available
to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is made available to such
Person or group) to or enter into discussions or negotiations with any Person
or group that has made an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal not
resulting from a breach of this Section 6.02 received after the date hereof
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside financial advisor and outside counsel and after taking into account
the legal, financial, financing, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal, to the extent known) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal if, and only to the extent that the Company concurrently
provides Parent written notice that it is taking such actions.

  

(b) The Company will promptly (and in any event within two Business Days)
notify Parent and Purchaser, orally and in writing, if any such information
is requested or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be
initiated with respect to such an Acquisition Proposal and such notice will
communicate to Parent and Purchaser the identity of the Person or group
making such request or inquiry (the " _Potential Acquiror_ ") and the
material terms of such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. The Company
will keep Parent and Purchaser reasonably informed of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations and shall promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days) notify Parent and Purchaser orally and in writing of any
modifications to the financial or other material terms of any such request,
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.

  

(c) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will cause its
and their respective officers, directors and employees and direct its and
their representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions, or negotiations with any
Persons other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or
Associates conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any

     

   

Acquisition Proposal and to the extent permitted to do so withdraws any
request or consent theretofore given to the making of an Acquisition
Proposal.

  

(d) Unless and until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01 and except as expressly permitted by Section 6.02(e) or (f),
neither the Company nor the Company Board shall (i) withdraw, modify or
qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval or recommendation of the Offer
or the Merger as described in Section 1.02(a)(ii), (ii) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
release any third party from any confidentiality (in the context of an
Acquisition Proposal) or standstill agreement to which the Company is a
party, or grant any waiver, request or consent to any Acquisition Proposal
under, any such agreement, (iv) redeem the Rights or amend, or take any other
action with respect to, the Rights Agreement (A) to facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal or (B) to permit any Person other than Parent or
Purchaser to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Shares or (v)
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement with a
Person making an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.02(a)) related to
any Acquisition Proposal.  Without limiting any other rights of Parent and
Purchaser under this Agreement in respect of any such action, any withdrawal
or modification by the Company of the approval or recommendation of the Offer
or the Merger shall not have any effect on the approvals of, and other
actions referred to herein for the purpose of causing Takeover Laws, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Rights Agreement to be inapplicable to,
this Agreement ** __** and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.02(d) the Company Board may
withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, its recommendation of
the Offer or the Merger as set forth in Section 1.02(a)(ii) if the Company
Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, including its duties of good faith and candor to
the Companys stockholders and, in the case where such determination is made
in response to an Acquisition Proposal made and not withdrawn prior to such
determination, the Company has provided Parent prior written notice of its
intent to take such action not less than two Business Days prior to taking
such action.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel)
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, including
its duty of candor to the stockholders of the Company, or violate its
obligations under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such action
will be deemed to constitute a modification or qualification of the
recommendation of the Offer or the Merger unless the Company Board expressly
reaffirms its recommendation of the Offer or the Merger, as the case may be,
in connection with such disclosure if so requested by Parent.

     

   

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer or
proposal, made in writing by a Person or group at any time which is
structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of
at least 15% of the assets of, equity interest in, or businesses of, the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole pursuant to a
merger, recapitalization, consolidation or other business combination, sale
of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or
similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series
of related transactions, in each case other than the Offer and the Merger and
(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal (except the reference therein to "15%" shall be replaced
by "50%") that is on terms that the Company Board has reasonably determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisor and
outside counsel and after taking into account the legal, financial,
financing, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal) would result in a
transaction that (x) is more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the
Offer and the Merger, and (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the
terms proposed.

  

SECTION 6.03. (a) _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) From
and after the date of this Agreement upon reasonable prior written notice
and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement the Company will
(i) give Parent and Purchaser and their authorized accountants, investment
bankers, counsel and other representatives reasonable access (during regular
business hours upon reasonable notice) to members of the Companys
management, plants, offices, warehouses and other facilities and to all
books, contracts, commitments and records (including Tax returns) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries
independent public accountants to provide access to their work papers and
such other information as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request, (ii)
permit Parent and Purchaser to make such reasonable inspections as they may
reasonably require, and (iii) cause its officers and those of its
Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Purchaser with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the business, properties
and Personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Purchaser may
from time to time reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such investigation or consultation shall not include any invasive testing or
environmental sampling of any kind and shall be conducted in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their
normal duties. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its
Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to put in place an arrangement to permit such disclosure without loss
of attorney-client privilege, to the extent possible) or contravene any law
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
(provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to permit
such disclosure without contravening such law or violating such agreement).
No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.03 or otherwise shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement or any condition to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

  

(b) Information obtained by Parent or Purchaser and their respective
officers, employees, auditors, accounts and other authorized representatives
pursuant to Section 6.03(a) shall be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

   

40   

 

  

SECTION 6.04. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each
of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make promptly any required submissions under the HSR Act, any required
submissions under the Canadian Competition Act, the submissions under the
1988 Exon-Florio Amendment to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended
(the " _Exon-Florio Act_ "), the requisite notifications under the ITAR with
the United States Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade and
Controls and any submissions under any applicable foreign antitrust or
competition laws that are required to be made or which the Company and Parent
mutually agree should be made, in each case, with respect to the Offer, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) Parent, Purchaser
and the Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining
whether any filings are required to be or should be made or consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained
under any other supranational, national, federal, state or local law or
regulation or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
or should be obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other
contracts or instruments material to the Companys business in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any consents, permits,
authorizations, approvals or waivers required to be made or which the Company
and Parent mutually agree should be made.

  

(b) In the event that any action, suit, proceeding or investigation relating
hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby is commenced, whether
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to defend vigorously against it and respond
thereto and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

SECTION 6.05. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)  Parent and Purchaser
agree that, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the
articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification of the present or former directors, officers and
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries than are currently
provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the
articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, as the case may be, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until the expiration of
the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters or unless such
amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable law. Without
limiting the foregoing, all obligations of the Company (including with
respect to change of control payments and rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses)) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in all existing

     

   

indemnification and change of control agreements with the Companys directors
and officers shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect as obligations of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with their
terms. Prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Company will
provide such letters of credit securing the Companys obligations pursuant to
such change of control agreements as are required by the terms thereof.

  

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
agreement or Plan, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the
Effective Time) and former officer and director of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements,
incurred in connection with any proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law and the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the event of any such
proceeding, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of the proceeding from the Surviving
Corporation within ten Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation
from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor.

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation will cause to be maintained in effect for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (but only in respect thereof), policies
of directors and officers liability insurance, or a six-year tail insurance
policy, covering the Persons currently covered by the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies and providing coverage
at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as such existing policies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be required
in order to maintain such directors and officers liability insurance
policies to pay aggregate premiums in excess of 150% of the aggregate annual
amounts currently paid by the Company to maintain the existing policies
(which amount is as set forth in Schedule 6.05); and _provided further_ that,
if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of 150% of such annual amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be
obtained by paying aggregate premiums equal to 150% of such annual amount.

  

(d) This Section 6.05 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, any Person or entity
referred to in clause (a) of this Section 6.05 (whether or not parties to
this Agreement). If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting
from such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume the applicable obligations set forth
in this Section 6.05.

  

SECTION 6.06. _Employee Matters_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, except
as set forth below, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and
from and after the

     

   

Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor, in accordance with their terms all existing employment and severance
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer,
director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries specified in
Section 4.09(a) of the Disclosure Letter.

  

(b) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, until
the first anniversary of the Effective Time, to provide compensation,
pension, welfare and other benefits to their employees (considered as a
group, but excluding for this purpose employees covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, who shall continue to be governed by the terms of the
collective bargaining agreement applicable to such employee), which benefits
will be, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those currently provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries in the aggregate to such employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding, for this purpose, equity-
based compensation). It is the current intention of the Parent to cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide a long-term incentive plan to retain key
employees of the Surviving Corporation.  Nothing in this Section 6.06(b)
shall be deemed to constitute an amendment of any Plan or to prevent the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from making any change in
any Plan, including any change required by law or deemed necessary or
appropriate to comply with applicable law or regulation. Nothing in this
Section 6.06(b) shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee at any
time.

  

(c) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to give each employee of the
Company credit, for purposes of the Surviving Corporations vacation and/or
other paid leave benefit programs, for such employees accrued and unpaid
vacation and/or paid leave balance as of the Effective Time, but in no event
will the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be obligated to extend or
enlarge the benefits available under such programs.

  

(d) The Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all action necessary, as
promptly hereafter as reasonably practicable, to amend any Plan maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to eliminate, as of the date hereof,
all provisions for the purchase from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of Company Securities or Subsidiary Securities.

  

(e) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time to be taken into account for vesting and eligibility purposes
(but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, if
applicable) under employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent
as such service was taken into account under the corresponding Plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for those purposes. Employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries will not be subject to any pre-existing condition
limitation under any health plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to
coverage under the corresponding plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which they participated prior to the Effective Time.  Parent will, and will
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to give such employees
credit under such plans for co-payments made and deductibles satisfied prior
to the Effective Time.

     

   

(f) This _Section 6.06_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.06_
, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
6.06_.

  

(g) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in
accordance with their respective terms the Collective Bargaining Agreements
dated September 10, 2004, between Rocky Mountain Steel Mills and USWA, on
behalf of Local Union 2102, Local Union 3267 and Local Union 3267 (Plant
Protection) and, with respect to any other Collective Bargaining Agreements
used in Section 4.09(p) of the Disclosure Letter, to the extent required by
applicable law.

  

(h) At least one Business Day prior to its distribution, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall provide Parent and Purchaser with a copy of any
communication relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
intended to be distributed broadly to any of their respective employees, and
shall provide Purchaser an opportunity to make reasonable revisions thereto.

  

(i) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the annual bonuses to
employees in respect of fiscal year 2006 in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Plan and consistent with past practice; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board shall defer to the good
faith determination of the chief executive officer of the Company that the
timing and calculation of any such bonuses is consistent with the terms of
the Plan and in accordance with past practice.

  

SECTION 6.07. _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall, upon the request of
Parent or Purchaser, take all reasonable steps to exclude the applicability
of, or to assist in any challenge by Parent or Purchaser to the validity,
or applicability to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement of, any Takeover Laws.

  

SECTION 6.08. _Information Statement_. Unless the Merger is consummated
in accordance with Section 253 of the Corporation Law as contemplated
by Section 2.09, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, subject
to the prior review and approval of Parent and Purchaser (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld), as soon as practicable after the
consummation of the Offer, a preliminary Information Statement pursuant to
Section 14(c) of the Exchange Act (the " _Preliminary Information Statement_
") relating to the Merger as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information
required to be included in the Preliminary Information Statement, shall
provide Parent and Purchaser with, and consult with Parent and Purchaser
regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with
respect thereto, shall, subject to the prior review and approval of Parent
and Purchaser (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), respond
promptly to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Preliminary Information Statement, and shall cause the
Information Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders at the
earliest practicable date. If at any time prior to the Closing, any
information relating to the Offer, the Merger, the Company, Parent, Purchaser
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Information Statement, so that the

     

   

Information Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  

SECTION 6.09. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Purchaser, and Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be,
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which results
in a breach or failure of any representation, warranty or covenant of such
party contained in this Agreement (substituting "material effect on the
Company" for "Material Adverse Effect" wherever "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifies any such representation, warranty or covenant and, _provided_ ,
that if any such representation, warranty or covenant does not contain a
materiality qualifier, such breach or failure must be material); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.09
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any
of the parties receiving such notice. This Section 6.09 shall not constitute
an obligation, covenant or agreement for purposes of Sections
8.01(c)(i),8.01(d)(i) or paragraph 2(c) of Exhibit A.

  

SECTION 6.10. _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant
party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the
final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) shall have used its reasonable best efforts
to contest and remove such order, decree, ruling or action;

  

(c) by the Company if (i) Parent or Purchaser breaches or fails to perform in
any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
give rise to a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Purchaser
to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after
the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach, (ii) Purchaser shall
not have accepted for payment and paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer in
accordance with the terms thereof on or before the date that is four months
from the date of the commencement of the Offer (the " _Outside Date_ ") or
the Offer shall have expired or been terminated without Purchaser having
purchased any Shares pursuant thereto or (iii) Purchaser fails to purchase
validly tendered Shares in violation of the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 8.01(c) if the Company is
then in material breach of any of its covenants contained in this Agreement
or pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 8.01(c) if the failure of
Purchaser to commence the Offer or to accept for payment and pay for Shares
pursuant to the Offer by the Outside Date or such expiration or termination
of the Offer resulted from the Companys failure to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

  

(d) by Parent if (i) the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in paragraph 2(c) of Exhibit A and (B)
cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the

     

   

giving of written notice to the Company of such breach, or (ii) Purchaser
shall not have accepted for payment Shares pursuant to the Offer prior to the
Outside Date or the Offer shall have expired or been terminated without
Purchaser having purchased any Shares pursuant thereto _provided_ , that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
clause (i) of this Section 8.01(d) if either Parent or Purchaser is then in
material breach of any of its covenants contained in this Agreement or
pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 8.01(d) if the failure of Purchaser
to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer by the Outside
Date or such expiration or termination of the Offer resulted from Parents or
Purchasers failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

  

(e) by the Company, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, if
(i) the Company has complied with its obligations under Section 6.02, (ii)
(A) the Company has given Parent and Purchaser at least three Business Days
advance written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") of its intention
to accept or recommend a Superior Proposal and of all of the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (B) Parent and Purchaser do not
within three Business Days of receipt by Parent and Purchaser of the Notice
of Superior Proposal, make an offer that the Company Board determines, in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel) to be at least as favorable to the stockholders of
the Company as such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that during such three
Business Day period, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
and Purchaser (to the extent that Parent and Purchaser wish to negotiate) to
enable Parent and Purchaser to make such an offer; and _provided_ , _further_
, that, in the event of any amendment to the financial or other material
terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall deliver to Parent
and Purchaser an additional written Notice of Superior Proposal, and the
three Business Day period referenced above shall be extended for an
additional two Business Days after Parents and Purchasers receipt of each
such additional Notice of Superior Proposal, (iii) the Companys Board of
Directors, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of the
Offer and the Merger agreed to by Parent and Purchaser after receipt of such
notice, continues to believe such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (iv) on the date of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement for the transaction contemplated by such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that the termination described in this Section 8.01(e)
shall not be effective unless and until the Company shall have paid to Parent
the Expenses and the Termination Fee described in Section 8.03;

  

(f) by Parent, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, (i) if
the Company breaches Section 6.02 in any material respect or (ii) if the
Company takes any of the actions referred to in Section 6.02(e) of this
Agreement or the Company Board shall have resolved to take any of such
actions; or

  

(g) by Parent, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, if
since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have occurred any change,
condition, event or development that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and
the Merger is abandoned pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement, except
for the provisions of Sections 6.03(b), 8.02, 8.03 and Article IX (which
shall remain in effect), shall forthwith become

     

   

void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party or
its directors, officers or stockholders. Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall
relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for any willful breach of
this Agreement.

  

SECTION 8.03. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Offer, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(e), then the Company shall reimburse Parent for all of the out-
of-pocket expenses of Parent and the Purchaser (including printing fees,
filing fees and expenses of its legal, financial and other advisors) related
to the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and any related financing up to a maximum of $8,000,000 (collectively,
the " _Expenses_ ") and pay Parent a termination fee equal to $68,000,000
less the amount of any Expenses actually reimbursed to Parent (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), in each case, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account designated by Parent. If such amounts become
payable, they shall be payable simultaneously with such termination.

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.01(f)(ii), the Company shall reimburse Parent for the Expenses and
pay Parent the Termination Fee, in each case, in immediately available funds
by wire transfer to an account designated by Parent on the Business Day
following such termination.

  

(d) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(c)(ii) (unless the matters giving rise to such termination are due to
Parents or Purchasers breach of their covenants) or 8.01(d)(ii); (ii) prior
to the event giving rise to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made or publicly announced; and (iii) as of the event giving rise
to such termination, the only condition to the Offer that was not satisfied
was the Minimum Tender Condition then (x) upon such termination the Company
shall reimburse Parent for the Expenses and (y) if within 12 months following
the date of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
consummated or the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (any such event described in clause
(y), a " _Subsequent Transaction_ "), then the Company shall pay Parent the
Termination Fee.  For purposes of the definition of Subsequent Transaction
and this Section 8.03, each reference to 15% in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be replaced with a reference to 50%.  

  

(e) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(d)(i) and (ii) prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made or publicly announced then (x) upon such termination the
Company shall reimburse Parent for the Expenses and (y) if within 12 months
following the date of such termination, there is a Subsequent Transaction,
then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee.

  

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(f)(i) then (x) upon such termination the Company shall reimburse Parent
for the Expenses

     

   

and (y) if within 12 months following the date of such termination there is a
Subsequent Transaction, then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination
Fee.

  

(g) Any Expenses or Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.03(d), (e)
or (f) shall be payable in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by Parent. If any amounts become payable pursuant
to clause (x) of Section 8.03(d), (e) or (f), then they shall be
payable simultaneously with such termination (in the case of a termination by
the Company) or within one Business Day thereafter (in the case of a
termination by Parent). If such amounts become payable pursuant to clause
(y) of Section 8.03(d), (e) or (f), they shall be payable simultaneously with
the earlier of completion of such Acquisition Proposal and the Companys
entering into such a definitive agreement.

  

(h) For purposes of this Section 8.03, this Agreement shall be deemed
terminated by Parent pursuant to a provision giving rise to the obligation to
pay the Termination Fee or the Expenses if at the time of any termination
hereunder Parent was so entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to such
provision; _provided_ that solely for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
shall not be required to pay the Expenses or the Termination Fee pursuant to
more than one clause of this Section 8.03.

  

(i) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Purchaser would
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that the Company
shall fail to reimburse the Expenses or pay the Termination Fee when due, and
in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit or other proceeding
which results in a judgment or similar award against the Company for
reimbursement of the Expenses or payment of the Termination Fee, then the
Company shall reimburse Parent for its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement)
in connection with such suit or proceeding, together with interest on the
amounts owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published
in the Wall Street Journal, plus two percent per annum from the date such
amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent.

  

SECTION 8.04. _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, this
Agreement may be amended by action taken by or on behalf of the Boards
of Directors of the Company, Parent and Purchaser, subject in the case of
the Company to Section 1.04(b), at any time before or after adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company but, after any such
stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger
Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Companys
stockholders hereunder without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company. This Agreement may not be amended, changed, supplemented or
otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all
of the parties.

  

SECTION 8.05. _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. (a) At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken by or on behalf of the
respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Purchaser, subject
in the case of the Company to Section 1.04(b), may (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained

     

   

herein by any other applicable party or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
 Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

  

(b) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or
otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative
and not alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not
preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or
remedy by such party. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any rights,
power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in
respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other
party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of
the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver
by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or
remedy or to demand such compliance.

  

ARTICLE IX 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS

  

SECTION 9.01. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The
representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall not survive
beyond the Effective Time. This Section 9.01 shall not limit any covenant or
agreement of the parties hereto which by its terms contemplates performance
after the Effective Time.

  

SECTION 9.02. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to subject matter hereof
and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties with respect to subject matter hereof.  The
Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by operation of law or otherwise
without the prior written consent of the other parties, _provided_ , that
Parent or Purchaser may assign any of their respective rights and obligations
to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent so long as such assignment
shall not materially adversely affect the Company, the holders of the Shares,
Options or Equity Awards in their capacity as such, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, of its obligations
hereunder.

  

SECTION 9.03. _Enforcement of the Agreement; Jurisdiction_. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in any New York state court located in the Borough of
Manhattan, City of New York or any Federal court located in such Borough,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any New York state court located in
the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York or any Federal court located in
such Borough in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other

     

   

request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than any such court and (d) waives any right to
trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the courts of the State of New York
located in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York or in any Federal court
located in such Borough, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.  Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser hereby agrees
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered
mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.05 shall be effective
service of process for any proceeding in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent hereby irrevocably appoints CSC
Corporation Service Company, at its office at 1133 Avenue of the Americas,
Suite 3100 New York, NY 10036, its lawful agent and attorney to accept and
acknowledge service of any and all process against it in any action, suit or
proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement and upon whom such
process may be served, with the same effect as if Parent were a resident of
the State of New York and had been lawfully served with such process in such
jurisdiction. In the case of any service by the Company upon such agent and
attorney, the Company shall also deliver a copy thereof to Parent at the
address and in the manner specified in Section 9.05. In the event that such
agent and attorney resigns or otherwise becomes incapable of acting as such,
Parent will appoint a successor agent and attorney in New York, New York with
like powers.

  

SECTION 9.04. ** _ _**_Validity_ ** _. _**Whenever possible, each provision
or portion of any provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such
manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law but if any provision
or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid,
or unenforceable under any present or future applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and if
the rights or obligations under this Agreement of the Company on the one
hand, and Parent and Purchaser on the other hand, will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, (a) this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never comprised a
part hereof and (b) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in
full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement. If any
provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

SECTION 9.05. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be given (and shall be deemed to have
been duly received if given) by hand delivery in writing or by

or divestitures of certain operations as a result or consequence of its
review by the CFIUS, in the case of each of (x), (y) and (z) to the
extent that such restrictions would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on (A) the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the corporate governance of the
Company; _provided_ , that Parent and Purchaser shall have complied with
their obligations under Section 6.04 of the Merger Agreement;

  

(b) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have occurred any
change, condition, event or development that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse

not be reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, _provided_ ,
that Parent shall not then be in material breach of any of its covenants
contained in this Agreement; or

  

(d) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms or
shall have been amended pursuant to its terms to provide for such termination
or amendment of the Offer;

  

which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any case, and
regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent
or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates

     

   

that is not otherwise prohibited by law (including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act) or by this Agreement) giving rise to any such condition, makes
it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance for payment or
payment for Shares.

  

The foregoing conditions are for the benefit of Parent and Purchaser and,
regardless of the circumstances, may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser in
whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time prior to the
Expiration Date, except that the conditions relating to receipt of any
approvals from any Governmental Entity may be asserted at any time prior to
the acceptance for payment of Shares, and all conditions (except for the
Minimum Tender Condition) may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in its
discretion in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time,
in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent
or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not
be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
