Purchaser shall extend the Offer for a period of five Business Days, in order

attempt to cure such breach of its representations and warranties, or failure

expiration of such cure period, or such earlier date as specified by the
Company in its request; and (4) if, within four Business Days prior to any
Expiration Date occurring on or before January 4, 2007, the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal (or a revision to a previously received Acquisition
Proposal) that is still pending as of such Expiration Date, then upon written
request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer if necessary so that
the Expiration Date does not occur until the later of (x) the date that is five
Business Days following the date of the Company&#146;s initial receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal (or such revision to a previously received Acquisition
Proposal) and (y) the last Business Day of any required notice period pursuant
to Section 6.02(e) or 8.01(e), or such earlier date as specified by the Company

applicable, the Offer shall be so extended further.&#160; In addition, in the event that fewer than 90%
of the total number of outstanding Shares have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn, Purchaser shall, if requested by the Company on the Expiration Date,
make available a subsequent offering period in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the
Exchange Act for a period of time determined by Parent, but not less than five
Business Days.&#160; For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto agree that shares of restricted stock may be tendered
in the Offer and be acquired by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.&#160; The Offer Price may be increased and the
Offer may be extended to the extent required by law in connection with such
increase in each case without the consent of the Company.&#160; Notwithstanding the foregoing Purchaser shall
not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.</font></p>
