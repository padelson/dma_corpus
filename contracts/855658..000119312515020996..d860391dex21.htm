v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of January 26, 2015 by and among Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Cayabyab Merger Company, a Delaware
corporation and a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and Silicon Image, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "). All capitalized terms that are used in this Agreement but not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in _Annex
A_.

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in order to effect the foregoing acquisition, Parent and the Company
have agreed that Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ")
to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price of Seven Dollars
and Thirty Cents ($7.30) per Company Share, net to the holder thereof in cash,
without any interest thereon and subject to any required withholding Taxes
(such amount, or any higher amount per Company Share that may be paid pursuant
to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), all
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

WHEREAS, in order to complete the foregoing acquisition, as soon as
practicable following the completion of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the DGCL and
each Company Share (other than Company Shares owned by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub or Dissenting Company Shares) that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, and the
Company will survive the Merger as a direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to be effected under Section
251(h) of the DGCL pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, each of the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub
has approved the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, of this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, of their respective covenants and agreements contained herein
and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject
to the conditions contained herein;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
taken together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (iii) approved this
Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, which approval, to the extent applicable,
render Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to Parent and Merger Sub, (iv)
resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer, tender
their Company Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") and (v) resolved to elect that any "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of
anti-takeover Laws or regulations (including Section 203 of the DGCL) of any
jurisdiction that purports to be applicable to the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or
the Support Agreements, shall not be applicable to the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement
(clauses (i) through (v) collectively, the " _Board Actions_ ");

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company, in their respective
capacities as stockholders of the Company, are entering into Support
Agreements with Parent   (each, a " _Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Support
Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the signatories thereto are agreeing to,
subject to the terms and conditions of such agreements, tender their Company
Shares into the Offer and to take (and refrain from taking) certain other
actions in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to prescribe certain
conditions with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
as well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

increase of more than $500,000, in the aggregate, of the Merger Consideration
paid to the Company Stockholders plus the aggregated amount paid pursuant to
the Offer; or (C) any of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement (other than the Specified Representations and the

sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and, accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub

discretion. The failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise the
foregoing right to waive any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum

shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.

(i) Parent and Merger Sub may, and hereby expressly reserve the right to,
increase the Offer Price or otherwise amend, modify or make changes to the

Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (the " _Expiration Time_ ").

cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments
of not more than 10 Business Days each, until the earlier of (1) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (2) the Outside
Date; _provided however_ that if, as of any then scheduled Expiration Time,
the only Offer Condition that has not been satisfied is the Minimum Condition

Acceptance Time; provided that if, notwithstanding such express election to
cause the Merger to be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the Merger

portion of the CompanyÂ’s or ParentÂ’s assets or sales shall have (i) enacted,

Law that is in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and has
the effect of making the Merger illegal or which has the effect of
prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Merger or (ii)
issued or granted any judgment, decree, injunction or other Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time and has the effect of making the Merger illegal or
prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Merger.

 

2.3 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, subject to
compliance with _Section 6.10_, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated certificate of
incorporation shall become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation.

 



9 (b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, subject to compliance with  _Section
6.10_, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the

thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such
bylaws.

2.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(b) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving

2.6 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations_.

conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or the holders of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) _Company Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each Company Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled
Company Shares and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash
amount equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without any
interest thereon and subject to any required withholding Taxes. The Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Shares), cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Shares occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled, extinguished and cease to exist, and each holder
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing any Company
Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares) shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable therefor upon the surrender or transfer thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 2.7_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be

 



10  deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary
settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time; and if,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(ii) _Canceled Company Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the
holders of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each Company
Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise) (" _Canceled Company Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) Dissenting Company Shares.

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted
in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly and validly exercised and perfected their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.6_. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled
to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the
DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to any required
withholding Taxes, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section
2.7_.

 

(B) The Company shall give Parent (1) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (2) the opportunity and right (at
ParentÂ’s sole election) to direct and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

2.7 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than one (1) Business Day after the Effective Time), Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) the aggregate

 



11  Merger Consideration with the Payment Agent, for payment to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ (such cash amount
being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates
representing Company Shares (other than Canceled Company Shares and Dissenting
Company Shares) (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares
other than Canceled Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares represented
by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (other than Canceled
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form as agreed to between the Company and Parent prior to the
consummation of the Offer (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the
Payment Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_. Upon (i) surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) receipt of an "agentÂ’s
message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer
as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a transfer of
Book-Entry Shares, the holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of each Company Share formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ , and the Certificates so surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so
transferred shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.7_.

the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any

deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or non-U.S.

other disclosures contained therein that are predictive, cautionary or forward
looking in nature or any disclosures contained under the caption "ManagementÂ’s

only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the text of such
reports in the foregoing that such disclosure is applicable to any section or
subsection of this _Article III_ ; _provided, however,_ that the foregoing
clause (x) shall not apply to the representations and warranties set forth in

specifically corresponds to

 



13  the section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule in which any

this _Article III_ only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the
text of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
section or subsection of this _Article III_ , the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware Law. The Company has the requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease or operate its properties and assets except where the failure to
have such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the
"good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside
the United States), except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent (i) true, correct and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other constituent
governing documents, as amended to date, of the Company and (ii) true, correct
and complete copies in all material respects of the minutes (or, in the case
of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings, and any
action taken by written consent, of the Company Stockholders, the Company
Board and each committee of the Company Board, for which minutes (or drafts)
have been prepared, excluding any minutes related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and any minutes related to the solicitation
or discussion of proposals to acquire the Company and related strategic
process, in each case occurring at any time during the two (2) years prior to

of incorporation or bylaws in any material respect.

this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
perform its obligations hereunder, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions of Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby

this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby

appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and as set forth in
_Section 3.3_, and assuming the conditions of Section 251(h) of the DGCL
have been satisfied.

(c) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board has, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein unanimously resolved to adopt each of the Board Actions,
which have not subsequently been rescinded or modified in any way. Prior to
making the determinations and effecting the approvals set forth in this
_Section 3.2(c)_, the Company Board has received the opinion of Barclays
Capital Inc. to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and subject
to the various assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the
consideration to be offered to the holders of the Company Shares in the
proposed Offer and Merger, together and not separately, is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified.

 



14 (d) At a meeting duly called and held at which all members of the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_
") were present, the Compensation Committee (i) duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (A) each Company Stock Plan, (B) the
treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs in accordance with the terms set
forth in this Agreement, the applicable Company Stock Plan and any applicable
Employee Plan, (C) the terms of _Section 6.9,_ and (D) each other Employee
Plan that under the terms of this Agreement is required to be set forth
in Section 3.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule which resolutions have
not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way and (ii) has taken all
other actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act with
respect to the foregoing arrangements. Each member of the Compensation
Committee is an "independent director" within the meaning of the requirements
of Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(e) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of
equity.

any federal or state securities Laws, including compliance with any
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (c) Consents required under, and
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws and (d) such other Consents, the failure of which to
obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.4 _Conflicts_. Assuming the conditions of Section 251(h) of the DGCL have
been satisfied and that the Consents set forth in  _Section 3.3_ have been
obtained or made, the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of
this Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and the compliance
by the Company with any of the provisions hereof do not and will not (a)

other constituent governing documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (b) except as set forth in _Section 3.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, violate, conflict with, or result in the breach of or

the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or result in the right to modify any of the material
terms in, any Material Contract, (c) violate or conflict with any applicable
Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which

assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 

4.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Parent is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
the requisite power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently
being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and
assets. Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being
conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or
leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to
the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations
hereunder (including the Offer and the Merger). The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate or
other proceeding on the part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to
authorize, adopt or approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Offer and the Merger). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable
against each in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability
(a) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to creditorsÂ’ rights
generally and (b) is subject to general principles of equity. 

4.3 _Required Governmental Consents_. No Consent of any Governmental Authority
is required on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger
Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), except

Secretary of State and such filings with Governmental Authorities to satisfy
the applicable Law of states in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
are qualified to do business, (b) such filings and approvals as may be
required by any federal or state securities laws, including compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (c) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and applicable requirements under
foreign Antitrust Laws and (d) such other Consents, the failure of which to
obtain would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

4.4 _Conflicts_. The execution, delivery or performance by Parent and Merger
Sub of this Agreement, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and the
compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with any of the provisions hereof do not
and will not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Merger Sub (b) violate, conflict with, or result in the breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or

accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,
agreement or other instrument, obligation or other Contract to which Parent
and Merger Sub, as the case may be, is a party or by which it or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, (c) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in  _Section 4.3_, violate or conflict with

 



36  any Law, Order or any rule or regulation of any securities exchange on which
ParentÂ’s common stock is listed for trading applicable to Parent or Merger Sub
or by which any of their properties or assets are bound, (d) result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger
Sub, except in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for such
violations, conflicts, defaults, terminations, accelerations or Liens which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.5 _Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9_.

 

(a) The Offer Documents, when filed with the SEC, will comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
At the time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, amended or
supplemented or first published, sent or given to the Company Stockholders,
and immediately prior to the Expiration Time, the Offer Documents will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading;  _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,
no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
information supplied by the Company or any of its officers, directors,
Affiliates, representatives, agents or employees in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents.

(b) None of the information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or their officers,
directors, representatives, agents or employees expressly for inclusion in the

Company Stockholders or at the Expiration Time, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

4.6 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is,
nor at any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than
as contemplated by this Agreement).

 

4.7 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete fully
executed copies of the commitment letter, dated as of January 26, 2015 among
Parent and Jefferies Finance LLC, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments to such letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the
" _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof each of the parties thereto (other than Parent) have
severally committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent (the "

prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement except as permitted
pursuant to _Section 6.15_. As of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. There are no conditions
precedent or contingencies (other than pursuant to the "market flex"
provisions of the Fee Letter (as defined in the Commitment Letter), a true and
complete copy of which (redacted in a manner acceptable to the Financing
Parties only as to the matters indicated therein) has been provided to the
Company by Parent) related to the obligations of the Financing Parties to
fund the full amount of the Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter, other
than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letter, Parent and Merger Sub will have at the
Offer Closing and the Closing, sufficient cash on hand, together with the net
proceeds contemplated from the Financing, sufficient for the satisfaction of
all of ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s obligations under this Agreement, including
the aggregate Offer Price and the aggregate Merger Consideration. As of the
date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which would constitute a
material breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a default) on the part of Parent under the Commitment
Letter or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Commitment
Letter, and (ii) subject to the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing and
any other funds necessary for the satisfaction of all of 

 



37  ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s obligations under this Agreement and the payment
of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection
therewith will not be available to Parent at the Acceptance Time. Except for
fee letters with respect to fees and related arrangements with respect to the
Financing, of which Parent has delivered a true, correct and complete copy to
the Company prior to the date hereof (other than with respect to redacted fee
information, but which fee information does not relate to the amounts
(excluding any "market flex", including the form of original issue discount or
upfront fees) or conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to,
the funding of the Financing), as of the date hereof there are no side letters
or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements related to the Financing, or
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letter and delivered to the Company prior to the
date hereof. Parent has fully paid or will fully pay all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid in connection with the Financing.

 

4.8 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no claim, suit, action, proceeding,
investigation of any nature or other Legal Proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary
of Parent challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), which, if
adversely determined, would, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.9 _Cash; Indebtedness_. Parent and its subsidiaries, collectively, have at
least $225 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Parent has outstanding no
material indebtedness for borrowed money or preferred stock (or direct or
indirect guarantee or other credit support in respect thereof) other than, at

Commitment Letter.

 

4.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this _Article IV_ , none of Parent, Merger Sub or
any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or

Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, (ii) participate or engage in
discussions (other than to refer to the provisions of this Section 6.1) or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub or any designees
of Parent or Merger Sub) regarding any proposal or transaction that
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Transaction, or furnish any non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

proposal or transaction that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, (iii) enter into

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (v) except to the

portion of Section 203 of the DGCL in respect of any Person (other than

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_, prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, directly or indirectly through
advisors, agents or other intermediaries, subject to the CompanyÂ’s compliance
with the provisions of this _Section 6.1_, (A) engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations with any Person that has made (and not withdrawn)
a _bona fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor of nationally
recognized standing and its outside legal counsel) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to any Person
that has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal
any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement the terms of which are no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement which non-disclosure agreement shall not include any provisions that
would prevent or restrict the Company or the

 



42  Company Representatives from providing any information to Parent to which
Parent would be entitled under any provision of this Agreement (and the
Company shall be permitted to negotiate and enter into such a non-disclosure
agreement) unless the Company shall, prior to December 21, 2014, already be a
party to such an agreement with such third party and shall not include any
provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such third party;
_provided, however_ , that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B), (1) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have breached or violated the terms of this _Section 6.1_
or _Section 6.2_, (2) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders
under Delaware Law, (3) prior to taking any of the actions set forth in
clauses (A) or (B), the Company gives Parent written notice containing the
information set forth in  _Section 6.1(d)_ to the extent available _,_ and
of the CompanyÂ’s intention to take such actions and (4) contemporaneously with
furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes
such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished by the Company to Parent). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge
and hereby agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 6.1_ by any Company Representative shall constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.1_ by the Company. In addition, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Company may, following the receipt of an
Alternative Proposal, contact the Person who has made such Alternative
Proposal to clarify and understand the terms and conditions thereof so as to
determine whether such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal.

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in  _Section
6.1(b)_, the Company shall as promptly as practicable _,_ and in all cases
within twenty four (24) hours of its receipt, advise Parent in writing of (i)
any _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction or (iii) any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, in each case, including
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction, request or inquiry (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in
written form, in which case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof),
and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry; provided that the Company may redact, and not disclose,
the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal if
disclosure of such identity would violate the terms of an existing non-
disclosure agreement. The Company shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably
informed of the status, (including all material amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition
to the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with at least twenty-four
(24) hours (or such lesser notice as the Company Board or committee receives)
prior written notice of a meeting of the Company Board at which the Company
Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction, an inquiry relating to a potential Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or a request to provide nonpublic
information to any Person in relation to an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction.

6.2 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.2_, the Company Board shall (i)
make the Company Board Recommendation and (ii) include the Company Board
Recommendation (with respect to the Offer) in the Schedule 14D-9 and permit
Parent to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

 

(b) Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.2_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, (iii) following
the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is
first made public or sent or given to the Company Stockholders, fail to issue
a press release reaffirming

 



43  the Company Board Recommendation within three (3) Business Days following
ParentÂ’s written request to do so, (iv) take any action to exempt or make any
person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) not subject to the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL or any other potentially applicable anti-takeover or
similar statute or regulation, (v) within three (3) Business Days following
ParentÂ’s written request to do so, fail to publicly recommend against any
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer for Company
Shares within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such offer (and at
all times thereafter during which any such tender offer or exchange offer is
pending) and reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within such ten (10)
Business Day-period (and at all times thereafter during which any such tender
offer or exchange offer is pending), (vi) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, or (vii) resolve, agree or publicly
propose to take any of the foregoing actions (any action described in the
preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) being referred to
herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ "); _provided, however_ ,
that, a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to
and in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed
to be a Company Board Recommendation Change.

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this  _Section 6.2_, the
Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with
respect to the Acquisition Proposal described in the following clause (i) at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time if (i) the Company Board has received a
_bona fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal
that has not been withdrawn, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has breached or violated the provisions of  _Section 6.1_ or
this _Section 6.2_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or any Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (whether or not related to such Acquisition
Proposal), (iii) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering any counter-
offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (v) below), that, in light
of the foregoing Superior Proposal, the failure by the Company Board
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders
under Delaware Law, (iv) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice thereof, which notice shall attach such Superior
Proposal and state expressly the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and all the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal in
reasonable detail and the opportunity to meet with representatives of the
Company Board and its outside legal counsel to discuss a modification of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be effected and (v) Parent shall not have made, within two (2)
Business Days after its receipt of the CompanyÂ’s written notice of its
intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, a counter-offer or
proposal that the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and
its outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable to Company Stockholders
as such Superior Proposal (it being understood and hereby agreed that every
subsequent material revision or material modification to any such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice thereof by the Company to Parent
pursuant to the preceding clause (iv) and a new two (2) Business Day
"matching" period under the preceding clauses (iv) and (v) following the
initial three (3) Business Day "matching" period), and/or (B) following or
concurrent with a Company Board Recommendation Change in accordance with
clause (A), authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement and enter into a
definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Transaction with respect to
a Superior Proposal (if, concurrently with entering into such agreement, the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_). The Company
shall keep confidential any such counter-offers or proposals made by Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment
to this Agreement and to the extent required to be disclosed in any SEC
Reports or applicable Law or stock exchange listing requirement. To the extent
that any "matching" period would expire after the Expiration Time, the
Expiration Time shall be automatically extended such that it will occur on the
first Business Day after the expiration of such "matching" period.

 



44 (d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change at any time prior to the Acceptance Time in response to
an Intervening Event if (i) an Intervening Event has occurred, (ii) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached or violated the
provisions of this _Section 6.2, (iii) _the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that,
in light of such Intervening Event, the failure by the Company Board to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law, (iii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice thereof, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the facts underlying the Company BoardÂ’s determination that an
Intervening Event has occurred and the rationale and basis for such Company
Board Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that any material
change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening
Event shall require a new written notice by the Company to Parent in
compliance with this clause (iii) and a new three (3) Business Day period
under clause (iv) below) and the opportunity to meet with the CompanyÂ’s
outside legal counsel, all with the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and
the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change on the basis of such Intervening Event so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be effected, and (iv) following the
expiration of such three (3)-Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) and
after giving consideration to any offer or proposal from Parent, that, in
light of such Intervening Event, the failure by the Company Board to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders
under Delaware Law.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions
of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit the accurate disclosure of factual information (and such
disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change)
regarding (x) the business, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company or (y) the fact that a Company Acquisition Proposal has been made,
the identity of the party making such proposal or the material terms of such
proposal to the extent, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), (1) the
Company in good faith determines that such information, facts, identity and/or
terms is required to be disclosed under applicable Law and (2) any such
disclosure includes the Company Recommendation without disclosing or
effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done (and to assist and
cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in doing), all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger) as expeditiously as reasonably
practicable in accordance with the terms hereof, including using reasonable
best efforts to (a) subject to _Section 6.4(b)_, cause the conditions to the
Offer set forth in  _Section 1.1(b)_ and the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ to be satisfied or fulfilled as soon as reasonably
practicable, (b) obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and
approvals under any Material Contracts, if and to the extent specifically
requested in writing by Parent, so as to maintain and preserve the benefits
under such Material Contracts following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), (c) subject to
_Section 6.4(b)_, obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities,
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods, making all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) necessary to
consummate the 

 



45  transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), and
(d) execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement.

6.4 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3_, as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the
date hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act and shall file as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) comparable pre-
merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any
foreign Governmental Authority that is required by other applicable Antitrust
Laws, in each case as Parent may reasonably determine. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the
other with any information or documents that may be required in order to
effectuate such filings, and (iii) comply with any request for additional
information made by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control
authorities of any other jurisdiction. Each party hereto shall promptly inform
the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication
from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). If any
party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. Neither Parent nor the Company shall commit or agree (or permit
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to commit or agree) with any
Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior
written consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Parent shall have the right to direct, lead, and make
final decisions regarding strategy relating to the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Laws of any other jurisdiction in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby consistent with its obligations hereunder, subject to
prior good faith consultation with the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any material assets or business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) impose any material restriction, requirement
or limitation on the operation of the business of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in
each of (i) and (ii) if it would be likely to materially and adversely affect
the business of Parent, Company or the Surviving Corporation; provided that,
if requested by Parent, the Company will become subject to, consent to, or
offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
is only binding on the Company in the event the Closing occurs.

6.5 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Without limiting the generality of
the provisions of _Section 6.4_, in the event that any state anti-takeover
or other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Offer and the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company
Board, shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the 

 



46  terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger).

6.6 _Access to Books, Records, Properties and Personnel_. At all times during
the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Acceptance Time, the Company shall afford
Parent and its accountants, legal counsel and other representatives
(including the Financing Parties) reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and
personnel of the Company; _provided, however_ , that no information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive (i) any right or
claim of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any
representation or warranty of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company set
forth herein, or (ii) any condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and
_provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would contravene any law, rule, regulation, Order, judgment,
decree, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or may reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of
any attorney-client or work product privilege. The parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

6.7 _Notification Obligations_.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall give reasonably prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub
(i) upon becoming aware (A) that any representation or warranty made by it in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (B)
of any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in the case of clause (A) or (B) if as a result of
such breach the Offer Conditions or the conditions to the Merger set forth in
_Section 2.2(b)_ would not be satisfied, (ii) upon receiving any written
notice or other written communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) upon
receiving any written notice or other written communication that any Legal
Proceedings have commenced, or to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, threatened, against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, that are related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger; and _provided further_ , that the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.7(a)_.

 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of (i) any
written communication or, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, any express oral
notice, received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any material breach of or
material default by the Company under any Material Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (ii) any written
communication or, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, any express oral notice,
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any third party,
subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
alleging that the

 



47  consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger); _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this  _Section
6.7(b)_ and _provided further_ , that no default of this provision shall occur
unless (A) an officer of the Company or a member of the legal department of
the Company has actual knowledge of such event and the failure to notify
Parent is willful and material, or (B) with respect to matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective
Time, Parent shall give reasonably prompt notice to the Company (i) upon
becoming aware (A) that any representation or warranty made by it or Merger
Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
or (B) of any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) if as
a result of such breach the closing conditions to the Offer and the Merger
would not be satisfied, (ii) upon receiving any written notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) upon receiving
any written notice or other written communication that any Legal Proceedings
have commenced that are related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall apply to any information provided to the Company pursuant to this
_Section 6.7(c)_.

6.8 _Transaction-Related Litigation_.

(a) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any litigation
commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors
by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably and regularly
informed regarding any such litigation.

(b) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any litigation filed against the
Company or any of its directors or officers in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and
the Merger), shall reasonably consider ParentÂ’s views with respect to such
litigation and shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent; which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned. 

6.9 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Vested In-the-Money and Unvested Company Options_. At the Offer Closing,
each outstanding Company Option that is (1) held by a Person who is, as of
immediately prior to the Offer Closing, an employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, in each case, as of immediately before the Offer
Closing, and (2) either (A) vested and exercisable (after giving effect to
any vesting that occurs on account of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) as of immediately before the Offer Closing, with an exercise price
of less than the Offer Price (each a " _Vested Company Option_ ") or (B)
unvested, unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately before the Offer
Closing (each an

 



48  " _Unvested Company Option_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and converted
automatically at the Offer Closing into that number of Parent Options equal to
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Shares subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Offer Closing, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, each with an
exercise price applicable to the Parent Option (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the per share exercise price applicable to the Unvested
Company Option as of immediately before the Offer Closing divided by the
Exchange Ratio; _provided, however_ , that in no case shall the exchange of a
Company Option be performed in a manner that is not in compliance with the
adjustment requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code. The term,
vesting schedule and all of the other provisions applicable to such
assumed Company Options shall remain unchanged, subject only to any
adjustments required for administrative convenience to conform such vesting
schedule to the vesting schedules otherwise specified by ParentÂ’s equity
incentive plans and that are not adverse to the holder thereof.

(b) _All Other Company Options_. Effective as of the Offer Closing, each
Company Option (or portion thereof) that is not assumed by Parent and
converted automatically pursuant to _Section 6.9(a)_ shall, if such Company
Option has a per share exercise price greater than the Offer Price, be
cancelled without the payment of any consideration therefor, or shall, if
such Company Option has a per share exercise price less than the Offer Price,
be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment from Parent as soon as practicable
(but in any event within fifteen (15) days) following the Offer Closing to
the holder thereof equal to the number of shares of Company Shares with
respect to which such option is vested and exercisable as of immediately
before the Offer Closing multiplied by the excess, if any, of (1) Offer
Price, over (2) the per share exercise price for such option. On and after the
Offer Closing all options treated under this _Section 6.9(b)_ shall terminate
and cease to be outstanding.

 

(c) _Company RSUs_. Effective as of the Offer Closing, (i) each Company RSU
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Offer Closing (after
giving effect to any vesting that occurs on account of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and that vests as a function of time and not
performance and (ii) each Company RSU set forth in Section 6.9(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by Parent as a Parent RSU.
Each Company RSU so assumed by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.9(c)_ shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including
vesting terms) set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and the Company
RSU agreements relating thereto, as in effect immediately prior to the Offer
Closing, except that such assumed Company RSU shall cover that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company
Shares underlying such Company RSU immediately prior to the Offer Closing
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Effective as of no later than immediately
preceding the Offer Closing, the Company shall have terminated the Company
ESPP and shall have provided such notice of termination as may be required by
the terms of the Company ESPP. Prior to the Offer Closing and the termination
date of the Company ESPP, (i) the Company shall have determined the date on
which the then-current offering period, if any, shall terminate; and (ii)
accumulated payroll deductions on such date shall be used to purchase the
applicable number of shares of Company Shares.

 

(e) _Implementation_. The Company shall take commercially reasonable actions
reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
6.9_ under the Company Stock Plans, all Company Option agreements, all Company
RSU agreements, the Company ESPP including delivering required notices as
reasonably determined by the Company and/or resolutions of the Company Board
or a committee thereof. Parent shall take all actions necessary to have
available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the assumed Company Options and
assumed Company RSUs.

(f) _Form S-8_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event no more than ten (10) days after the Effective Time), Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 registering
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all
assumed Company Options and settlement of assumed Company RSUs.

 



49 (g) Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k)
plan(s) shall not be terminated, the Company shall terminate any and all
401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates, in each case
effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a
member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section
414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). The Company
shall provide Parent evidence pursuant to resolutions adopted by the
appropriate governing committee that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been terminated. If the 401(k) Plan of the Company is
terminated pursuant hereto as of the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall
permit employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who are employed
as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") to roll over their
account balances (including loan notes) to a 401(k) Plan of Parent or an
Affiliate.

 

(h) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change in accordance with  _Section 6.2_, the Company shall
consult in good faith with Parent, and give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent in respect thereof, prior to
sending any material broad based written communications (including electronic
communications) to the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
regarding this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer or the Merger). In addition, except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, the Company shall not make
any material representations or material commitments to any employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would bind Parent or the Company
following the Closing, solely in their capacity as employees, without the
prior written consent of Parent.

(i) The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) comply with all
applicable provisions of the Transfer Regulations and other similar country-
specific legal standards or applicable Laws in respect of all Continuing
Employees. In furtherance and not in limitation of the preceding sentence,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) comply with all
required obligations under the Transfer Regulations and other similar country-
specific legal standards or applicable Laws, or as otherwise requested by
Parent, to notify and/or consult with the Continuing Employees or the
applicable employee representatives, unions, works councils or other employee
representative bodies, if any, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
such notifications and/or consultations. " _Transfer Regulations_ " means the
Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the
laws of the Member States of the European Union relating to the safeguarding
of employeesÂ’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or
parts of businesses, as amended, and the legislation and regulations of any
Member States of the European Union implementing the foregoing.

 

(j) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) provide the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who remain employed during
such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits (excluding equity based
compensation) which, taken as a whole, have a value substantially comparable,
in the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits provided by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time or (ii) provide or cause
the Surviving Corporation (or, in such case, its successors or assigns) to
provide Covered Employees who remain employed during such period by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries with
compensation and benefits (excluding equity based compensation) which, taken
as a whole, have a value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(k) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including
for purposes of vacation eligibility), but not for purposes of benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
Covered Employees shall receive service credit for service with the Company
(and with any predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which
the Company granted service credit) as if such service had been completed

 



50  with Parent; _provided, however_ , that such service need not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service. 

(l) To the extent applicable, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive any pre-
existing condition limitation on participation and coverage applicable to any
Covered Employee or any of his or her covered dependents under any health or
welfare plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (a " _New Plan_ ") in which such Covered Employee or
covered dependent shall become eligible to participate after the Effective
Time to the extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was no
longer subject to such pre-existing condition limitation under the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee or such
covered dependent was participating immediately before he or she became
eligible to participate in the New Plan. Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary of either to provide each
Covered Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
the Effective Time and during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs under any Employee Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment
and deductible requirements for such calendar year under any New Plan in which
such Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time.

 

(m) This _Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.9_ or
is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of the Employee Plans of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates or limit in any way the right of the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Employee
Plan. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall limit the right of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment
of any Continuing Employee at any time following the Effective Time.

(n) _Required Consents_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (acting
through its Compensation Committee) will take all steps that may be necessary
or advisable to obtain all consents and waivers as may be required from any
award holder to effect this _Section 6.9_ in conformity with all applicable
equity plans.

 

6.10 _Company Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) and all
indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any of their respective current or former directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") in effect on the
date of this Agreement (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") for a period
of six (6) years after the Effective Time. During such period, such
provisions for indemnification shall remain in full force and effect, and
Parent shall not, nor shall it permit the Surviving Corporation to, amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who at any
time on or prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is
required by Law; _provided, however_ , that in the event any claim or claims
are asserted or made either prior to the Effective Time or within such six
(6)-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims.
Any Indemnification Agreements shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation
in the Merger, without any further action, and shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 



51 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the CompanyÂ’s current
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement, on
terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at
its option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to
coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons
than the DandO Insurance, _provided further, however_ , that in satisfying its
obligations under this _Section 6.10(b)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount, the " _Maximum
Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be
as set forth in _Section 6.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule),
_provided_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may
purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") on the DandO
Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the DandO Insurance and for an amount not to exceed two hundred and fifty
percent (250%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year. In the event that the Company does not purchase the Tail
Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the
event that the Company purchases such a Tail Policy prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy
in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 6.10(b)_ for so long as
such Tail Policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.10_.

(d) Except as required by applicable Law, the obligations under this 
_Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party (or any other
person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy
referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives))
without the prior written consent of such affected Company Indemnified Party
or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail
Policy referred to in  _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives). Each of the Company Indemnified Parties or other persons who
are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in
_Section 6.10(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Company Indemnified
Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or
the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this _Section 6.10_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all Indemnification Agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at
law or in equity).

6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
reasonably best efforts to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Company Shares

 



52  (including derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are
treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each director or officer of
the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

 

6.12 _Compensation Committee Approval of New Compensation Arrangements_. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company (acting through its Compensation
Committee) will use reasonable best efforts to take all steps that may be
reasonably necessary to cause each compensation arrangement entered into by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the date of this Agreement
to be approved by the Compensation Committee (comprised solely of
"independent directors" determined within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) as an "employment compensation, severance
or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
promulgated under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

6.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

6.14 _Public Disclosure and Other Communications_. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall consult with each other, and to the extent reasonably
practicable agree, before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange (provided, however, such
consultation shall not be required with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
that complies with Section 6.2(e) of this Agreement), in which case, to the
extent reasonably practicable and as permitted by applicable Law, commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party hereto shall be made prior
to any such release or public statement. The press release announcing this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be jointly
agreed by Parent and the Company.

 

6.15 _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary to consummate the Financing or any Substitute Financing (as defined
below) on the terms, and subject to the conditions (including any "market
flex" provisions) set forth in the Commitment Letter, including using its
commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with and maintain in effect
the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions (including "market
flex" provisions) contained in the Commitment Letter (or with conditions no
less favorable to Parent than the conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letter), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all the conditions to the Financing
and the definitive agreements related thereto (other than any condition as to
which the failure to be so satisfied is a result of the CompanyÂ’s failure to
furnish the Company Financial Information that is Compliant and information
required to be furnished by the Company under _Section 6.15(c))_ and (iv)
comply with ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s obligations under the Commitment Letter
and not take or fail to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay the availability of the Financing on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter. In the event that all conditions to
the Commitment Letter have been satisfied (other than the consummation of the
Offer) or, upon funding shall be satisfied, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Parties to fund at or prior to
the Acceptance Time the Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are
required to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent shall, after obtaining Knowledge thereof, give
the Company written notice of any (A) breach or default by a Financing Party
or any party to the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Financing or (B) withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing
by the Financing Parties. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter,

 



53  including providing copies of all definitive agreements related to the
Financing. In the event that new commitment letters are entered into in
accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
of the Commitment Letter permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.15_, such new
commitment letters shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and deemed
to be the "Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement of the Commitment Letter or any fee
letters. If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable, or it becomes reasonably likely that such
funds may become unavailable to Parent on the terms and conditions set forth
therein, and such funds are reasonably required to consummate the Offer and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (x) notify the
Company in writing thereof, (y) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are not materially
less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub, taken as a whole, than the terms and
conditions as set forth in the Commitment Letter, taking into account any
"market flex" provisions thereof) sufficient to enable Parent to consummate
the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with its terms (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and (z) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter that
provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution thereof,
deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment
letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form reasonably satisfactory
to the Persons providing such Substitute Financing) and related definitive
financing documents with respect to such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining
any commitment for any such Substitute Financing, such financing shall be
deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and any commitment letter for such
Substitute Financing shall be deemed the "Commitment Letter" for all purposes
of this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Commitment Letter or the related fee letters.

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives to,
provide to Parent such cooperation and assistance, as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, which reasonable best efforts shall include:

 

(i) causing its management team, with appropriate seniority and expertise,
including its senior executive officers, and external auditors to assist in
preparation for and to participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies, in each case, upon reasonable notice;

 

(ii) assisting with the syndication or other marketing of the Financing
including, but not limited to, timely preparation of customary rating agency

in connection with the Financing, including the marketing and syndication
thereof, _provided_ , that any such bank information memoranda, prospectuses
and bank syndication materials, offering documents, private placement
memoranda and similar documents shall contain disclosure and pro forma
financial statements reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its
Subsidiaries as the obligor;

 

(iii) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and the Financing Parties, promptly
following ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s request, with all Company Financial
Information, and assisting Parent and Merger Sub with ParentÂ’s and Merger
SubÂ’s preparation of pro forma financial information and projections;

 

(iv) assisting Parent and Merger Sub in obtaining corporate and facilities
ratings in connection with the Financing;

 

(v) reasonably cooperating to permit the prospective lenders involved in the
Financing to evaluate the CompanyÂ’s current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose
of establishing collateral arrangements to the extent

 



54  customary and reasonable for any lending facilities and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the grant of a security interest in collateral and providing
related lender protections (such grant to be subject to and only effective
upon occurrence of the Effective Time);

(vi) furnishing Parent and the Financing Parties promptly, and in any event
at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date (to the extent requested
in writing and with specificity) within 10 Business Days prior to the Closing
Date), with all documentation and other information required by Governmental
Authorities with respect to the Financing under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
PATRIOT Act;

 

(vii) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the earlier
of the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent
to permit the consummation of the Financing; _provided_ that the Company Board
shall not be required to enter into any resolutions or take similar action
approving the Financing;

 

(viii) executing and delivering any customary pledge and security documents,
credit agreements, ancillary loan documents and customary closing
certificates and documents (in each case, subject to and only effective upon
occurrence of the Effective Time) and assisting in preparing schedules thereto
as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub (including delivery of
a solvency certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company);

(ix) providing customary authorization letters authorizing the distribution
of information to prospective lenders and containing a customary
representation to the Financing Parties for the Financing that such
information does not contain a material misstatement or omission and
containing a customary representation (if accurate) to the Financing Parties
that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not include
material non-public information about the Company and its subsidiaries or its
or their securities;

 

(x) causing accountants to consent to the use of their reports in any material
relating to the Financing; and

 

(xi) to the extent reasonably available and as applicable, providing all
financial statements and other data reasonably required to be included
therein, and all other data (including selected financial data) that the SEC
would require in a registered offering or that would be necessary for an
investment bank to receive customary "comfort" (including "negative
assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in connection with a
registered offering by the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
nothing in this Agreement shall require any such cooperation to the extent
that it would (A) require the Company or the Company Representatives, as
applicable, to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses
that are not contingent upon the Effective Time or incur any liability or give
any indemnities that are not contingent upon the Effective Time or (B)
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent
or Merger Sub to, except as specified in _Section 2.2(a)_, consummate the
Offer any earlier than the final day of the Marketing Period. The Company

in connection with the Financing; provided, that such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Affiliates or their reputation or goodwill. All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries obtained by
Parent or its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives and
their respective successors and assigns, pursuant to this _Section 6.15_
