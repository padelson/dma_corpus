vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 31, 2009 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among MERZ GMBH and CO. KGAA, an entity formed under the laws
of the Republic of Germany (" _Parent_ "), VINE ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware
corporation and an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_
"), and BIOFORM MEDICAL, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have
approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
Purchaser has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (such cash tender offer,
as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase
all outstanding shares (the " _Shares_ ") of the Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ "), at a price of $5.45
per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (such price, or
any higher price as may be paid in the Offer in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ ");

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, Purchaser will merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") and each Share that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (1) Shares held in the treasury of
the Company or owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time for which no consideration will be paid and (2) Dissenting
Shares) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price, all upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (1)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (2) adopted and approved this
Agreement and (3) determined to recommend that the stockholders of the Company
accept the Offer and tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer
and, to the extent required to consummate the Merger, adopt this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Purchaser has, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Purchaser,
has adopted this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company
are executing and delivering tender and support agreements in favor of Parent
and Purchaser (the " _Support Agreements"_ ). NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_. (a) (i) _Provided_ that this Agreement has not been
terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VIII hereto, Purchaser will, and Parent
will cause Purchaser to, promptly (but in no event later than the tenth
(10th) Business Day after (but not including) the date of this Agreement)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase all
Shares at the Offer Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not
be required to commence the Offer (and the ten (10) Business Day period
referred to above shall be accordingly extended) if (i) the Company shall not
have provided to Parent on a timely basis all information reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the preparation of the Offer Documents or the
Company shall not have reviewed and provided comments to Parent on the
Offer Documents on a timely basis, or (ii) the Company is not prepared to,
concurrently with such commencement, file with the SEC and disseminate to
holders of Shares the Schedule 14D-9. The obligations of Purchaser (and of
Parent to cause Purchaser) to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer will be subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions set forth in ANNEX I (the " _Offer Conditions_ ").
The initial expiration date of the Offer will be the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following (and including the day of) the commencement of the
Offer. Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but will not be obligated) at
any time or from time to time in its sole discretion to waive any Offer
Condition or modify or amend the terms of the Offer, except that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser will not (1) decrease the
Offer Price or change the form of the consideration payable in the Offer, (2)
decrease the number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer, (3) amend or waive
the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in _ANNEX I_ ), (4) add to the
conditions set forth on _ANNEX I_ , (5) modify the conditions set forth on
_ANNEX I_ in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (6) extend the
expiration date of the Offer except as required or permitted by Section
1.1(a)(iii) or (7) make any other change in the terms or conditions of
the Offer that is materially adverse to the holders of Shares.

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
satisfaction or (if legally permissible) waiver by Purchaser of the Offer
Conditions as of the time of any scheduled expiration of the Offer, Purchaser
will, and Parent will cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
after such scheduled expiration, and Purchaser will, and Parent will cause
Purchaser to, immediately accept and promptly pay for all Shares as they are
validly tendered during any "subsequent offer period" pursuant to Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act.



 

2 (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
but subject to the parties respective termination rights under _ARTICLE
VIII_ : (A)(1) if, as of the time of any scheduled expiration of the Offer,
any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, Purchaser may,
in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other
Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period
of up to twenty (20) Business Days per extension, to permit such Offer
Condition to be satisfied; (2) Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without
the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer from time to
time for any period required by any rule, regulation; interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer;
and (3) Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the
Company or any other Person), elect to provide for a "subsequent offering
period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act (unless immediately following the Purchase Time,
Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries beneficially own ninety
percent (90%) or more of the Shares outstanding at that time (which Shares
beneficially owned will include Shares tendered in the Offer and not
withdrawn)); and (B) (1) if requested by the Company, Purchaser will extend
the Offer for one or more periods of time of up to twenty (20) Business Days
per extension, if at any scheduled expiration of the Offer any of the Offer
Conditions are not satisfied or waived; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any scheduled expiration of the Offer,
the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied or waived, and, prior to
such scheduled expiration, an Acquisition Proposal has been disclosed,
announced, commenced, submitted or made and not withdrawn, then Purchaser
shall not be required to extend the Offer pursuant to this clause "(B)(1)"
for more than (20) Business Days in the aggregate; (2) Purchaser will extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the
staff thereof or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _Nasdaq_ ) applicable to the
Offer; and (3) if immediately following the Purchase Time, Parent, Purchaser
and their respective Subsidiaries beneficially own more than eighty percent
(80%) but less than ninety percent (90%) of the Shares outstanding at that
time (which Shares beneficially owned will include Shares tendered in the
Offer and not withdrawn), if requested by the Company or determined by
Purchaser to be desirable, Purchaser will provide for a subsequent offering
period for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of
at least ten (10) Business Days; _provided_ , that in no circumstance will
Parent and Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser will file
or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(collectively with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_
") with respect to the Offer that will contain the offer to purchase and
forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other
ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be
made (collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ ") and will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The
Company and its counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC. Parent and
Purchaser agree (1) to provide the Company with, and to consult with the
Company regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and
prior to responding 



 

3  thereto and (2) to provide the Company with any comments or responses
thereto. Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that it has become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
shall promptly furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys stockholders that may be
required or reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any action
contemplated by this Section 1.1(b).

(c) Parent will provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis
the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any
particular Share is accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer,
the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a record date with
respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the Offer Price
shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 1.2 _Company Consent; Schedule 14D-9_. On the date the Offer Documents
are filed, the Company will file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (which shall include all of the information
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder) (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing, subject to Sections 6.3(d) and 6.3(e), the
recommendations of the Company Board described in Section 4.4(b), and
complying in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion of the recommendations of the Company Board
described in Section 4.4(b) in the Offer Documents and to the inclusion of a
copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to
the Companys stockholders. Except with respect to any amendments filed in
connection with a Change of Board Recommendation made in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser and their counsel will be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to its filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to (1) provide Parent and
Purchaser with, and to consult with Parent and Purchaser regarding, any
comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly upon receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto,
and (2) provide Parent and Purchaser with any comments or responses thereto.
The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
be disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to 



 

4  the extent that it has become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent shall promptly
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent, Purchaser and the
Offer that may be required or reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2.

Section 1.3 _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company
will cause its transfer agent to, promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof), furnish Parent and Purchaser with
mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner
listings, and readily available computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the latest practicable
date and will furnish Parent and Purchaser with such information and
assistance (including periodic updates of such information) as Parent or
Purchaser or their agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial holders of the Shares. Subject to the requirements
of applicable Law, and except for such actions as are reasonably necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and otherwise to perform its obligations
hereunder, from the date hereof until the Purchase Time, each of Parent and
Purchaser will hold all information and documents provided to it under this
Section 1.3 in confidence in accordance with the Mutual Nondisclosure
Agreement by and between Parent and the Company dated October 20, 2009 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and will use such information and documents
only in connection with the Offer, and if this Agreement will have been
terminated by Parent or Purchaser, will deliver to the Company all such
information and documents (and all copies thereof).

Section 1.4 _Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser pursuant
to the Offer of such number of Shares as satisfy at least the Minimum Tender
Condition, and from time to time thereafter, Parent will be entitled to
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board as will give Parent representation on the Company Board
equal to the product of (x) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(after giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to
this Section 1.4(a)) and (y) the percentage that such number of Shares so
purchased bears to the total number of then-outstanding Shares ( _provided_
_that_ , in no event shall Parents director designees constitute less than a
majority of the entire Company Board), and the Company will, upon request by
Parent, promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek the resignations of such number of directors as is
necessary to provide Parent with such level of representation and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Parents designees to be so elected
or appointed. Subject to the applicable requirements of Nasdaq (including
Stock Market Rule 5615(c)), the Company will also, upon request by Parent,
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause individuals designated by
Parent to constitute the same percentage of each committee of the Company
Board and each board of directors (and committee thereof) of each Subsidiary
of the Company as the percentage of the entire Company Board represented by
individuals designated by Parent, and (ii) obtain and deliver to Parent the
resignation of each individual who is an officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (as such, but not as an employee). In connection with the
performance of its obligations to cause Parents designees to 



 

5  be elected or appointed to the Company Board, the Company shall promptly
take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information
with respect to the Company and its officers, directors and designees, as
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder,
require; _provided_ _that_ Parent and Purchaser will have timely supplied to
the Company all information with respect to themselves and their respective
executive officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Parent and Purchaser will
be solely responsible for such information so provided. The provisions of
this Section 1.4 are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates may have (with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Law as a holder or
beneficial owner of Shares.

(b) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant to
Section 1.4(a) and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or termination
of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, any extension of time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Purchaser under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions under this Agreement that are for the benefit of the
Company, and any action to seek to enforce any obligation of Parent or
Purchaser under this Agreement (or any other action by the Company Board with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger if such other action
adversely affects, or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect, in
each case in any material respect, any of the holders of Shares other than
Parent or Purchaser) may only be authorized by, and will require the
authorization of, a majority of the directors of the Company then in office
who are directors of the Company on the date hereof or their successors as
appointed by such continuing directors (the " _Continuing Directors_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if there will be no Continuing Directors as a
result of such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusal to
serve, then such actions may be effected by majority vote of the Independent
Directors, or, if no Independent Directors are then in office, by a majority
vote of the Company Board. The parties will use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that at least two (2) of the members of the Company Board
will, at all times prior to the Effective Time, be Continuing Directors.

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to Section 1.4(a), until the Effective Time, (1) the
Company Board will have at least such number of directors as may be required
by the Nasdaq rules (taking into account Stock Market Rule 5615(c)) or the
federal securities Laws who are considered independent directors within the
meaning of such rules and Laws (" _Independent Directors_ ") and (2) each
committee of the Company Board that is required (or a majority of which is
required) by the Nasdaq rules (taking into account Stock Market Rule 5615(c))
or the federal securities Laws to be composed solely of Independent Directors
will be so composed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if the number of Independent
Directors is reduced below the number of directors as may be required by such
rules or Laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s)
will be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who will be
deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
Independent Director then remains, the other directors will designate such
number of directors as may be required by the Nasdaq rules (taking
into account Stock Market Rule 5615(c)) and the federal securities Laws, to
fill such vacancies who will not be stockholders or Affiliates of Parent or
Purchaser, and such Persons will be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement. 



 

6 Section 1.5 _Top-Up Option_. (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants
to Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable in Purchasers
discretion, but only after the acceptance by Purchaser of, and payment for,
Shares tendered in the Offer, to purchase (for cash or a note payable)
that number (but not less than that number) of Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_
") as is equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number
of Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser at the time of such exercise, will
constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the total Shares then
outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares) at a price per Share
equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the Top-Up Option
will be exercisable only once, at such time as Parent and Purchaser, directly
or indirectly, own at least eighty (80%) of the total Shares then outstanding,
and only on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after the expiration date
of the Offer or the expiration date of any subsequent offering period, (2) in
no event will the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in
excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued Shares (including as
authorized and unissued Shares, for purposes of this Section 1.5(a), any
Shares held in the treasury of the Company), and (3) the Top-Up Option may not
be exercised if any provision of applicable Law (including the Nasdaq rules)
or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity will
prohibit, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or
the Companys stockholders in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise, which
action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or
notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable.
Purchaser will, concurrently with the exercise of the Top-Up Option, give
written notice to the Company that as promptly as practicable following such
exercise, Purchaser intends to (and Purchaser will, and Parent will cause
Purchaser to, as promptly as practicable after such exercise) consummate the
Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section
2.7.

(b) The aggregate purchase price payable for the Shares purchased by Purchaser
pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of
such Shares by the Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Purchaser,
at its election, either entirely in cash or by executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to such purchase
price, or by any combination of the foregoing. Any such promissory note shall
bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and
may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

(c) In the event that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent
or Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth: (i) the
number of Shares that Purchaser intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up
Option; (ii) the manner in which Parent or Purchaser intends to pay the
applicable exercise price; and (iii) the place and time at which the closing
of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by Purchaser is to take place. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify
Parent and Purchaser of the number of Shares then outstanding, the number of
Shares then outstanding on a fully diluted 



 

7  basis and the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of
such Top-Up Shares, Parent or Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange therefor, and
the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate representing
such Top-Up Shares. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any
legends required by applicable securities laws. 

(d) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Shares that Purchaser may acquire
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the
Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder
for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser
represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, and will be upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees
that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise
thereof are being and will be acquired for the purpose of investment and not
with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act.

ARTICLE II

Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of

existence of Purchaser will cease and the Company will continue as the

conditions at the Closing), or at such other place or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree. At the Closing, the parties hereto
will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger
complying with Section 251 of the DGCL or a certificate of ownership and
merger complying with Section 253 of the DGCL (each, a " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the parties
hereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ") and
will make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in
connection with the Merger.

Section 2.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of

debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser will become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 



 

8 Section 2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. (a) At the
Effective Time, unless otherwise determined by Parent prior thereto, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company will, by virtue of the Merger, be
amended and restated in its entirety to (subject to Section 6.5(a)) conform to
the certificate of incorporation of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Company shall be determined
by Parent and, as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms
and as provided by applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, unless otherwise determined by Parent prior
thereto, the bylaws of the Company will be amended and restated in their
entirety to (subject to Section 6.5(a)) conform to the bylaws of Purchaser as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, as so amended, will
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with their terms, in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.5 _Directors and Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, in
each case until the earlier of his or her resignation or removal or until his
or her successor is duly elected and qualified.

Section 2.6 _Special Meeting_. Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance
with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 2.7, and except as
permitted by Regulation 14C of the SEC and the Companys organizational
documents, and subject to applicable Law, the Company, acting through
its Board of Directors, will, in accordance with applicable Law, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting (the " _Special Meeting_ ")
of its stockholders promptly following the Purchase Time for the purpose of
adopting this Agreement and include in the Information Statement the Company
Board Recommendation. Parent and Purchaser each agree that, at the Special
Meeting, all of the Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer or otherwise owned
by Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries will be voted in
favor of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement.

Section 2.7  _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. If, following the
Offer and any subsequent offering period or the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
Parent and Purchaser (together with any other direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent), will hold in the aggregate at least ninety percent
(90%) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company
that would otherwise be entitled to vote on the adoption of this Agreement,
each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company will (subject to Section 7.1) take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective,
promptly after the consummation of the Offer, without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.



 

9 ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS 

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities, the following will occur:

(a) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares described in Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares)
will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon
surrender of certificates formerly representing such Shares in the manner
provided in Section 3.4;

(b) each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and each Share
owned by Parent, Purchaser or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and retired
without any conversion thereof, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange thereof; and

(c) each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, the Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a record date with
respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 3.2 _Treatment of Equity Awards_. Prior to the Purchase Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any
Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take all other actions
so that as of the Purchase Time, and without any consent on the part of the
holder of any shares of Common Stock or any award under any Company
Stock Plans and without any consent on the part of any other Person:

(a) each Company Stock Option that is vested and outstanding immediately
prior to the Purchase Time shall be converted solely into the right to receive
the consideration set forth in this Section 3.2(a), with the holder of each
such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive a payment in cash,
in consideration of such conversion and in full settlement in respect of such
Company Stock Option, in an amount equal to the product of: (A) the difference
of: (1) the Merger Consideration; minus (2) the exercise price per share
of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; multiplied by (B) the
total number of shares of Common Stock subject to the unexercised portion of
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to such time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the exercise price per share of Common Stock under any
such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, then such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled for no
consideration; and



 

10 (b) each Company Stock Option that is unvested and outstanding immediately
prior to the Purchase Time shall entitle the holder thereof solely the right
to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 3.2(b), with the holder
of each such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive upon the
vesting thereof in accordance with the terms of such Company Stock Option and
the applicable Company Stock Plan pursuant to which it was issued (as
modified, in each case, pursuant to this Agreement), in full settlement in
respect of such Company Stock Option, a payment in cash in an amount equal to
the product of: (A) the difference of: (1) the Merger Consideration; minus (2)
the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option; multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject
to the unexercised portion of such Company Stock Option that would have become
so vested and exercisable at such time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
exercise price per share of Common Stock under any such Company Stock Option
is equal or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Stock
Option shall be cancelled for no consideration.

All amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.2(a) shall be paid as promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than thirty (30) days) following the
Purchase Time, without interest. All amounts payable pursuant to Section
3.2(b) shall be paid as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later
than thirty (30) days) following the date such Company Stock Option becomes
vested, without interest. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
make such payments in accordance with the foregoing.

Prior to the Purchase Time, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall agree
either on: (i) the terms of an arrangement pursuant to which the Company (or,
at Parents option, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent) deposits (in trust for
Persons who might be entitled to payments pursuant to Section 3.2(b)) into a
separate bank account at a bank designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company an amount of cash equal to the amount that might
become payable pursuant to Section 3.2(b); or (ii) an arrangement, which might
include a letter of credit or other arrangement providing appropriate
security for the payments due under Section 3.2(b), reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent, that would cause such Persons to hold "property" (for
purposes of Section 83 of the Code) with respect to the amounts that might
become payable pursuant to Section 3.2(b) or that otherwise would be
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent; provided that if an
arrangement contemplated by the foregoing clause (ii) cannot be mutually
agreed, the parties shall be required to establish an arrangement consistent
with clause (i) of this sentence.

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders of Shares that have
properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and the holders thereof will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
fails to perfect or effectively waives, withdraws or loses such 



 

11  holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders Shares will not
constitute Dissenting Shares and instead will thereupon be deemed
automatically to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into, and
represent only, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in
Section 3.1 of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

(b) The Company will give Parent (1) reasonably prompt notice of any appraisal
demands received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the
Company, and (2) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any payment with
respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle
any such rights.

 

Section 3.4 _Surrender of Shares_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time and from
time to time after the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds to timely
make, and will cause the Paying Agent to timely make, all payments pursuant
to Section 3.4(b). Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent; provided, that such investments will be in short-term obligations
of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30)
days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the
Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (collectively, the "
_Certificates_ "), a form of letter of transmittal (which will be in
customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company and will specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate, and such Certificate will then be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it will be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment will have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or will have established to 



 

12  the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4(b), each
Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article III.

(c) At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time, Parent will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that have been
made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to holders
of Certificates and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates. The Surviving
Corporation will pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder or former
holder of shares of Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any
cash amounts delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law.

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed and thereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of
Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time, and holders of
Certificates that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company. After the
Effective Time, Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer will be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article III.

(e) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the holders delivery to the Paying Agent of an affidavit of loss and a bond
(in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, as Parent may request,
the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this ARTICLE III. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.4.

(f) If any Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of: (i) the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective; or
(ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the cash amount that such
Certificate represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, then such cash amount shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

Section 3.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and
withheld) from the consideration otherwise 



 

13  payable pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement (including, with respect to the treatment of equity awards, Section
3.2) any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that any such
amounts are properly withheld and are paid to the appropriate Governmental
Entity in accordance with applicable Law, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares or other Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Purchaser and Parent acknowledge and agree that no
amounts are required to be deducted or withheld under German Law from
consideration payable pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise pursuant
to this Agreement to holders of Shares.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the SEC Reports filed with the SEC on or after
September 25, 2009 and publicly available on EDGAR (excluding any disclosures

document that are general cautionary, predictive or forward-looking
in nature) or in the correspondingly numbered section of the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Purchaser concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that a matter disclosed with respect to one
representation or warranty will also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to
each other representation or warranty to which the matter disclosed reasonably
relates, but only to the extent such relationship is reasonably apparent on
the face of the disclosure contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule with
respect to such matter), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Purchaser as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. (a) Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a duly organized and validly existing
corporation or other entity in good standing (where applicable) under the Laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all corporate or
other entity power and authority to own its properties and conduct
its business as currently conducted and is duly qualified and in good
standing as a foreign corporation or entity authorized to do business in each
of the jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held
under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
" _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, effect, event or occurrence
that has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, condition (financial
or otherwise), operations or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Company to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any changes, effects, events
or occurrences will not be deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect to
the extent resulting from (1) general changes or conditions in general
economic or market conditions or in the industries (or therapeutic areas) in
which the Company operates, so long as such changes or conditions do not
have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared with other companies 



 

14  operating in the industries (or therapeutic areas) in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries operate; (2) the loss or departure of directors, officers,
employees, or other service providers of the Company, or the termination,
reduction (or potential reduction) or any other adverse development (or
potential adverse development) in the Companys relationships with any of its
customers, suppliers, distributors or other business partners, in each case
as a direct result of the announcement or pendency of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; (3) a decrease in the market price of the

applicable Law. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them

Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act)), where the result, purpose
or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

the SEC Reports.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any accrued,

accounting, legal and other fees and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, or
(5) liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The "
_Audited Balance Sheet_ " means the consolidated balance sheet of the Company
dated as of June 30, 2009 included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the twelve (12)-month period ended June 30, 2009 filed with the SEC on
September 25, 2009.

(f) The inventory of the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected on the most
recent balance sheet included in the SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to
the date hereof was, and the current inventory (the " _Inventory_ ") of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is, in usable and saleable condition in the
ordinary course of business. The Inventory is not excessive and is adequate
in all material respects in relation to the current trading requirements of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (other than as may be
covered by an adequate reserve recorded in the Companys Financial Statements)
none of the Inventory is, to any material extent, obsolete, unmarketable or
inappropriate or of limited value in relation to the current business of the

been operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code, its
Treasury regulations, and any applicable administrative guidance relating
thereto.

(h) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with another
event, whether contingent or otherwise) could: (i) result in any bonus,
severance or other payment or obligation to any Employee (whether or not

the Company, the fair market value of the 



 

37  assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any
Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient in all
material respects to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations
with respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan.
Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall cause any the assets or

before any Governmental Entity.

in or triggered notice requirements or liability under the WARN Act or any

Condition is not satisfied; or (II) (1) any director who ceases to support
the Offer or the Merger also voices opposition to the Offer and the Merger and
such opposition is disclosed publicly or to any stockholder of the Company
that is not also a director or officer of the Company and (2) such opposition
is reasonably expected to adversely effect the likelihood of consummation of
the Offer or the Merger) or (B) recommend the approval or adoption of, or
accept, approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, accept, approve
or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve, agree or publicly propose to
take any of the actions contemplated by clauses "(A)" or "(B)" (any action

contemplated pursuant to Section 6.3(b), approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its

memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement (A)
constituting or relating to, or that contemplates or is intended or is
reasonably likely to result in, an Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring the
Company (whether or not subject to conditions) to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Offer or the Merger (any of "(A)" and "(B)", an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "). The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Persons

Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to any such Person. The Company
agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to amend
or waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Company
or its Subsidiaries is or becomes a party or under which any of the Company
or its Subsidiaries has or acquires any rights (unless the Company Board
determines in good faith, 



 

50  after having taken into account the advice of the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law),
and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced
each such agreement at the request of Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.3(a), if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Purchase
Time, (1) the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from a third
party that has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board believes in good
faith is bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.3, (3) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after having taken into account the advice of an independent financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and the Companys outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to
or result in a Superior Proposal, (4) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after having taken into account the advice of the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take any of the actions described
in clauses "(A)" and/or "(B)" below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, and (5) the
Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and of the Companys intention to take such actions; then
the Company may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) participate in and facilitate
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal and assist and otherwise
cooperate with such Person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not, and will not allow its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to take any of the actions
described in clause "(A)" above unless the Company (x) has, or first enters
into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person containing customary
limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written and oral
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company and
customary "standstill" provisions, and containing other provisions no less
favorable to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, (y)
prior to or concurrently with furnishing any non-public information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Person, the Company provides to Parent
any such non-public information, to the extent such information was not
previously provided or Made Available by the Company to Parent.

(c) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Purchase Time, the
Company will promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) notify
Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
receives any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that is
reasonably likely to result in an Acquisition Proposal (including the identity
of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer
and the material terms and conditions thereof). The Company will
provide Parent promptly (and in any event within such forty-eight (48) hour
period) a copy of any written documentation relating to such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer, including any modifications thereto.
The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of the
status of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (and in
any event no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the occurrence of any
material changes or developments in any such 



 

51  Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer, including furnishing to
Parent copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will promptly
(and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section
6.3(b). The Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that would restrict the Companys ability to comply with this Section 6.3(c).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.3(a) to the contrary, if (1) the
Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that
has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board believes in good faith is
bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.3, (3) the Company Board determines in good faith, after having
taken into account the advice of an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and the Companys outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (4) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of
the Companys outside legal counsel, that in light of such Superior Proposal,
a failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law, (5) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company
Board shall have given Parent at least three (3) Business Days written
notice (or such correspondingly lesser period of notice if less than three
(3) Business Days remains before the then-scheduled expiration date of the
Offer): (A) that it has received a Superior Proposal not in violation of the
provisions of this Section 6.3; (B) that it intends to make a Change of Board
Recommendation; and (C) specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Person making such offer (and
attaching the most current and complete version of any written agreement or
other document relating thereto) (it being understood and agreed that any
change to the consideration payable in connection with such Superior Proposal
or any other material modification thereto relating to conditions to closing,
termination rights or provisions similar to those contained in this Section
6.3 and in Section 8.5(c) shall require a new three (3) Business Days advance
written notice by the Company (or such correspondingly lesser period of
notice if less than three (3) Business Days remains before the then-scheduled
expiration date of the Offer)); (6) during any such notice period(s), if
requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement and (7) at the end of any such notice period,
the failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation would still be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law (taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations
required by clause "(6)" or otherwise), then, the Company Board may at any
time prior to the Purchase Time effect a Change of Board Recommendation and/or
cause the Company to (x) terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.3(b), and (y) concurrently with such termination enter into a
binding, written definitive Acquisition Agreement providing for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Superior Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.3(a) to the contrary, other than
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may effect a Change
of Board 



 

52  Recommendation at any time prior to the Purchase Time, if it determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that due to any event,
development or change in circumstances that occurs, arises, or becomes known
to the Company Board following the date of this Agreement, the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; provided that, prior to
effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, (1) the Company must provide to
Parent three (3) Business Days prior written notice (or such correspondingly
lesser period of notice if less than three (3) Business Days remains before
the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer) of the Company Boards
intention to effect such Change of Board Recommendation in light of such
event, development or change in circumstances, (2) during such notice
period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that failure
to effect such Change of Board Recommendation is no longer inconsistent with
the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law in light of such event, development or change in
circumstances, and (3) at the end of such notice period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to make such a Change of Board Recommendation would still be
inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law in light of such
event, development or change in circumstances (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the
negotiations required by clause "(2)" or otherwise).

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 will prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such disclosure does not
concurrently and expressly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation or if it
has the effect of withdrawing, or of qualifying or modifying in a manner
adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation, then such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation for all
purposes of this Agreement. 

(g) The Company will not take any action to (1) exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar
provision of any other Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply,
or (2) exempt any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates) from the provisions on "control share acquisitions" contained in
any Takeover Law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, in each
case unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b).

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest in making an offer or
proposal (other than an offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest
made by Parent or any of its Affiliates), made or renewed by a Person or
"group" (as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder) of Persons
at any time after the date hereof contemplating or structured to permit (A)
any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business
combination, joint venture, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities,
recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar 



 

53  transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of
related transactions, in each case other than the transactions contemplated
hereby: (1) in which a Person or "group" (as defined above) of Persons
directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of securities
representing 15% or more of the outstanding securities of any class of voting
securities (or instruments convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for 15% or more of any such class) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent
of the Company or such Subsidiary or surviving entity or (2) in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries issues securities representing 15% or more
of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of the Company
or such Subsidiary (or instruments convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for 15% or more of any such class); (B) any sale, lease,
exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of any business or
businesses or assets that constitute or account for 15% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that, if consummated, would result in a
Person or "group" (as defined above) owning, directly or indirectly: (A) 50%
or more of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities (or
instruments convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for 50% or more
of such class) of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity;
or (B) 50% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, in each of clause "(A)" and "(B)", which the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after taking into account the advice of
an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the
Companys outside legal counsel is more favorable to the Companys
stockholders than the terms of the Offer and the Merger, taking into account
all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal
(including whether it is subject to any financing condition and the likelihood
the transaction will be consummated on the terms proposed) and the Person
making the proposal (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise,
and any fees payable by the Company hereunder).

Section 6.4 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) From the Control
Time until December 31, 2010, Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including each
executive officer, with base wages and a short-term cash bonus opportunity no
less favorable than those in effect as of the Control Time and with employee
benefits (excluding equity compensation) no less favorable than those in
effect as of the Control Time, including with respect to retirement, health
and welfare and severance plans. Parent acknowledges that the Company has
terminated its 2009 annual cash bonus plan and suspended matching
contributions under its Section 401(k) plan. In 2010, Parent intends, and
shall, in 2010 reinstitute an annual cash bonus plan and a matching
contribution under the Companys 401(k) plan.

(b) If after the Control Time, employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
become participants in benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries, Parent
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide service credit with the
Company for all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods for participation and coverage requirements under 



 

54  any welfare plan, to the extent that such employee would receive service
credit for such conditions under the corresponding welfare plan in which any
such employee participated immediately prior to the Control Time, (ii)
provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, and (iii) provide service
credit with the Company for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
accruals (except benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan) under any
employee benefit plan of the Parent or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall any such employee be entitled to any
credit under subsections (i), (ii), and (iii) of this Section 6.4(b) to the
extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits.

(c) If requested by Parent in writing at least (i) twenty (20) days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit
Plans (other than any such plan intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of
the Code), or (ii) five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall terminate any Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of the Code, in each such case, effective not later than the last
Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time or such later time as
required by the terms of such Company Benefit Plans or the contracts between
the Company and any third party administrators of such Company Benefit Plans
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, unless amended in accordance with
the terms of such plans or contracts at Parents reasonable request.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement to the contrary, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does (1) prohibit the Company,
its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its or their
Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan, (2) require
the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation or its or
their Affiliates to keep any person employed for any period of time, or (3)
constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any Company
Benefit Plan; and no current or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries participating in any such Company Benefit Plan shall have
any claim or cause of action, under ERISA or otherwise, in respect of any
provisions of this Agreement.

Section 6.5  _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
The certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and director exculpation that are at least as favorable as those set
forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company as in
effect at the date hereof (to the extent consistent with applicable Law),
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period ending six (6) years after the Effective Time (and in the event that
any Proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim is made during such period,
until the final disposition of such Proceeding or claim) in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the persons who at any time
prior to the Effective Time were entitled to indemnification, advancement of
expenses or exculpation under the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws
of the Company in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, in which case
Parent agrees, and will cause the Surviving Corporation, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to make such changes to the certificate of incorporation
and the bylaws as to have the least adverse affect on the rights of the
individuals referenced in this Section 6.5.



 

55 (b) From and after the Effective Time and until the earlier of six (6) years
after the Effective Time and the expiration of any applicable statutes of
limitation, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an _"Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and fees,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements),
liabilities or amounts in connection with any claim, action, suit, Proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
including all appeals thereof to which any Indemnified Party is or may become
a party to by virtue of his or her service as a present or former director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and arising out of actual
or alleged events, actions or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred
at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted and provided in the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation and as permitted under the DGCL. Each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses in connection
therewith (provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced shall have
provided an undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, (1) subject to Parents prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld), the Company shall obtain "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope
no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company for claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time at a cost
that is reasonable and customary for tail insurance policies with its existing
directors and officers liability policy insurer or an insurer with a
comparable insurer financial strength rating as the Companys existing
directors and officers liability policy insurer; or (2) if Parent shall not
have so consented or the Company shall not have obtained such tail policy,
the Surviving Corporation will provide for a period of not less than six (6)
years after the Effective Time to the directors and officers who are insured
under the Companys directors and officers insurance policy an insurance
policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is not less favorable than
the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, the best reasonably
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of $590,000; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that if the annual
premium of such coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage reasonably available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Parent
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such policies referred
to in Section 6.5(c) to be maintained in full force and effect for their full
terms, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) The obligations under this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or modified
after the Control Time in such a manner as to affect adversely any Indemnified
Party to whom this Section 6.5 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 6.5 applies shall be express third-party 



 

56  beneficiaries of this Section 6.5). This Section 6.5 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties referred to herein.

(e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (1)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (2) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. The
agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive
of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether
pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 6.5 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies.

Section 6.6 _Further Action; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, each party will use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing in this
Section 6.6 will require Parent or Purchaser to keep the Offer open beyond
the expiration date set forth in the Offer (as it may be extended from time to
time). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, to the extent
required under the HSR Act, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof), to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
promptly, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period
provided for in the HSR Act.

(b) Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, will, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.6(a)
to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, use its reasonable best
efforts to (1) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (2) keep
the other party reasonably informed of any material communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the
" _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_
") or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each 



 

57  case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(3) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the
FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 6.6(a) and 6.6(b), if any objections are asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act
or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity challenging any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of law or that would
otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections
or suits that, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company will take all such further action as may be
necessary to resolve such objections and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the Outside Date), including, without limitation (1)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (2) otherwise taking or committing to
take any actions that after the Closing would limit the freedom of Parent or
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
its or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or
Affiliates businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing,
materially delaying the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside
Date; provided that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will
become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with
respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a
Governmental Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Company only in the event
that the Closing occurs.

(d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company will cooperate in all
respects with each other and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any 



 

58  decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Prior to the Purchase Time, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any Consents, approvals or waivers of third
parties with respect to any Contracts to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party as may be necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or required by the terms of any
Contract as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event
will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to
the Effective Time any material fee, penalty or other material consideration
to any third party to obtain any consent, approval or waiver required with
respect to any such Contract.

Section 6.7 _Takeover Laws_. The Company will (a) take all reasonable steps to
exclude the applicability to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or the Support Agreements of any Takeover Laws,
and (b) assist in any challenge by Parent or Purchaser to the validity, or the
applicability to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement or the Support Agreements, of any Takeover Laws.

Section 6.8 _Information Statement_. Unless the Merger is consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 2.7,
promptly after the consummation of the Offer, the Company will prepare and
file with the SEC the Information Statement in preliminary form as required
by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
which will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Parent and
Purchaser and their counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Information Statement prior to its filing with the SEC. The
Company will obtain and furnish the information required to be included in
the Information Statement, will provide Parent and Purchaser with, and consult
with Parent and Purchaser regarding, any comments that may be received from
the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, will provide Parent and Purchaser
with any comments or responses thereto, and will cause the Information
Statement in definitive form, which will comply in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, to be mailed to the Companys stockholders. The Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Information Statement if
and to the extent that it has become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by Law. The Company further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Information Statement as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of the Companys
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws.

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be issued by any party without the
prior consent of the Company and Parent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or 



 

59  announcement may be required by applicable Law or any rule or regulation of
Nasdaq or any other stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject or
submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement will use commercially reasonable efforts to allow each
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance. The restrictions of this Section 6.9 will not apply
to communications by the Company regarding a Change of Board Recommendation
made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 6.10 _Notification_. (a) The Company will give reasonably prompt

event that is reasonably likely to result in the failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any Offer Condition.

notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) any Proceeding commenced or (to its
Knowledge) threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting, the Company or its Subsidiaries that relates to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No notification given to
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.10(b) shall limit or otherwise affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company
contained in this Agreement or any of the remedies available to Parent
hereunder.

Section 6.11 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement will give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Control Time. Prior to the Control Time, the Company will exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 6.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or compromise of any
litigation by or on behalf of one or more stockholders (or former
stockholders) of the Company against the Company and/or its directors or
officers commenced prior to the Effective Time and concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement or compromise shall be
agreed to without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Section 6.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Purchase Time and the
Effective Time, if and as applicable, the Company shall take such reasonable
steps as are required to cause the disposition of Common Stock and Company
Stock Options in connection with the Offer and the Merger, if and as

to the Company, to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant
to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

resignation of each officer and director (as such, but not as an employee) of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.



 

60 Section 6.15 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Purchase Time, the
Company (acting through its compensation committee of independent directors)
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule
14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement entered into prior to, on or
after the date hereof by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates with current or future directors, officers or employees of the
Company and its Affiliates and to ensure that any such arrangements fall
within the safe harbor provisions of such rule. The Company shall give Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any board of
director or compensation committee resolutions proposed to be adopted by the
Company pursuant to this Section 6.15 prior to adoption thereof.

Section 6.16 _Delisting_. From the Purchase Time to the Closing Date, the

deliver to Parent a certificate substantially in the form provided for in
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h), certifying that
the Shares do not constitute "United States real property interests" within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(1) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
If no such certificate is delivered, Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold (or to cause to be deducted and withheld)
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts, if any, as are required to
be withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code and the regulations
thereunder and shall timely pay (or cause to be paid) any such withheld
amounts to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the remedy set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be the sole remedy available to Parent and Purchaser in the
event that the Company fails to deliver the certificate described in this
Section 6.17.

Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b), the fee referred to in 



 

64  the preceding sentence shall be paid by the Company within two (2) Business
Days after such termination; and in the case of termination of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b), the fee referred to in the
preceding sentence shall be paid by the Company concurrently with such
termination.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not be required to pay the
termination fee provided for in this Section 8.5(c) more than once.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.5(c)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent or Purchaser would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay when due any
amount payable under Section 8.5(c) then: (i) the Company shall reimburse
Parent for all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such
overdue amount and the enforcement by Parent of its rights under such
Sections; and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue
amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is
actually paid to Parent in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate"
(as announced by Bank of America or any successor thereto) in effect on the
date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

(e) If Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement and receive a fee
pursuant to Section 8.5(c) (other than a termination by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.4(a) in circumstances involving an intentional or willful breach of
any covenant contained in this Agreement), termination of this Agreement and
the collection by Parent of such fee will constitute liquidated damages and be
the sole and exclusive remedy regardless of the circumstances of such
termination.

Section 8.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each
party will bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.7 _Amendment_. Subject to Section 1.4(b), this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, (1) after Purchaser purchases any Shares
pursuant to the Offer, no amendment will be made that decreases the Merger
Consideration, and (2) after adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
Shares, no amendment may be made that by Law or any applicable rule or
regulation of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the holders
of Shares without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

Section 8.8 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (1) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties hereto, (2) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (3) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, 



 

65  waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein, except that the Minimum Tender Condition may only
be waived by Purchaser with the prior written consent of the Company. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in
exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim
arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or
remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



 

73 Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and

obligations covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Purchaser and the

hereof, including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and
undertakings that are required to be performed discharged or complied with
following the Control Time.

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties will be entitled, without proof of actual
damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such
matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located
in the State of Delaware; this being in addition to any other remedy to which
such party is entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties
hereto (1) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (3) agrees that
it will not bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other
than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable
law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts,
any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware. Service of
any process, summons, notice or document to any partys address and in the
manner set forth in Section 9.2 shall be effective service of process for any
such action. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this Agreement
or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party in such
action or suit shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such
action or suit. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES, AGREES
AND CERTIFIES THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD, 



 

74  IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO PREVENT OR DELAY ENFORCEMENT OF EITHER
OF SUCH WAIVERS; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVERS; (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

Section 9.12 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference will be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or" will not be exclusive. Whenever used in this Agreement, any
noun or pronoun will be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular
and to cover all genders. This Agreement will be construed without regard to
any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against
the party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

Section 9.13 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. (a) Except for the
representations and warranties contained this Agreement, neither the Company
nor any other Person on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes
any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiary or with respect to any other information provided by
the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Purchaser or any other Person on behalf of Parent

  ANNEX I

_CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not otherwise defined herein
will have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is
attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

1\. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Agreement,
Purchaser will not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under
the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to
pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and may
terminate or, subject to the terms of the Agreement, amend the Offer, unless,
immediately prior to the expiration of the offering period for the Offer, as
the same may be extended from time to time (the " _Expiration Date_ "):

(a) there will have been validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn that number of Shares that, together with the number of Shares, if
any, then owned beneficially by Parent and Purchaser (together with their
wholly-owned Subsidiaries), constitutes at least a majority of the total
number of then-outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis (the " _Minimum
Tender Condition_ ");

(b) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement will have expired or been
terminated; and

(c) any waiting period required to consummate the Offer or the Merger under
foreign antitrust or competition-related Laws shall have expired or have been
terminated, and any Consent required under such foreign antitrust or
competition-related Law in connection with the Offer or the Merger shall have
been obtained and be in full force and effect.

2\. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the
Agreement, Purchaser will not be required to accept for payment or, subject
to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c)
under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or
return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the
Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and may
terminate or, subject to the terms of the Agreement, amend the Offer, unless,
immediately prior to the Expiration Date:

(a) no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order preventing the acquisition of or payment for shares of Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer or preventing consummation of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement shall have been issued by
any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity and remain
in effect, and there shall not be any Law enacted or deemed applicable to the
Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
Agreement that makes the acquisition of or payment for shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, or the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, illegal; (b) there shall not be pending any Proceeding to which any Governmental Entity
is a party: (i) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the
acquisition of or payment for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by the Agreement; (ii) relating to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement and seeking to obtain from Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries any damages or other relief that
may be material to Parent or the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iii) seeking
to prohibit or limit in any material respect Parents ability to hold,
transfer, vote, receive dividends with respect to or otherwise exercise
ownership rights with respect to the stock of Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation; (iv) that could materially and adversely affect the right of
Parent or any of the Company and its Subsidiaries to own the assets or operate
the business of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries; or (v) seeking to
compel the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to
dispose of or hold separate any shares of Common Stock or any material assets
as a result of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement;

(c) no change, effect, event or occurrence will have occurred since the date
of the Agreement that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

(d) (i) each of the representations and warranties of the Company contained
in the Agreement, other than the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 4.3(a) or the first and third sentence of Section 4.3(b), Section
4.4(b), Section 4.21 and Section 4.23, shall be accurate in all respects as
of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as if made on and
as of the Expiration Date (other than any such representation and warranty
made as of a specific earlier date, which shall have been accurate in all
respects as of such earlier date), except that any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties will be disregarded if the circumstances giving
rise to all such inaccuracies (considered collectively) do not constitute,
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
_provided, however_ , that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such
representations and warranties: (A) all materiality qualifications limiting
the scope of such representations and warranties shall be disregarded; and (B)
any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or
purported to have been made on or after the date of the Agreement shall be
disregarded; and (ii) each of the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 4.3(a), the first and third sentence of Section 4.3(b), Section
4.4(b), Section 4.21 and Section 4.23 shall have been accurate in all
material respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration
Date as if made on and as of the Expiration Date (other than any of such
representation and warranties made as of a specific earlier date, which shall
have been accurate in all material respects as of such earlier date);
_provided, however,_ that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such
representations and warranties: (A) all materiality qualifications limiting
the scope of such representations and warranties shall be disregarded; and
(B) any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or
purported to have been made on or after the date of the Agreement shall be
disregarded; (e) the Company will have complied in all material respect with all of its
obligations, covenants, and agreements under the Agreement;

(f) Parent and the Company will have received a certificate executed by
the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer confirming
that the conditions set forth in paragraphs 2(c), 2(d) and 2(e) of this _Annex
I_ have been duly satisfied;

(g) the Agreement will not have been terminated pursuant to its terms and will
not have been amended pursuant to its terms to provide for such termination
or amendment of the Offer which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or
Purchaser, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance
for payment or payment for Shares; and

(h) no Triggering Event shall have occurred.

The conditions set forth in paragraphs 1. and 2. of this Annex I are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and, subject to Section 1.1, may be
waived by Parent or Purchaser (except for the Minimum Tender Condition) in
whole or in part at any time or from time to time prior to the Expiration Date
in the sole discretion of Parent and Purchaser. The failure of Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right will be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time or from time to time.
