AHGP Common Units: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) All of the limited liability company interests in Merger

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The general partner interest in AHGP issued and outstanding

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Each Outstanding AHGP Common Unit (other than AHGP Common
Units held by SGP) shall be converted into the right to receive a number of
Exchange Units equal to the Exchange Ratio, and the Outstanding AHGP Common
Units held by SGP immediately prior to the Merger shall be converted into the
right to receive a number of Exchange Units equal to (i) the product of (A)
the aggregate number of Outstanding AHGP Common Units held by SGP and (B) the
Exchange Ratio, minus (ii) the aggregate number of New ARLP Common Units. The
Exchange Units and any cash paid in lieu of any fractional Exchange Unit are
collectively referred to herein as the "AHGP Unitholder Consideration." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) All AHGP Common Units, when converted as a result of and
pursuant to the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and cease to exist. At the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate representing AHGP Common Units (a "Certificate") and each holder
of non-certificated AHGP Common Units represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry
Units") shall cease to be a unitholder of AHGP and (except as set forth in
Section 4.2) cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive (i) such holder's portion of the AHGP Unitholder Consideration,
including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Exchange Unit in
accordance with Section 4.3(e), and the right to be admitted as a limited
partner of ARLP in connection therewith, and (ii) any distributions in
accordance with Section 4.3(c), and in each case, to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with Section 4.2. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.2 Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers. At the
Effective Time, holders of AHGP Common Units shall cease to be, and shall have
no rights as, unitholders of AHGP, other than to receive (a) any distribution
with respect to such AHGP Common Units with a record date occurring prior to
the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by AHGP on such AHGP
Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remains
unpaid at the Effective Time and (b) the consideration provided under this
Article IV. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the unit
transfer books of AHGP with respect to the AHGP Common Units. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.3 Exchange Procedures. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Exchange Agent. Promptly after the Effective Time, AHGP
shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of AHGP Common Units, for exchange in accordance with
this Article IV, through the Exchange Agent, the AHGP Unitholder
Consideration required by this Article IV. AHGP agrees to make available to
the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
distributions pursuant to Section 4.2(a) and Section 4.3(c) and to make
payments in lieu of any fractional Exchange Units pursuant to Section 4.3(e).
Any cash and Exchange Units deposited with the Exchange Agent \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t12  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(including as payment for any fractional Exchange Units in accordance
with Section 4.3(e) and any distributions in accordance with Section 4.3(c))
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the AHGP Unitholder
Consideration contemplated to be paid for AHGP Common Units pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 4.3(c)
and 4.3(e), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,
AHGP shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of AHGP
Common Units as of the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that in respect of certificated units, delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in customary
form and agreed to by AGP and AHGP prior to the Effective Time) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Units in exchange for the AHGP Unitholder Consideration payable in
respect of the AHGP Common Units represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Units. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of
Certificates, if any, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with
such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such
other documents (including in respect of Book-Entry Units) as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holders of AHGP Common Units shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) Exchange Units representing, in
the aggregate, the whole number of Exchange Units that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this Article IV (after taking into account all
AHGP Common Units then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount
equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this Article IV, including cash payable in lieu of any
fractional Exchange Units pursuant to Section 4.3(e) and distributions
pursuant to Section 4.3(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any AHGP
Unitholder Consideration (including any cash amount payable in lieu of any
fractional Exchange Units pursuant to Section 4.3(e)) or on any unpaid
distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of AHGP Common Units that is not registered
in the transfer records of AHGP, the AHGP Unitholder Consideration payable in
respect of such AHGP Common Units may be paid to a transferee, if the
Certificate representing such AHGP Common Units or evidence of ownership of
the Book-Entry Units are presented to the Exchange Agent, and in the case of
both certificated and book-entry Common Units, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any amounts required to be
withheld, any transfer taxes or other similar taxes required by reason of the
delivery of the AHGP Unitholder Consideration in any name other than that of
the record holder of such AHGP Common Units, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that any amounts required to be withheld,
any transfer taxes or other similar taxes have been paid or are not payable.
Until the required documentation has been delivered and Certificates, if any,
have been surrendered, as contemplated by this Section 4.3, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the AHGP Unitholder
Consideration payable in respect of the AHGP Common Units and any cash in lieu
of fractional units pursuant to Section 4.3(e) and any distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.2. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged AHGP Common
Units. No distributions declared or made with respect to Exchange Units with a
record date after the Effective \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t13  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tTime shall be paid to the holder of any AHGP Common Units with respect
to the Exchange Units that such holder would be entitled to receive in
accordance herewith and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Exchange Units
shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall deliver the required
documentation and surrender any Certificate as contemplated by this Section
4.3. Subject to applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of
Section 4.3(b), there shall be paid to such holder of the Exchange Units
issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time
of such compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
Exchange Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.3(e) and
the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to the Exchange Units and payable with respect
to such Exchange Units and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such compliance payable with
respect to such Exchange Units. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Further Rights in AHGP Units. The AHGP Unitholder
Consideration distributed upon conversion of an AHGP Common Unit in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
4.2, Section 4.3(c) or Section 4.3(e)) shall be deemed to have been
distributed in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such AHGP Common
Unit. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Fractional Exchange Units. No certificates or scrip of the
Exchange Units representing fractional Exchange Units or book-entry credit of
the same shall be issued upon the exchange of AHGP Common Units in accordance
with Section 4.3(b), and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Exchange Units.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of AHGP
Common Units exchanged in connection with the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of an Exchange Unit (after taking into
account all AHGP Common Units exchanged by such holder), shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest, rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in
an amount equal to the product of (i) the volume weighted average trading
price of the Exchange Units as reported by Bloomberg during the 20 trading day
period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the date on which
the Effective Time shall occur and (ii) the fraction of an Exchange Unit that
such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article
IV. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent
shall so notify AHGP, and AHGP shall deposit such amount with the Exchange
Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders
of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms
hereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund constituting Exchange Units or cash that remains undistributed to the
holders of AHGP Common Units after 180 days following the Effective Time shall
be delivered to AHGP upon demand by AHGP and, from and after such delivery,
any former holders of AHGP Common Units who have not theretofore complied with
this Article IV shall thereafter look only to AHGP for the AHGP Unitholder
Consideration payable in respect of such AHGP Common Units, any cash in lieu
of fractional Exchange Units to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
4.3(e) and any distributions with respect to the AHGP Common Units to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 4.3(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of AHGP Common
Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any governmental entity shall, to the extent
permitted by \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t14  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tapplicable Law, become the property of AHGP, free and clear of any
Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) No Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by Law,
neither AGP nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of AHGP
Common Units for any Exchange Units (or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by AHGP, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as AHGP may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the AHGP Unitholder
Consideration payable in respect of the AHGP Common Units represented by such
Certificate and any distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 4.2. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Withholding. The Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of AHGP Common Units such
amounts as the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of AHGP Common Units in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Book Entry and Admission of Holders of Exchange Units as
Additional Limited Partners of ARLP. All Exchange Units to be distributed in
connection with the Merger shall be distributed in book entry form, without
physical certificates. Upon the distribution of Exchange Units to the holders
of AHGP Common Units in accordance with this Section 4.3 and the compliance by
such holders with the requirements of Section 10.3 of the ARLP Partnership
Agreement, MGP shall consent to the admission of such holders as limited
partners of ARLP and reflect such admission on the books and records of
ARLP. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.4 Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event of any
subdivisions, reclassifications, recapitalizations, splits, combinations or
distributions in the form of equity interests with respect to the AHGP Common
Units or the Exchange Units, the number of Exchange Units to be distributed in
connection with the Merger and the volume weighted average trading price of
the Exchange Units determined in accordance with Section 4.3(e) will be
correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of Exchange Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.5 Treatment of Deferred Equity Awards. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, all AHGP Deferred Phantom Units that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be paid in full and
deemed to have been converted into shares of AHGP Common Units. By virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t15  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tAHGP Deferred Phantom Units, the AHGP Deferred Phantom Units will be
treated as shares of AHGP Common Units for all purposes of this Agreement,
including the right to receive a portion of the AHGP Unitholder Consideration,
calculated by applying the Exchange Ratio in accordance with Section
4.1(c). \t\t

This Agreement and the AHGP Unitholder Support Agreement represent the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with reference to the transactions
contemplated hereby and supersede any and all other oral or written agreements
heretofore made. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended
to confer upon any person, other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.7 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof
in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.8 Titles and Headings. The article, section and
paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are solely for convenience of

 \t\t\tSection 10.9 Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or the Delaware Court of Chancery, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 10.5 shall
be deemed effective service of process on such party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.11 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent any
breach of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or in the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. \t\t

provided herein, all references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer
to U.S. dollars. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained

succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also

intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all of the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of authorship

laws, with all rights and remedies being governed by said laws. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13. INDEMNIFICATION. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to
be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a
witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"),
by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer or employee of the
Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another company or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an
employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "Indemnitee"), whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as an officer, employee
or agent or in any other capacity while serving as such an officer, employee
or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the full
extent authorized by the Act, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than
said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), or by
other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and
loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or
penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably
incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith and such
indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be an
officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's
heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as
provided in Section 13(b) with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Company shall indemnify any such Indemnitee
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred
in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be
paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses");
further provided,

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t7  \t\t Indemnitee in such person's capacity as an officer or employee (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee while an
officer or employee, including, without limitation, service to an employee
benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this Section 13, or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If a claim under Section 13(a) is not paid in full by the
Company within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Company,
except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case
the applicable period shall be twenty days, the Indemnitee may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the
claim and, to the extent successful in whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall
be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such suit. The
Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this
Section 13 upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to
enforce a claim for an advancement of expenses, where the required
undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Company), and
thereafter the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome the
presumption that the Indemnitee is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the
Company (including its independent legal counsel) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee
is proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination by the Company
(including its independent legal counsel) that the Indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification, shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption
that the Indemnitee is not so entitled. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The indemnification provided pursuant to this Section 13
shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any
Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, as a matter of law, in equity
or otherwise, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns
and administrators of the such Indemnitee. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any officer, employee or agent of the Company or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Act.
The Company may enter into contracts with any Indemnitee in furtherance of the
provisions of this Section and may create a trust fund, grant a security
interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of
credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect
indemnification as provided in this Section 13. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Any person who is or was serving as a director of a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company shall be deemed, for purposes of this Section
13 only, to be an officer or employee of the Company entitled to
indemnification under this Section 13. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The Company may, by action of the Board of Directors or the
Member, from time to time, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses to agents of the Company with the same scope and effect as the
provisions of this Section with respect to the indemnification and advancement
of expenses of officers and employees of the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) No Indemnitee shall be liable to the Company for any act or
omission based upon errors of judgment or other fault in connection with the
business or affairs of the Company, except as provided for in the Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 13 shall be
payable only from the assets of the Company. \t\t

this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the following requirements.
Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed by the Board of Directors or the
Member and shall become effective upon its subsequent approval by the Board of

 \t\t\tINDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY OF INDEMNITEES \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.1 Indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tTo the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to
the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including
legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements
or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in
which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a
party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee; provided, that
the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a
final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.1, the Indemnitee acted in bad
faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct, or in the case of a criminal
matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful;
provided, further, no indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be
available to the General Partner or its Affiliates (other than a Group Member)
with respect to its or their obligations incurred pursuant to the Underwriting
Agreement (other than obligations incurred by the General Partner on behalf of
the Partnership). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be
made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the
General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and
shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the
Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tTo the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is
indemnified pursuant to Section 9.1(a) in defending any claim, demand, action,
suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership
prior to a determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
upon receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 9.1. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe indemnification provided by this Section 9.1 shall
be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled
under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of outstanding
Limited Partner Interests entitled to vote on such matter, as a matter of law
or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee's capacity as an Indemnitee
and as to actions in any other capacity (including any capacity under the
Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased
to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tThe Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse
the General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of
the General Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General
Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against,
or expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the
Partnership's activities or such Person's activities on behalf of the
Partnership, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to
indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this
Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tFor purposes of this Section 9.1, the Partnership shall
be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee
benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership
also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or
participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an
Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law
shall constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 9.1(a); and action
taken or omitted by it with respect 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t5  \t\t reasonably believed by it to be in the best interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is in the
best interests of the Partnership. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tIn no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited
Partner to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tAn Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in
whole or in part under this Section 9.1 because the Indemnitee had an interest
in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tThe provisions of this Section 9.1 are for the benefit
of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and
shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tNo amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 9.1
or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the
right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the
Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such
Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.1 as
in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

 \t\t\t 9.2 Liability of Indemnitees. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the
Partnership, the Limited Partner or any other Persons who have acquired
interests in the securities of the Partnership, for losses sustained or
liabilities incurred as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee
unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court
of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter in
question, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful
misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the
Indemnitee's conduct was criminal. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe General Partner may exercise any of the powers
granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner
shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any
such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tTo the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee
has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to
the Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other
Indemnitee acting in connection with the Partnership's business or affairs
shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith
reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tAny amendment, modification or repeal of this Section
9.2 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way
affect the limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this Section
9.2 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal
with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole
or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of
when such claims may arise or be asserted, and provided such Person became an
Indemnitee hereunder prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.

 \t\t

 \t\t\tINDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY OF INDEMNITEES \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.1 Indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tTo the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to
the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including
legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements
or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in
which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a
party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee; provided, that
the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a
final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.1, the Indemnitee acted in bad
faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct, or in the case of a criminal
matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful;
provided, further, no indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be
available to the General Partner or its Affiliates (other than a Group Member)
with respect to its or their obligations incurred pursuant to the Underwriting
Agreement (other than obligations incurred by the General Partner on behalf of
the Partnership). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be
made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the
General Partner shall not be personally liable for such 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t5  \t\t or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such
indemnification. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tTo the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is
indemnified pursuant to Section 9.1(a) in defending any claim, demand, action,
suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership
prior to a determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
upon receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 9.1. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe indemnification provided by this Section 9.1 shall
be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled
under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of outstanding
Limited Partner Interests entitled to vote on such matter, as a matter of law
or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee's capacity as an Indemnitee
and as to actions in any other capacity (including any capacity under the
Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased
to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tThe Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse
the General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of
the General Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General
Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against,
or expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the
Partnership's activities or such Person's activities on behalf of the
Partnership, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to
indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this
Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tFor purposes of this Section 9.1, the Partnership shall
be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee
benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership
also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or
participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an
Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law
shall constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 9.1(a); and action
taken or omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the
performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the
best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be
deemed to be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tIn no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited
Partner to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tAn Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in
whole or in part under this Section 9.1 because the Indemnitee had an interest
in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tThe provisions of this Section 9.1 are for the benefit
of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and
shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tNo amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 9.1
or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the
right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the
Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such
Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.1 as
in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

 \t\t\t 9.2 Liability of Indemnitees. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the
Partnership, the Limited Partner or any other Persons who have acquired
interests in the securities of the Partnership, for losses sustained or
liabilities incurred as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee
unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court
of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter in
question, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful
misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the
Indemnitee's conduct was criminal. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe General Partner may exercise any of the powers
granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner
shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any
such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tTo the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee
has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to
the Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other
Indemnitee acting in connection with the Partnership's business or affairs
shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith
reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tAny amendment, modification or repeal of this Section
9.2 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way
affect the limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this Section
9.2 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal
with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole
or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of
when such claims may arise or be asserted, and provided such Person became an
Indemnitee hereunder prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.
