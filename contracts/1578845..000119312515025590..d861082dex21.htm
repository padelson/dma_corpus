may



     | (i) | proceed to Completion as far as practicable (without

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | defer Completion to a date being not less than 3 Business
Days (unless the parties otherwise agree) nor more than 10 Business Days

---|--- 



     | (a) | notify the Purchaser of such breach, in sufficient detail to

Purchasers reasonable satisfaction and the breach or breaches remain
uncured); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Vendors are in breach of any of the Warranties as given
at the date of this Agreement, 
---|---|---

serving written notice on the Vendors, terminate this Agreement.

(whether contractual or otherwise, oral or in writing, or made negligently or
otherwise). 
---|--- 



   17.2 | The Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement

supersede and extinguish any prior drafts, previous agreements,
undertakings, representations, warranties, promises, assurances and
arrangements of any nature whatsoever, whether or not in writing, relating to
the subject matter of the Transaction Documents, and set out the complete
legal relationship of the parties arising from or connected with that subject
matter. 
---|--- 



   17.3 | The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it does not rely on
and has not been induced to enter into this Agreement on the basis of, and
shall not have any right to make any claim pursuant to, any Representation
other than those set out in this Agreement, and that, in relation to any
Representation set out in this Agreement, it shall not have any right to make
any claim in tort (including for misrepresentation or negligence), other than
in the event of fraud, in relation to any such Representation. 
---|--- 



   17.4 | Nothing in this Clause 17 shall have the effect of limiting any
liability arising from fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

   17.5 | Save as expressly set out in this Agreement, each partys
rights, powers, privileges and remedies contained in this Agreement are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, privileges or remedies
provided by Law. 
---|--- 
 



27 ---|--- 

Notwithstanding Completion:

 



     | (a) | each provision of this Agreement and any other Transaction
Document not performed at or before Completion but which remains capable of
performance; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the Warranties and Completion Warranties; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | all covenants, indemnities and other undertakings and

   19. | WAIVER AND VARIATION 
---|--- 



   19.1 | Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | any failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or
remedy provided under this Agreement or by Law, whether by conduct or
otherwise, shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy,
nor shall it preclude or restrict any further exercise of that or any other
right or remedy; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | no single or partial exercise of any right or remedy
provided under this Agreement or by Law, whether by conduct or otherwise,
shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or
remedy.  
---|---|--- 



   19.2 | A waiver of any right or remedy under this Agreement shall only
be effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any
subsequent breach or default. 
---|--- 
 



   19.3 | No variation or amendment of this Agreement shall be valid
unless it is in writing and duly executed by or on behalf of all of the
parties to this Agreement. Unless expressly agreed, no variation or amendment
shall constitute a general waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor
shall it affect any rights or obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement
which have already accrued up to the date of variation or amendment and the
rights and obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect except and only to the extent that they are varied or
amended. 
---|--- 



   19.4 | The parties to this Agreement shall not require the consent of
any person having a right to enforce any term of this Agreement under the
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to terminate or vary all or any
part of this Agreement, including any provision pursuant to which any such
person has any such right. 
---|--- 



   20. | INVALIDITY 
---|--- 

Where any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid

provision shall be deemed to be severed from this Agreement and, if possible,
replaced with a lawful provision which, as closely as possible, gives effect
to the intention of the parties under this Agreement and, where permissible,
that shall not affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability in
that, or any other, jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement.

 



28 ---|--- 



   21.1 | Except as provided in this Clause 21 or as the parties
specifically agree in writing, no person shall assign, transfer, mortgage,
charge or otherwise deal with all or any of its rights or benefits under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document nor grant, declare, create or
dispose of, or make any declaration of trust in respect of, any right or
interest in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
---|--- 
 



   21.2 | Subject to Clause 21.3, the Purchaser may assign the whole (but
not part only) of the benefit of this Agreement and/or of any other
Transaction Document to which it is a party, in whole or in part, to:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | at the election of the Purchaser (such election to be
notified to each Vendor prior to the time of such deemed assignment) to
another member of the Purchaser Group (and so that this Clause 21.2 shall
apply to such member of the Purchaser Group) provided that if any body
corporate to which the benefit of this Agreement and/or any Transaction
Document has been assigned pursuant to this Clause 21.2(a) (an "Assignee") is
to cease to be a member of the Purchaser Group, the Assignee shall be deemed,
immediately prior to ceasing to be a member of the Purchaser Group, to assign
all of the rights and benefits under this Agreement which at such time have
been assigned to the Assignee back to the Purchaser or (if so notified by the
Vendors prior to such deemed assignment) to another member of the Purchaser
Group; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | any bank or financial institution lending money or making
other banking facilities available to the Purchaser for the acquisition of the
Shares, by way of security, or any refinancing thereof. 
---|---|--- 
 



   21.3 | Any assignment made pursuant to Clause 21.2 shall be on the
basis that: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Vendors may discharge their respective obligations under
this Agreement to the assignor until the Vendors have received notice of the
assignment from both the assigning party and the assignee; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the liability of any Vendor to any assignee shall not be
greater than his or her liability to the Purchaser; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Purchaser will remain liable for any obligations under
this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   21.4 | The rights of each Vendor under this Agreement, and the benefit
accruing to each Vendor under this Agreement, may: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | pass to such Vendors successors; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | be assigned or transferred, or be the subject matter of a
declaration of trust, or otherwise be alienated in any other way, to any
member of such Vendors family or to any trust some or all of the
beneficiaries of which are or may be members of such Vendors family. 
---|---|--- 



   22. | PAYMENTS, SET OFF AND DEFAULT INTEREST 
---|--- 



   22.1 | Any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement by: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Purchaser to a Vendor shall be made in cash in pounds
sterling to the relevant Vendors Bank Account; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | by any Vendor to the Purchaser shall be made in cash in
pounds sterling to the Purchasers Bank Account, 
---|---|--- 
 



29 in each case by way of electronic transfer in immediately available funds on
or before the due date for payment. Receipt of such sum in such account on or
before the due date for payment in accordance with this Clause 22.1 shall (to
the extent of the sum so received) be a good discharge by the payor of its
obligation to make such payment (and the payor shall not be concerned with or
responsible for the application or allocation of any such sum).



   22.2 | Where any payment is made in satisfaction of a liability arising
under this Agreement or under the Tax Deed of Covenant (including the payment
out of any Charged Amount of any Due Amount to the Purchaser by the
Security Bank) it shall be an adjustment to the Final Initial Consideration. 
---|--- 



   22.3 | All payments made by any party to this Agreement under this
Agreement, or any of the other Transaction Documents, shall be made free from
any set-off, counterclaim or other deduction or withholding of any
nature whatsoever, except for deductions or withholdings required to be made
by Law. If any deduction or withholding is required by any applicable Law on
any payments made under this Agreement (other than any payment of interest or
any payment made pursuant to Clause 3, Clause 5, Schedule 4 or Schedule 9),
the party making the payment must: (a) provide to the recipient of the payment
such evidence of the relevant withholding as the recipient may reasonably
require; and (b) pay to the recipient of the payment an amount that will
ensure that, after the deduction or withholding has been made, the recipient
will have received a sum equal to the amount that the recipient would
otherwise have received in the absence of the deduction or withholding. 
---|--- 



   22.4 | If a Tax Authority charges to Tax any sum paid (the "original
payment") to a party under this Agreement (other than any payment of interest
or any payment made pursuant to Clause 3, Clause 5, Schedule 4 or Schedule
9), the party making the payment will be obliged to pay to the recipient of
the payment an additional amount (the "additional payment") as will ensure
that, after the payment of the Tax so charged on the original payment and any
Tax chargeable on the additional payment, there will remain a net sum equal to
the amount of the original payment, the additional payment to be paid three
Business Days after the recipient has served notice that Tax on the original
payment has become due and payable, or, in the case of a relief being
available, would have become due and payable but for the availability of such
relief. 
---|--- 
 



   22.5 | Where a Vendor or the Purchaser defaults in the payment when due
of any sum payable pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Documents the liability of such Vendor or the Purchaser (as the case may be)
shall be increased to include an amount equal to interest on such sum from
the date when payment is due to the date of actual payment (both before and
after judgment) at that annual rate which is 2% per annum above the base
lending rate of HSBC Bank plc from time to time in effect during such period.
Such interest shall accrue from day to day and be compounded quarterly and
shall be payable without prejudice to any other remedy available to the
Vendors or the Purchaser (as the case may be) in respect of such default. 
---|---

each case not actually or prospectively in force at the date of this

purposes includes the Group Companies only after Completion) or any director,
employee, authorised agent or adviser of a member of the Purchasers Group; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | to the extent that the matter giving rise to the Claim is an
amount for which any Group Company has a right of recovery against, or an

notice of the relevant Claim to the Vendors notwithstanding the fact that the
liability may not have become an actual liability. The fact that the liability
may not have become an actual liability within the time limits provided in

---|--- 

If a Vendor pays the Purchaser any amount in respect of a Claim (other than a
Claim under the Tax Warranties) and the Purchaser or any member of the
Purchaser Group subsequently becomes entitled to recover from a third party a
sum which is referable to that Claim (other than a Claim under the Tax
Warranties), the Purchaser shall give notice to such Vendor, and shall and
shall procure that any relevant member of the Purchaser Group shall, use all
reasonable endeavours to recover from such third party. If any amount is
actually recovered from such third party, then, after the deduction of the
reasonable costs of the Purchaser and each member of the Purchaser Group in
obtaining such recovery and any Tax payable on such recovery, the balance (up
to the amount actually paid by the relevant Vendor to the Purchaser) shall be
repaid by the Purchaser to the Vendors.



   6. | NO DUPLICATION OF RECOVERY

otherwise howsoever). 
---|--- 



   6.2 | In the event that the Purchaser is entitled to claim under the
Tax Deed of Covenant or under the Warranties or Completion Warranties in
respect of the same liability, the Purchaser may claim under either or both
but payments under the Tax Deed of Covenant shall pro tanto satisfy and
discharge any claim which is capable of being made under the Warranties or
Completion Warranties in respect of the same liability and vice versa. 
---|--- 
 



   7. | CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS 
---|--- 



   7.1 | If the Purchaser becomes aware of any claim by a third party (a
"Third Party Claim") after Completion which is likely to result in a Claim
(other than a Claim under the Tax Warranties), the Purchaser shall promptly
give notice of the Third Party Claim to the Vendors and, subject to the
Purchaser and each member of the Purchaser Group being indemnified and secured
to the Purchasers reasonable satisfaction by the Vendors against
all reasonable costs and expenses, including those of its legal advisers,
incurred in respect of that Third Party Claim as a result of, or in connection
with, doing any such thing, shall and shall procure that the Group Companies
shall:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | not make any knowing admission of liability or make any
agreement or compromise in relation to that Third Party Claim without the
prior consent of the Vendors; 
---|---|--- 
 



66 chattels, documents and records (which the Purchaser shall procure are
preserved) to the Vendors and their professional advisers as any Vendor may
reasonably request and all such assistance as any Vendor (or their
professional advisers) may reasonably require; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | (subject to the Purchaser being entitled to engage its own
legal advisers) take such action as the Vendors may reasonably request to
avoid, resist, dispute, appeal, compromise, remedy or defend that Third Party
Claim, except where, in the reasonable opinion of the Purchaser, such action
would be materially prejudicial to the business of the Purchaser or any of the
Group Companies, would be misleading or inaccurate in any material respect or
would materially affect the future liability to Tax of any Group Company
(provided that (the "Proviso Exception") in such circumstances the Vendors
shall not be obliged to indemnify the Purchaser for any costs and expenses
incurred in relation to such Third Party Claim (but provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Proviso Exception shall not operate to release any
Vendor from any liability it may have under any Claim arising out of such
Third Party Claim). 
---|---|--- 
 



   7.2 | The rights of the Vendors under paragraph 7.1 shall only apply to
a Third Party Claim if a Vendor gives notice to the Purchaser in writing of
its intention to exercise its rights within 20 Business Days of the
Purchaser giving notice of the Third Party Claim. If neither Vendor gives
notice during that period, the Purchaser shall be entitled in its absolute
discretion to settle, compromise, or resist any action, proceedings or claim
against any member of the Purchaser Group out of which that Third Party Claim
arises. 
---|--- 



   7.3 | The Purchaser shall not be precluded from bringing any Claim
under this Agreement by reason of any breach of the terms of this paragraph 7. 
---|--- 
 



   8. | MITIGATION

Nothing in this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to relieve or abrogate the
Purchaser of any common law duty to mitigate any loss or damage suffered or
incurred by it or any member of the Purchasers Group as a result of any Claim
including, without limitation, enforcing against any person (other than the
Vendors) any rights any member of the Purchasers Group has in respect of the
fact, matter or circumstance giving rise to the Claim or other claim to the
extent it is reasonable and proportionate for the Purchaser to do the same.

 



   9. | PROVISION OF INFORMATION 
---|--- 

If, at any time after the date of this Agreement, any Vendor wants to insure
against its liabilities in respect of Claims or other claims under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the Purchaser shall provide, or
procure that any member of the Purchaser Group shall provide, such information
as a prospective insurer may reasonably require before effecting the
insurance.



   10. | PRESERVATION OF INFORMATION 
---|--- 

The Purchaser shall, and shall ensure that each Group Company and each member
of the Purchasers Group will, preserve all documents, records,
correspondence, accounts and other information whatsoever relevant to a matter
which may give rise to a Claim or claim under the Tax Covenant.

The provisions of the Tax Deed of Covenant shall also apply to any claim
under the Tax Warranties to the extent specified therein.

against any Vendor under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the
Purchaser shall, subject to the Vendors giving such undertakings as to
confidentiality as the Purchaser may reasonably require, procure that the
Vendors and their Representatives are provided, upon reasonable notice and
during Working Hours and at the Vendors cost, access to such information,
records, premises and personnel of the Purchaser or any member of the
Purchasers Group as any Vendor may reasonably require (not being any which
would otherwise be subject to legal privilege) to investigate, avoid, remedy,
dispute, resist, appeal, compromise or contest such claim.

the Vendors (in their Respective Proportions) any increase in the amount of
any such Earn-out Payment following such adjustment. 
---|--- 
 



   5.3 | If the Purchaser and the Vendors do not reach agreement as to the
occurrence or effect of any breach set out in a Breach Notice, in each case

   5.5 | For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of paragraphs 5.2 to
5.4 shall apply to Earn-out Periods in relation to which an Earn-out Payment
has already been paid (as well as to any Earn-out Period in relation to
which the Earn-out Payment has yet to be agreed or determined), and any
reference in this Schedule 9 to any Earn-out Statement being final and binding
shall not be taken to prevent the serving of any Breach Notice or the
adjustment of any Earn-out Payment in relation to any Earn-out Period in
relation to which such Earn-out Statement relates. 
---|--- 



   5.6 | Nothing in paragraph 5.1 shall restrict the Purchaser Group from
acquiring a Competing ******** Product or a company or group that sells,
markets or distributes a Competing ******** Product. In the event that

group that sells, markets or distributes a Competing ******** Product, the
amount of ******** Net Sales for: (i) the Earn-out Period in which the
acquisition occurs and (ii) any remaining Earn-out Periods shall be equal to
the amount of ******** Net Sales in the Earn-out Period immediately prior to
the date that the Purchaser Group acquires a Competing ******** Product or, in
the event of such an acquisition in the First Earn-out Period , the amount of
the ******** Net Sales in the three month period preceding the Completion Date
(as if such three month period were an Earn-out Period).

     | (ii) | where such Due Amount (having deducted any amount settled
without recourse to such Vendors Blocked Account) is less than the Reserved
Amount retained (if any) in respect of the relevant Settled Claim and, if
such Reserved Amount (if any) had equalled the Due Amount, any additional
