1.3   _Certain Interpretations_

  



  

(a)   _References to this Agreement._ Unless otherwise
indicated, when a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Recital, Schedule or Exhibit, that reference is to an Article, Section,
Recital, Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, as applicable.

  



  

(b)   _Hereof, Including, etc._ When used in this Agreement, (i)
the words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import will,
unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; and (ii) the words
"include," "includes" and "including" will be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation."

  



  

(c)   _Neither, etc._ Unless the context otherwise requires,
"neither," "nor," "any," "either" and "or" are not exclusive.

  



  

(d)   _Extent._ The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and does not
simply mean "if."

  



  

(e)   _Dollars._ When used in this Agreement, references to "$"
or "Dollars" are references to United States dollars.

  



  

(f)   _Gender and Number._ The meaning assigned to each
capitalized term defined and used in this Agreement is equally applicable to
both the singular and the plural forms of such term, and words denoting any
gender include all genders. Where a word or phrase is defined in this
Agreement, each of its other grammatical forms has a corresponding meaning.
All terms defined in this Agreement will have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant to this
Agreement unless otherwise defined in such certificate or document.

  



  

(g)   _References to Parties._ When reference is made to any
party to this Agreement or any other agreement or document, such reference
includes that party's successors and permitted assigns. References to any
Person include the successors and permitted assigns of that Person.

  



  

(h)   _References to Subsidiaries._ Unless the context otherwise
requires, all references in this Agreement to the Subsidiaries of a Person
will be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person.

  



  

(i)   _Writings._ References to "writing" mean the
representation or reproduction of words, symbols or other information in a
visible form by any method or combination of methods, whether in electronic
form or otherwise, and including writings delivered by Electronic Delivery.
"Written" will be construed in the same manner.

  



  

   

20

 

    



  

(j)   _Legislation._ A reference to any specific legislation
or to any provision of any legislation includes any amendment to, and any
modification, re-enactment or successor thereof, any legislative provision
substituted therefor and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments
issued thereunder or pursuant thereto, except that, for purposes of any
representations and warranties in this Agreement that are made as a specific
date, references to any specific legislation will be deemed to refer to such
legislation or provision (and all rules, regulations and statutory
instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto) as of such date.
References to any agreement or Contract are to that agreement or Contract as
amended, modified or supplemented from time to time.

  



  

(k)   _Accounting Matters._ Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all accounting terms used in this Agreement will be interpreted,
and all accounting determinations hereunder will be made, in accordance with
GAAP. An item arising with respect to a specific representation or warranty
will be deemed to be "reflected on" or "set forth in" a balance sheet or
financial statements, to the extent that any such phrase appears in such
representation or warranty, if (i) there is a reserve, accrual or other
similar item underlying a number on such balance sheet or financial statements
that is related to the subject matter of such representation; (ii) such item
is otherwise specifically set forth on the balance sheet or
financial statements; or (iii) such item is reflected on the balance sheet or
financial statements and is specifically set forth in the notes thereto.

  



  

(l)   _Headings._ The table of contents and headings set forth
in this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and will not
affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any term or provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(m)   _Calculation of Time Periods._ Unless otherwise indicated,
(i) when calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
will be excluded; (ii) if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
then the period in question will end on the next Business Day; (iii) the
measure of a period of one month or year for purposes of this Agreement will
be the day of the following month or year corresponding to the starting date;
and (iv) if no corresponding date exists, then the end date of such period
being measured will be the next actual day of the following month or year (for
example, one month following February 18 is March 18 and one month following
March 31 is May 1). References to "from" or "through" any date mean, unless
otherwise specified, from and including or through and including such date,
respectively.

  



  

(n)   _Joint Drafting._ The Parties agree that they have been
represented by legal counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement. Accordingly, they waive the application of any Law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

  



  

(o)   _Summaries._ No summary of this Agreement or any Exhibit,
Schedule or other document delivered with this Agreement that is prepared by
or on behalf of any Party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or such Exhibit, Schedule or document.

  



  

   

21

 

    



  

(p)   _No Admission._ The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Company Disclosure Letter is disclosed solely for
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
will be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third Person of any
matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of Law or breach of contract;
or (ii) that such information is material or that such information is
required to be referred to or disclosed under this Agreement. Disclosure of
any information or document in the Company Disclosure Letter is not a
statement or admission that it is material or required to be disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter
constitutes an admission against the Company's interest or represents the
Company's legal position or legal rights on the matter so disclosed.

  



  

(q)   _No Reliance by Others on Representations._ The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with _Section 8.5_ without notice or liability
to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any
of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely on
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  



  

(r)   _Made Available._ Documents or other information or
materials will be deemed to have been "made available" by the Company if such
documents, information or materials have been, at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i) posted to a
virtual data room managed by the Company at Datasite; (ii) filed with
or furnished to the SEC and available on EDGAR; or (iii) delivered or
provided via electronic mail or hard copy form to Parent or its
Representatives.

  



  

1.4   _Disclosure Letters._ The information set forth in each of
the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on
the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter") and in the
disclosure letter delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company on the
date of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter") is disclosed under
separate Section and subsection references that correspond to the Sections and
subsections of this Agreement to which such information relates. The
information set forth in each Section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, shall
qualify, irrespective of whether the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable, is referenced in such representation,
warranty or covenant, (a) the representations, warranties or covenants of the
Company or Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, that are set forth in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable, that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the
case of this clause (b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations,
warranties or covenants is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure.

  



  

Article II 
 THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

  



  

2.1   _The Offer._

  



  

(a)   _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than July 31, 2020 (subject to the Company having timely
provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.3(e)_ ), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated
by the SEC under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company
Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_ ), at a price
per share of Company Common Stock equal to the Offer Price, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, net to the seller in cash without interest, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

   

22

 

    



  

(b)   _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of
Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and
pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the
Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
under this Agreement) of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (as they may
be amended in accordance with this Agreement, collectively, the "Offer
Conditions"). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the
"Offer to Purchase") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
Minimum Tender Condition, and the other Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger
Sub expressly reserve the right to (but are not required to) increase the
Offer Price, waive any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition, which is non-waivable) or modify the terms of the Offer in their
sole discretion; except that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) add to
the Offer Conditions or change, modify or waive any Offer Condition in a
manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock in its capacity as such,
(iv) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date (except as required or
permitted by the provisions of _Section 2.1(c)_ ) or (v) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer.

  



  

(c)   _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The initial
expiration date of the Offer (the "Initial Expiration Date") shall be one
minute after 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the later of (i) the twentieth
(20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) and (ii) the No-
Shop Period Start Date, unless the Initial Expiration Date has been extended
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this _Section 2.1(c)_
or as required by applicable law or the interpretations of the SEC (the
Initial Expiration Date or such later time and date on which the Initial
Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to, and in accordance with this
Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). Subject to the parties' rights to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and Merger Sub's right to
waive any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition), Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer from time
to time (i) as required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position
of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer, and (ii) if, as of
the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition shall not have been
satisfied or waived, at the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer on one or more occasions
in consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days (calculated as set
forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) each (or such longer period
as the parties hereto may agree) until such time as each such condition shall
have been satisfied or waived; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) in no event
shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date
or the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article VIII_
, (2) if, at any otherwise scheduled Expiration Date, all of the Offer
Conditions except for the Minimum Tender Condition shall have been satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub shall in such situation be required to extend the Offer
in consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days each but in no
event more than fifteen (15) Business Days in the aggregate (or such other
period as the parties hereto may agree), (3) Merger Sub may extend the Offer
for up to five (5) Business Days in order to determine whether the Offer
Condition set forth in clause (c) of _Exhibit A_ has been satisfied, and (4)
Merger Sub shall extend the Offer if requested by the Company Board, or may
extend the Offer at its election, in accordance with _Section 5.3 _ for the
number of Business Days provided therein. The Offer shall not be extended by
Merger Sub except as specifically provided in this _Section 2.1(c)_. The
Offer may not be terminated prior to its Expiration Date (as such Expiration
Date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this _Section 2.1(c)_
) unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with  _Article
VIII_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article
VIII_ prior to any scheduled expiration thereof, Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day after such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the
Offer.

  



  

   

23

 

    



  

(d)   _Payment_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) promptly after the Expiration Date, accept for payment (the time of
such acceptance, the "Acceptance Time"), and after the Acceptance Time pay
for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided
to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of
Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer. The Offer Price shall, subject to any required withholding of
Taxes, be net to the seller in cash without interest, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer.

  



  

(e)   _Termination of the Offer_. If the Offer is terminated by
Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_
, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock
to the registered holders thereof in accordance with the terms of the Offer
and applicable Law.

  



  

2.2   _Offer Documents._

  



  

(a)  As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto,
the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which shall include or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and a form of the related
letter of transmittal (such Schedule TO and the documents included
therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws.

  



  

   

24

 

    



  

(b)  The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to Parent, Merger Sub and Parent's legal counsel all information
concerning the Acquired Entities and the Company Stockholders that is
reasonably requested by any of them so as to enable Parent and Merger Sub to
comply with their obligations under _Section 2.2(a)_. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by Parent
or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents.
Prior to the public disclosure of a Company Board Recommendation Change in
compliance with _Section 5.3_ or at any time thereafter that such Company
Board Recommendation Change is no longer in effect, Parent and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer
Documents. Notwithstanding any confidentiality obligation owed to the Company
(including under the Confidentiality Agreement), Parent and Merger Sub may
include in the Offer Documents any material nonpublic information concerning
the Company to the extent required to comply with the requirements of the
Exchange Act, including Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the
Company Board Recommendation as it may be amended or modified, and until but
not after it is withdrawn, in each case as permitted by this Agreement, and to
the inclusion of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 (as defined below) with the
Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of the shares of Company Common
Stock.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the Offer Documents and any amendments and supplements
thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC or dissemination of such
documents to the Company Stockholders, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments (that are provided in
a timely manner) made by the Company. Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) provide
the Company with a copy of any written comments or telephonic notification of
any oral comments Parent or Merger Sub may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments (and shall give the Company prompt telephonic notice of any material
discussions with the SEC staff), (ii) provide the Company a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the responses to any such comments and
a copy of any proposed written responses thereto prior to the filing thereof,
and (iii) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments that
are provided in a timely manner by the Company on any such responses.

  



  

2.3   _Company Actions._

  



  

(a)   _Approval_. Subject to _Section 5.3_ , the Company hereby
approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.
The directors and named executive officers (as that term is defined in Item
402 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act) as of the date hereof who own
shares of Company Common Stock and are set forth on _Schedule A_ have agreed
to, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, tender such shares
pursuant to the Offer pursuant to the Support Agreement, the form of which is
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. The Company agrees that no shares of Company
Common Stock held by the Company (other than any such shares held on behalf
of third parties) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

  



  

   

25

 

    



  

(b)   _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date the Offer Documents are
filed with the SEC, following the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"), including the
Company Board Recommendation (subject to _Section 5.3_ ) and a description
thereof, reflecting that the Merger is governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL
and shall be consummated as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time,
and (following or contemporaneously with the initial dissemination of the
Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws) cause the Schedule
14D-9 and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Common
Stock as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. The Schedule 14D-9
shall also contain the notice of appraisal required to be delivered by the
Company under Section 262(d) of the DGCL at the time the Company first files
the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. The Company shall set the record date for
the Company Stockholders to receive such notice of appraisal as the same date
as the Stockholder List Date and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9
including such notice of appraisal to the Company Stockholders to the extent
required by Section 262(d) of the DGCL. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to
the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or as otherwise reasonably
requested by the Company so as to enable the Company to comply with its
obligations under this _Section 2.3(b)_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take
all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by the Company with respect
to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Except with respect to
any amendments filed after a Company Board Recommendation Change (and while
such Company Board Recommendation Change remains in effect) or in
connection with any disclosures made pursuant to and in compliance with
_Section 5.3_ , (i) Parent shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments and supplements thereto
prior to filing such documents with the SEC or dissemination of such
documents to the Company Stockholders, and the Company shall give reasonable
and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent or its legal
counsel, and (ii) the Company shall (A) provide Parent and its legal counsel
with a copy of any written comments or telephonic notification of any oral
comments the Company may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments (and shall give
Parent and its legal counsel prompt telephonic notice of any material
discussions with the SEC staff), (B) provide Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the responses to any such
comments and a copy of any proposed written responses thereto prior to
the filing thereof, and (C) give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made that are provided in a timely manner by Parent or its legal
counsel on any such responses.

  



  

   

26

 

    



  

(c)   _Information Supplied by the Company_. The Company
covenants and agrees that none of the Schedule 14D-9 and any information
supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Offer Documents shall, at the date it is first filed with
the SEC or at the Acceptance Time or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and the Schedule 14D-9 will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act;
_provided_ that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Schedule 14D-9
to the extent based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the preparation of the Schedule 14D-9 for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

  



  

(d)   _Information Supplied by Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub covenants and agrees that none of the Offer Documents
and any information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 shall, at the
date it is first filed with the SEC or at the Acceptance Time or at the time
of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and the Offer
Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act; _provided_  that no representation or
warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents to the extent based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the
preparation of the Offer Documents for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

  



  

(e)   _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish to Merger Sub or its
designated agent promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days
following the date hereof) with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of a
recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Company's
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common
Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance
(including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and
computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the holders of Company Common Stock. The date of the list used to determine
the persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first
disseminated is referred to as the "Stockholder List Date". Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence
the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use
such information only in connection with the Transactions and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, return to the Company or
destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control and
promptly certify to the Company in writing that all such material shall have
been returned or destroyed.

28

 

    



  

2.9   _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent, at the Closing, resignations

2.10   _Effect on Capital Stock._

  



  

(a)   _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following will
occur:

  



  

(i)  each share of common stock of Merger Sub that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation, and each certificate representing ownership of
such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

  



  

(ii)  each share of Company Common Stock that is held by the
Company as treasury stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Owned Company Shares") will be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor; and

  



  

(iii)  each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest
thereon and subject to any required withholding of Taxes, in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 2.12_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required)
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.14_).

  



  

   

29

 

    



  

(b)   _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger
Consideration will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

(c)   _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

  



  

(i)   _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock
that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by Company Stockholders who have (A) neither voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and (B)
properly and validly exercised and perfected their respective statutory
rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be automatically
cancelled and no longer outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be
entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.10_. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment
of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting
Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who
have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section 2.15_ ) upon
surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided
in _Section 2.12_ and such shares of Company Common Stock shall not be
deemed to be Dissenting Company Shares. From and after the Effective Time,
Dissenting Company Shares shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be
entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions (except dividends
or other distributions payable to stockholders of record prior to the
Effective Time).

  



  

(ii)   _Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal_. The
Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to
settle, or make any payment with respect to, any such demands, approve any
withdrawal of any such demands or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

2.11   _Equity Awards._

  



  

(a)   _Company Options_. Parent will not assume any Company
Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the Merger Consideration (less the exercise price per share attributable to
such Company Option) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the "Option
Consideration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Company
Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Company
Options is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company
Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof. The payment of the Option Consideration will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes.

  



  

   

30

 

    



  

(b)   _Company Restricted Stock_. Parent will not assume any
Company Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock that, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, remains
subject to any performance-vest, time-vest or other condition(s) that
constitutes a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the meaning of Section
83 of the Code, which is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall become
fully vested as of the Effective Time. Each award of Company Restricted Stock
will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the amount of the Merger Consideration by (ii) the total
number of shares of Company Restricted Stock (the "Company Restricted Stock
Consideration").

  



  

(c)   _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent
will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Option Consideration owed to
all holders of Company Options; and (ii) Company Restricted Stock
Consideration owed to all holders of Company Restricted Stock. On the Closing
Date, the applicable holders of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock
will receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be
paid to such holders in respect of Company Restricted Stock or Company
Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section 2.11(a)_ or
_Section 2.11(b)_, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
payment owed to a holder of Company Options or Company Restricted Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.11(a)_ or _Section 2.11(b)_, as applicable, cannot
be made through the Company's or the Surviving Corporation's payroll system
or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for
such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to
such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than
five (5) Business Days thereafter).

  



  

(d)   _Necessary Further Actions_. The Company will take all
action necessary to effect the cancellation of Company Options and Company
Restricted Stock as of the Effective Time and to give effect to this _Section
2.11_ (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Subject to obtaining any
required consents from the holders thereof, all Company Equity Plans will
terminate as of the Effective Time.

  



  

   

31

 

    



  

2.12   _Exchange of Certificates._

  



  

(a)   _Depository Agent and Payment Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will select a bank or trust company mutually agreeable
to Parent and the Company to act as agent (the "Depository Agent") for the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Offer Price payable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and to act as the payment agent (the "Payment
Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.10._ Parent
shall enter into agreements reasonably acceptable to the Company with the
Depository Agent and Payment Agent, respectively, relating to services to be
performed by the Depository Agent in its capacity as Depository Agent and the
Payment Agent in its capacity as Payment Agent, respectively.

  



  

(b)   _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Depository Agent cash
sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant
to _Section 2.1(b)_ and with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.10_, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.10_, and Parent shall instruct the Payment
Agent to timely pay such amounts payable under _Section 2.10_ in accordance
with this Agreement (the amounts collectively deposited, the
"Exchange Fund"). Any interest and other income resulting from investments of
the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be
paid to Parent upon demand.

  



  

(c)  Exchange and Payment Procedures.

  



  

(i)   _Certificates_. Promptly following the Effective Time
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates") whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.10_, (A) a letter of
transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal") in customary form (which will specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof into
which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.10_. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or
agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent,
of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), for cancellation,
together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent
or such other agent or agents in accordance with the terms of such materials
and instructions, the holder of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number
of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by
(2) the Merger Consideration. The Certificate so surrendered will be
cancelled. The Payment Agent or such other agent or agents will accept
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Payment Agent or such other agent or agents may impose to cause an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Certificates on
the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this
_Section 2.12(c)(i)_. Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.10_.

  



  

   

32

 

    



  

(ii)   _Uncertificated Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock held
in book-entry form (the "Uncertificated Shares") will not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Payment
Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.10_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.10_ will,
upon receipt of an "agent's message" in customary form (it being understood
that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered
such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an "agent's message" or such other
evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the
Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holder's transferred Uncertificated
Shares by (B) the Merger Consideration. The Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent or such other agent or agents may impose to
cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder
of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.12(c)(ii)_. Until so
surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective
Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)_.

  



  

(d)   _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC
with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.,
Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Merger Consideration (such
amount, the "DTC Payment"); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m.,
Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the
DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date.

  



  

   

33

 

    



  

(e)   _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, then the consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.10_ may be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger
of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment
has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not applicable. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the
Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.12_ , each Certificate shall
be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the right
to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this _Article II_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any amount payable
upon surrender of any Certificate or in respect of Uncertificated Shares or on
the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f)   _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate of any of them or any other Party will be liable to a Company
Stockholder for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date
on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

  



  

(g)   _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the
Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ will thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to _Section
2.10_.

  



  

   

34

 

    



  

2.13   _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From
and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist;
and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration payable
therefor in accordance with _Section 2.10_ (or in the case of Dissenting
Company Shares, the rights pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_). The consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any
shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.
From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary
settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance
with the exchange procedures of _Section 2.12(c)_) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  



  

2.14   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.10_. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

2.15   _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any
applicable Laws relating to Taxes. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

  



  

2.16   _Future Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with
a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

  



  

2.17   _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and
officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

matters considered in connection with the preparation of such opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock

financial point of view. As of the date of this Agreement, such opinion has

there is no pending Legal Proceeding, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
Person has threatened in writing to commence any Legal Proceeding that
involves Parent, Merger Sub or their respective subsidiaries that would

(a)   _Financing Letters_. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of (i)
an executed commitment letter dated the date of this Agreement between Parent
and Borrowers (the "Equity Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which each of the
Borrowers has committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the cash amounts set forth therein
for the purpose of funding a portion of the Required Payments (the "Equity
Financing"); and (ii) an executed commitment letter dated the date of this
Agreement among Borrowers and the lenders party thereto (the "Debt Commitment
Letter" and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "Financing
Letters"), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein
for the purpose of funding a portion of the Required Payments (the "Debt
Financing" and, together with the Equity Financing, the "Financing"). As of
the date of this Agreement, Borrowers have also delivered to the Company a
true, correct and complete copy of each fee letter (which may be delivered
with the fee amounts and "flex" terms redacted in a customary manner so long
as no redaction covers terms that permit the imposition of additional
conditions precedent or the expansion of any existing conditions precedent to
the funding of the Debt Financing or the reduction of the aggregate principal
amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing) entered into by
Borrowers in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter (any such letter, a
"Fee Letter"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that (A) the Company is
an express third party beneficiary thereof in connection with the Company's
exercise of its rights under _Section 9.8(b)_; and (B) subject in all
respects to _Section 9.8(b)_, Parent and Borrowers have waived any defenses
to the enforceability of such third party beneficiary rights.

  



  

(b)   _No Amendments_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Financing Letters have not been amended or modified prior to the date of this
Agreement; (ii) other than amendments and modifications not prohibited by
_Section 6.4_ , no such amendment or modification is contemplated; and (iii)
the respective commitments contained therein have not been
withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended, supplemented or
modified in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no other
Contracts, agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent, each of
the Borrowers or Merger Sub is a party that contain any conditions precedent
to the funding or the investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters and the
Fee Letters.

  



  

   

61

 

    



  

(c)   _Sufficiency of Financing_. As of the date of this
Agreement and assuming that the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects
(without giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications set forth therein), Parent's cash on hand, together with the
proceeds of the Financing, is sufficient to enable Merger Sub to (i) make all
payments contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Offer and the
Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to Article II in
connection with or as a result of the Merger) required to be made by Merger
Sub at the Closing; (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving effect to
the Merger) the principal of and interest on, and all other indebtedness
outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreement; and (iii) pay all fees and
expenses in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the Financing required
to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at the Closing (the payments and
repayments described in clauses (i) through (iii), the "Required Payments").

  



  

(d)   _Validity_. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Financing Letters (in the forms delivered by Borrowers to the Company) are in
full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations
of Parent, Borrowers and, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of
Borrower, the other parties thereto, as applicable, enforceable against
Parent, Borrowers and, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of
Borrower, the other parties thereto, as applicable, in accordance with
their terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters, there are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full proceeds of the Financing pursuant to any agreement relating to the
Financing to which Parent, each of the Borrowers, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates is a party. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Parent, Borrowers nor, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of
Borrower, any counterparty to the Financing Letters has committed any breach
of any of its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default
under, any of the Financing Letters, in each case, that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in Parent and/or Borrowers being unable to
obtain the Financing on the terms or conditions set forth in the Financing
Letters and the Fee Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of Borrower, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent, Borrowers or, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge
of Borrower, any of the other parties thereto pursuant to the Financing
Letters that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in Borrowers
being unable to obtain the Financing on the terms or conditions set forth in
the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters. As of the date of this Agreement
and assuming that the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (without
giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications set forth therein), Parent and Borrowers have no reason to
believe (both before and after giving effect to any "flex" provisions in the
Debt Commitment Letter) that (A) Parent and/or Borrowers will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any condition precedent to the funding of the
Financing to be satisfied by them and within their control set forth in the
Financing Letters; or (B) the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing
Letters will not be available as of the Closing if the terms or conditions
contained in the Financing Letters to be satisfied by it are satisfied. As of
the date of this Agreement, Parent, Borrowers and Merger Sub have fully paid,
or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees that are due and
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of
the Financing Letters.

  



  

   

62

 

    



  

4.10   _Absence of Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. Except
for the Support Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract,
or has authorized, made or entered into, or committed or agreed to enter
into, any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings (whether
or not binding) with any stockholder, director, officer, employee or other
Affiliate of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (a) relating to
(i) this Agreement or the Merger; or (ii) the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing
employment) from and after the Effective Time; or (b) pursuant to which any
(A) holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled to receive consideration
of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration in respect of
such holder's shares of Company Common Stock; (B) holder of Company Common
Stock has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote against any Superior
Proposal; or (C) Person has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, an
equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion
of the Offer or the Merger _._

  



  

4.11   _Guarantee._ Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Guarantor has delivered to the Company the duly executed
Guarantee. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity. No event has occurred that
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would, or would reasonably
be expected to, constitute a default on the part of Guarantor pursuant to the
Guarantee.

  



  

4.12   _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties._

  



  

(a)   _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and
agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth
in Article III:

(iii)  the representations and warranties made by the Company in
this Agreement are in lieu of and are exclusive of all other representations
and warranties, including any express or implied or as to merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose, and the Company disclaims any other or
implied representations or warranties, notwithstanding the delivery or
disclosure to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives of any documentation or other information (including any
financial information, supplemental data or financial projections or other
forward-looking statements).

  



  

(b)   _No Reliance_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the

acting (including, as applicable, by entering into this Agreement or
consummating the Transactions) in reliance on:

  



  

(i)  any representation or warranty, express or implied;

Party and its Representatives if written notice has been provided to Parent
that discussions with such Excluded Party are continuing, which notice will

agreement, all non-public information furnished to such Person by or on

Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees),
in any such case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the
intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly
encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations,

constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition

Transaction, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); or (vi) authorize or
commit to do any of the foregoing. From the No-Shop Period Start Date until
the earlier to occur of (1) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII and (2) the Effective Time, the Company will not be required to
enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of any standstill or
confidentiality agreement to the extent that (x) such provision prohibits or
purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) and (y) the Company Board has determined that it
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law not to do so.

(d)   _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to contrary
in this _Section 5.3_, from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the

Proposal by, in each case, any Person or its Representatives that has made or
delivered to the Company a written Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop
Period Start Date that was not solicited in material breach of this _Section
5.3_, but only if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (B) the
failure to take the actions contemplated by this _Section 5.3(c)_ would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law.

contemporaneously (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to
Parent, or provide Parent and its Representatives access to, any non-
public information concerning the Company that is provided to any such Person
or its Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent. For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period
Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities described in
_Section 5.3(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Party, including with respect to
any amended proposal or offer submitted by an Excluded Party following the
No-Shop Period Start Date, and the restrictions in _Section 5.3(b)_ will not
apply with respect thereto if (x) the requirements set forth in clauses (A)
and (B) of this _Section 5.3(d)_  have been satisfied as of the No-Shop
Period Start date and (y) the Company has notified Parent of its intent to
continue such negotiations, which notice will contain the information
required by _Section 5.3(g)_.

an Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by _Section

Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; (B) adopt, approve,
endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
(C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten
(10) Business Days of the occurrence of a material event or development and
after Parent so requests in writing; or (D) take or fail to take any formal
action or make or fail to make any recommendation in connection with a tender
or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop,
look and listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from
taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until 5:30 p.m.,
Eastern time, on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of a
tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without
such action being considered a violation of this _Section 5.3_) (any action
described in clauses (A) through (D), a "Company Board Recommendation
Change"), it being understood that none of (1) the determination in itself by
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; (2) the
delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by
_Section 5.3(f)_; or (3) the public disclosure in itself of the items in
clauses (1) and (2) if required by applicable Law will constitute a Company
Board Recommendation Change or violate this _Section 5.3_; or

  



  

(ii)  cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

(f)   _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into
Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time:

  



  

(i)  other than in connection with a written Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law if and only if:

  



  

(1)  the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at
least three (3) Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.3(f)(i)(1)_,
which notice will specify the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

  



  

(2)  prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company and its Representatives, until 5:00 p.m., Eastern time,
at the end of such three (3) Business Day period, have (A) negotiated with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) no longer
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law; and (B) permitted Parent and its
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent
requests to make such a presentation); or

  



  

   

71

 

    



  

(ii)  if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) is a Superior Proposal and which did not result from any breach of
this _Section 5.3_ , then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B)
authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_ to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, in each case if and only if:

  



  

(1)  the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;

  



  

(2)  the Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; and

  



  

(3)  (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent
at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") which
notice shall state that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A)
received a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that has not been
withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_ , which notice will specify the reasons for such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or
Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal and include copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its
Representatives, until 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the last day of the Notice
Period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith
(to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to enable the Company Board to
not make a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_ ; and (2) permitted Parent and its
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to
the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being
understood that (a) in the event of any material revision, amendment, update
or supplement to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 5.3(f)(ii)(3)_ with respect to such new written notice (with
the "Notice Period" in respect of such new written notice being two (2)
Business Days); and (b) at the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) must have in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the applicable Acquisition
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal. The parties agree that if the
Notice Period (or any new five (5) Business Day period) ends on a date that
is concurrent with, or later than, the date of the Expiration Date, at its
election Merger Sub may, or at the written request of the Company Board,
Merger Sub shall, extend the Offer until one (1) minute after 11:59 p.m. (New
York City time) on the date that is the later of (x) two (2) Business Days
following the last day of the applicable Notice Period (or any new five (5)
Business Day period) or (y) the last day of the minimum period required
by applicable Law, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or the
NYSE or its staff for any such extension.

Start Date, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four
(24) hours from the receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if any
Acquisition Proposal, or Inquiry including any request for non-public
information or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or

Representatives and the terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal,
including, if applicable, providing copies of any written Inquiries and any
proposed agreements related thereto. Such notice must include (A) the
identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry;
and (B) a summary of the material terms and conditions of any such

Parent in writing (i) if the Company determines to begin providing non-
public information or to engage in negotiations or discussions concerning an
Acquisition Proposal in accordance with this _Section 5.3_  and (ii)
thereafter of any change to the financial and other material terms and
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal, and (y) otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such Inquiry,
Acquisition Proposal, discussions or negotiations, including by providing a
copy of all proposals, offers or drafts of proposed agreements. The Company
shall not, after the No-Shop Period Start Date, enter into any
confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from
providing such information to Parent.

  



  

(h)   _Permitted Disclosures_. So long as the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in
such disclosure (other than in a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act):

  



  

(i)  nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to
the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, including making a "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially
similar communication), _provided_ that any such disclosure does not
contain an express Company Board Recommendation Change; (B) complying with
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (C)
informing any Person (or the Representatives of such Person) that makes any
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry to the extent necessary to direct such Person

disclosure to the Company Stockholders (including regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company) that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof), after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 5.3(h)_ , any disclosure made as permitted under clause (i) of this
_Section 5.3(h)_ (other than any "stop-look-and-listen" or similar
communication) that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in connection with such
disclosure, and (y) neither the Company nor the Company Board (nor any
committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend any Acquisition Proposal
(including that the stockholders of the Company tender any securities in
connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is an
Acquisition Proposal) or otherwise effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change with respect thereto, except as permitted by _Section 5.3_ ; and

  



  

   

73

receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; (B) identifies the Person or Group making
such Acquisition Proposal; (C) provides the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal; or (D) describes the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto will not, in any case, be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation
Change;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall not make any
Company Board Recommendation Change except in accordance with _Section
5.3(f)_.

  



  

(i)   _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that if
it (i) permits any of its Representatives (other than an employee or
consultant of the Company who is not an executive officer of the Company) to
take any action or (ii) is made aware of an action by one of its
Representatives (other than an employee or consultant of the Company who is
not an executive officer of the Company) and does not use its reasonable best
efforts to prohibit or terminate such action and, in each case, such action
would constitute a material breach of this _Section 5.3_ if taken by the
Company, then such action will be deemed to constitute a breach by the
Company of this _Section 5.3_.

  



  

5.4   _No Control of the Other Party 's Business_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are
not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on

the Merger.

  



  

(b)   _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the
foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, neither
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand,
will take any action (or fail to take any action) that is intended to or has
(or would reasonably be expected to have) the effect of preventing, impairing,
delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the (i) consummation of the Merger;
or (ii) ability of such Party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in
compliance with _Section 5.3_ will be considered a violation of this
_Section 6.1_.

  



  

(c)   _No Consent Fee_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section 6.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries will be required to agree to the
payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration
(including increased or accelerated payments), or the provision of additional
security (including a guaranty), in connection with the Merger, including in
connection with obtaining any consent pursuant to any Material Contract.

  



  

6.2   _Antitrust Filings._

  



  

(a)   _Filings Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Antitrust
Laws_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates, if
applicable), on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, file (i) a Notification and Report Form relating
to this Agreement and the Merger as required by the HSR Act with the FTC and
the Antitrust Division of the DOJ; and (ii) comparable pre-merger or post-
merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any Governmental

Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will (A) cooperate and coordinate (and

the other in the making of such filings; (B) use its respective reasonable
best efforts to supply the other (or cause the other to be supplied) any
information that may be required in order to make such filings; (C) use its

supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or
requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the Governmental Authorities of any other
applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made; and (D) use its
respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to, as soon as
practicable, (1) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Merger; and (2) obtain any required consents pursuant to
any Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger. If any Party receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger, then such Party will make (or cause
to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with
the other Parties, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

(b)   _Divestitures_. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the
Merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the
Merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable) will offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting
interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or
businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand; and (ii) any
other restrictions on the activities of Parent and Merger Sub (and their
respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand. Except as specifically set forth above, Parent and Merger Sub
shall not be required to contest, defend and appeal any Legal Proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(c)   _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will (and will cause their
respective Subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Law,
(i) promptly notify the other Parties of (and, if in writing, furnish them
with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise them of the
contents of)) any material communication received by such Person from a
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and permit the other
Parties to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed draft
notifications, formal notifications, filings, submissions or other written
communications (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations,
correspondence or other documents submitted therewith) made in connection with
the Merger to a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties
reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such submissions and
filings to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect thereof, including with respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action,
action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver; (B) the expiration of any
waiting period; (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement
of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or
proceeding under applicable Law; and (D) the nature and status of any
objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger; and (iii) not independently participate
in any meeting, hearing, proceeding or discussions with or before
any Governmental Authority in respect of the Merger without giving the other
Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting, hearing, proceeding or
discussion, and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub may designate any non-public information provided to any
Governmental Authority as restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such
information will not be shared with the Representatives of the other Party
without approval of the Party providing the non-public information. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may redact any valuation and related
information before sharing any information provided to any Governmental
Authority with another Party on an "outside counsel" only basis.

6.3   _Other Required SEC Filings._

  



  

(a)   _SEC Correspondence_. The Parties will notify each other
as promptly as practicable of the receipt of any comments, whether written or
oral, from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements
to any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, or
for additional information, and will supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to such filings. The Parties will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments, if
any, with respect to the Offer, if any, as promptly as practicable after the
receipt thereof.

  



  

(b)   _Other Required Company Filings_. If the Company
determines that it is required to file any document with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"), then the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such
Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any Other Required Company Filing to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the NYSE. Except in
connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or thereafter, the
Company may not file any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without
first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, and the Company will give good faith consideration to all
reasonable and timely additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent or
its counsel.

  



  

(c)   _Other Required Parent Filings_. If Parent or Merger Sub
determines that it is required to file any document with the SEC as a result
of the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (an "Other Required Parent Filing"),
then Parent and Merger Sub will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC.
Parent and Merger Sub will cause any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as

counsel.

6.4   _Financing._

  



  

(a)   _No Amendments to the Debt Commitment Letter_. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Borrowers will not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision of or
remedy pursuant to, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification
or waiver would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate committed
amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that, when taken together with the
aggregate amount of the Equity Financing (after giving effect to any increases
thereto) and Parent's cash on hand, would not be sufficient to make the
Required Payments at the Closing; (ii) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the existing conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letters, in each
case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent
the consummation of the Closing; or (B) make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing, less likely to occur; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of
Borrowers to enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter in any material respect. Any reference in this Agreement to
(1) the "Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as amended or modified in compliance with this _Section
6.4_; and (2) "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Financing Letters" will include
such documents as amended or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.4_.
Borrowers will not release or consent to the termination of any individual
lender under the Debt Commitment Letter, except for replacements of the Debt
Commitment Letter with alternative financing commitments pursuant to _Section
6.4(d)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and for
the avoidance of doubt, Borrowers, without the written consent of the
Company, amend, restate, amend and restate, supplement or otherwise modify the
Debt Commitment Letter to (x) provide for the assignment of any portion of
the commitments or obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter to additional
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, or similar entities
(including any private placement parties or replacement lenders) that have
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement and
to grant to such persons such approval rights as are customarily granted to
such additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities, or to reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or
roles to or between or among any entities party to the Debt Commitment
Letter, and/or (y) to correct typographical errors.

  



  

(b)   _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the Borrowers will use reasonable best
efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and to do (or cause to be
done) all things necessary, proper and advisable (as determined by Borrowers
in their reasonable judgment) to arrange and obtain at the Closing the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the
full valid exercise of any "flex" provisions) described in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters, including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the
terms and conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate and, on the Closing Date, execute
and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and subject to the
conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters or on such other terms and subject to
such other conditions that (x) would not directly reduce the aggregate amount
of the Debt Financing to an amount, when taken together with the aggregate
amount of the Equity Financing (after giving effect to any increases thereto)
and Parent's cash on hand, that would not be sufficient to make the Required
Payments at the Closing and (y) in respect of certainty of funding, would not
reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the consummation of the Closing
(other than for up to two (2) Business Days) or (B) make the timely funding
of the Debt Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Debt Financing, less likely to occur; (iii) satisfy at or prior to the Closing
all conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing that are to be satisfied
by Parent and within its control set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters; and
(v) in the event all conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt
Financing have been satisfied, consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Closing, including causing the Financing Sources to fund the Financing at the
Closing; (vi) comply with its obligations pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter; and (vii) enforce its rights pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

   

78

 

    



  

(c)   _Information_. To the extent reasonably requested from
time to time by the Company, Borrowers shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Borrowers shall give the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach
(or threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to
give rise to a breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter
of which Borrowers become aware if as a result thereof it is reasonably
likely that Borrowers will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter and Fee Letters; (B) of the receipt by Borrowers of any oral or
written notice or communication from any Financing Source with respect to any
(1) actual or potential breach (or threatened breach), default, early
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of any
provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter; or (2) dispute or disagreement
between or among Borrowers, on the one hand, and the Financing Sources, on the
other hand, with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the
amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing, if, in the case of
each of clauses (1) and (2), as a result thereof it is reasonably likely that
Borrowers will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Fee Letters; and (C) if for any reason Borrowers at any time reasonably
believe that they will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter. Borrowers shall provide the Company with any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the
circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably
practical (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the date that
the Company delivers a written request therefor to Borrowers; _provided_
that, in no event shall Borrowers be under any obligation to deliver or
disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to waive the
protection of attorney-client protection or similar privilege. Borrowers must
use commercially reasonable efforts to (and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Financing Sources to) provide the Company and its
Representatives with such access to the Financing Sources as the Company and
its Representatives may reasonably request for the purpose of allowing the
Company and its Representatives to understand the status of Borrowers'
efforts to arrange the Financing; provided that in no event shall the
Financing Sources be obligated to provide the Company and its Representatives
any such access.

  



  

   

79

 

    



  

(d)   _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the
"flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letters, then Parent and Borrowers will use reasonable best efforts to
arrange, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, to
obtain (i) alternative financing from alternative sources that is subject to
conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and
Borrowers than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letters and in an amount that, when taken together with the aggregate amount
of the portion of the Debt Financing that remains available to Borrowers would
be sufficient to make the Required Payments at the Closing (the "Alternate
Debt Financing"); and (ii) one or more new financing commitment letters with
respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the "New Debt Commitment Letters"),
which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment
Letter in whole or in part. Parent and/or Borrowers will promptly provide a
copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter (which may be
delivered with the fee amounts and "flex" terms redacted in a customary
manner so long as no redaction covers terms that would permit the
imposition of additional conditions precedent or the expansion of any
existing conditions precedent to the funding of the Alternate Debt
Financing or the reduction of the aggregate principal amount of the Alternate
Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing) entered into by Parent, Borrowers
or Merger Sub in connection with such New Debt Commitment Letters) to the
Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A)
any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Letters" or the "Debt
Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to
the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in
question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect; and
(B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt
Financing" will mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

  



  

(e)   _Enforcement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this  _Section 6.4_ will
require, and in no event will reasonable best efforts be deemed or construed
to require, either of the Borrowers to (i) pay any fees or agree to any
interest rates in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Fee Letters, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof; or
(ii) agree to conditionality or economic terms of the Debt Financing that are
less favorable in the aggregate than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Fee Letters, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof.

  



  

6.5   _Financing Cooperation._

  



  

(a)   _Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will use reasonable best efforts, and will cause each its officers,
employees, advisors and other Representatives to use reasonable best efforts,

Parent or Merger Sub to assist them in causing the conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letter to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with Parent and Merger Sub obtaining the
Debt Financing by:

the one hand, and the actual and potential Financing Sources, on the other
hand);

  



  

(ii)  assisting Parent and the Financing Sources with the timely
preparation of customary rating agency presentations, bank information

or assistance relating to (A) the proposed aggregate amount of debt and
equity financing, together with assumed interest rates, dividends (if
any) and fees and expenses relating to the incurrence of such debt or equity
financing; (B) any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization, ownership or other pro forma adjustments desired to be

Subsidiaries or any adjustments that are not directly related to the
acquisition of the Company by Parent;

registration of (but not executing, to the extent any such documents or
arrangements would be effective prior to the Closing, other than any
authorization letters described in _Section 6.5(a)(viii)_ ) any pledge and

arrangements and other definitive financing agreements or documents
(including any related schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto) as may be

reasonable best efforts to obtain, to the extent applicable, consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing and accountants' comfort letters, in each case as reasonably
requested by Parent), and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral and the granting of security interests in respect of the Debt
Financing, it being understood that such documents will not be recorded or

information regarding the business, operations and financial projections
thereof) as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist in

any portion of the Debt Financing, including any "description of notes"; (3)
risk factors relating to all or any component of the Debt Financing; (4)

10-K or any other information customarily excluded from an offering

pursuant to Rule 144A) or otherwise necessary to receive from the Company's
independent accountants (and any other accountant to the extent that
financial statements audited or reviewed by such accountants are or would be
included in such offering memorandum) to the extent customary for a financing

Debt Financing, with respect to the financial information to be included in
such offering memorandum (all such information and documents in this _Section
6.5(a)(v)_, the "Required Financing Information"), it being understood that
if the Company reasonably believes that it has previously provided any of the
Required Financing Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice
stating when it believes that it completed such delivery, in which case the
Company will be deemed to have complied with this _Section 6.5(a)(v)_ unless
Parent reasonably believes the Company has not completed the delivery of the
Required Financing Information and, within two (2) Business Days after
receipt of such notice from the Company, delivers a written notice to the
Company to that effect (stating with specificity what Required Financing
Information the Company has not delivered), in which case the Company and
Parent shall in good faith discuss and work to resolve the status of such
Required Financing Information;

  



  

(vi)  cooperating with Parent to obtain customary and reasonable
corporate and facilities consents, landlord waivers, non-
invasive environmental assessments, surveys and title insurance as reasonably
requested by Parent in order to comply with the reasonable requirements of

(ix)  taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the

Debt Financing, if any, obtained by any of the Subsidiaries of the Company to
the Surviving Corporation); and

  



  

(x)  furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing with (A) all documentation and other
information about the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably
requested by Parent at least seven (7) Business Days prior to Closing, in

Parent has requested at least seven (7) Business Days prior to Closing.

  



  

(b)   _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this _Section
6.5_ will require the Company to (i) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement by or on
behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into any definitive agreement relating to the
Debt Financing (other than customary representation letters and authorization
letters (including with respect to the presence or absence of material non-
public information about the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the
accuracy in all material respects of the information contained in the
disclosure and marketing materials related to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries)) that is effective prior to the Effective Time; (iii) give any
indemnities in connection with the Debt Financing that are effective prior to
the Effective Time; or (iv) take any action that, in the good faith
determination of the Company, (a) would unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company or (b) create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company. In addition, (A) no
action, liability or obligation of the Company or any of its
Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document
or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other than
customary representation letters and authorization letters (including with
respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information about
the Company and the accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure
and marketing materials related to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries))
will be effective until the Effective Time; (B) the Company will not be
required to take any action pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument (other than customary representation
letters and authorization letters (including with respect to the presence or
absence of material non-public information about the Company and the accuracy
of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)) that is not contingent on the
occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective
Time; and (C) any bank information memoranda and high-yield offering
prospectuses or memoranda required in relation to the Debt Financing will
contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this _Section
6.5_ will require (1) any Representative of the Company to deliver any
certificate or opinion or take any other action under this _Section 6.5_
that would reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to
such Representative; (2) the Company Board to approve any financing or
Contracts related thereto; (3) the Company to take any action that would
conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable Laws;
and (4) the Company to provide any information (a) the disclosure of which
(as determined by the Company in good faith) is prohibited or
restricted under applicable Law or any agreement binding on the Company as of
the date of this Agreement or any agreement binding on the Company that is
entered into after the date of this Agreement that is not entered into for the
purpose of evading the obligations in this  _Section 6.5_ ; or (b) where
access to such information would (as determined by the Company in good faith)
(i) give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such information; or
(ii) violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right
terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, any Contract to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound;
_provided_ that in the event the Company does not disclose any such
information in reliance on the foregoing subclause (4), the Company shall
inform Parent thereof and of the general nature of the information being
withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_, as it applies to the Company's
obligations under _Section 6.5(a)_, will be deemed to be satisfied so long
as the Company's breach, if any, of its obligations under _Section
6.5(a)_ did not cause the failure of the Debt Financing to be obtained.

  



  

   

83

 

    



  

(c)   _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of
its logos in connection with the Financing so long as such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or would not reasonably be expected
to harm or disparage the Company or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company.

  



  

(d)   _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential
information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives to Parent
or Merger Sub or their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement
will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such
information to any Financing Sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, bookrunners, arrangers, initial
purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in
each case, to their respective Representatives).

  



  

(e)   _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company,
Parent will reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
the Company in connection with the cooperation of the Company contemplated by
this _Section 6.5;_ _provided_ that the Company, and not Parent, shall be
responsible for any amounts that would have been incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby regardless of the Debt Financing
(including the preparation and/or delivery of financial information, payoff
letters and lien releases).

  



  

   

84

 

    



  

(f)   _Indemnification_. The Company and its Representatives
will be indemnified and held harmless by Parent from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation
in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision
of information utilized in connection therewith, other than to the extent any
of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence
or intentional fraud of the Company or any of its Representatives. Parent's
obligations pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)_ and this _Section 6.5(f)_ are
referred to collectively as the "Reimbursement Obligations."

  



  

(g)   _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will
be deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub and the
Financing Sources or potential financing sources of Parent, Merger Sub and
such investors) enter into any Contract (i) awarding any agent, broker,
investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an
exclusive basis; or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank,
investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing from
providing or seeking to provide debt or equity financing or financial
advisory services to any Person, in each case in connection with a transaction
relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or in connection
with the Merger.

  



  

(h)   _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the
Closing. Subject to _Section 9.8(b)(ii)_, if the Financing has not been
obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to
consummate the Merger.

  



  

6.6   _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board
will (a) take all actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-
takeover" Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any "anti-
takeover" Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, take all action within
their power to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger.

  



  

6.7   _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and
(2) Effective Time, the Company will afford Parent and its Representatives
(including the Financing Sources and their respective Representatives)
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any
applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access
to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a
default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate
the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d) access would result in the
disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third Persons; or (e) such documents or
information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between
the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its
Affiliates, on the other hand. Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ will be
construed to require the Company or any of its Representatives to prepare any
reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.7_ will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company or create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company. Any access to the
properties of the Company will be subject to the Company's reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right
to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its
Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section 6.7_. All requests for access pursuant
to this _Section 6.7_ must be directed to the Company's Chief Executive
Officer or another person designated in writing by the Company.

  



  

   

85

 

    



  

6.8   _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company will take all
actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive
officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

  



  

6.9   _Directors ' and Officers' Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance._

  



  

(a)   _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter,
the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries, and any indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of
this Agreement as set forth in _Section 3.9(a)(ix)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter between the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers or
employees (and any person who becomes a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on
the other hand (collectively, and whether or not they are parties to any such
indemnification agreements, the "Indemnified Persons") with respect to any
Legal Proceeding in which such Indemnified Person may be involved or with
which he or she may be threatened (an "Indemnified Person Proceeding") (A) by
reason of such Indemnified Person's being or having been such director or
officer or an employee or agent of any Acquired Entity or otherwise in
connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of any Acquired
Entity or (B) arising out of such Indemnified Person's service in
connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she
serves or has served as director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary at the request of any Acquired Entity. In addition, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter,
the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.
During such six-year period or such period in which an Indemnified Person is
asserting a claim for advancement or indemnification pursuant to _Section
6.9(b)_ , whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended
or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

  



  

   

86

 

    



  

(b)   _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the
generality of _Section 6.9(a)_, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation each will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, pursuant to any indemnification agreements with
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective
Time as set forth in _Section 3.9(a)(ix)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and pursuant to the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational
documents of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time, as
applicable, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, including Transaction
Litigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the
extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or
pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, in such Indemnified Person's capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates; and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any
disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person
delivers to Parent or the Surviving Corporation a written notice asserting a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.9(b)_, then the claim
asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In connection with such
Legal Proceeding of the type contemplated by this _Section 6.9(b)_, (A) upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay
any amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance all fees and expenses (including
fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the
defense of such Legal Proceeding; and (B) no Indemnified Person will be
liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or
her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary
damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible) which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to,
or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination releases
such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Legal
Proceeding. Indemnified Persons and Surviving Corporation will (and Parent
shall cause Surviving Corporation to) reasonably cooperate in good faith in
the defense of any such matters. Parent shall guarantee the obligations of
the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.9(b)_.

  



  

   

87

 

    



  

(c)   _D andO Insurance_. The Company has purchased a prepaid
"tail" policy (the "Tail Policy") providing coverage for Indemnified Persons
on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current DandO Insurance carrier for an aggregate
period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the
Transactions. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as the
Tail Policy is in full force and effect.

  



  

(d)   _Successors and Assigns_. Proper provisions will be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
_Section 6.9_ if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person.

  



  

(e)   _No Impairment; Third Person Beneficiary Rights_. The
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_ may not be terminated, amended
or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified
Person (or any other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is
a beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy) without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and
representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the
Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
6.9_, with full rights of enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons
(and other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are
beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to
this _Section 6.9_ will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and
Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law.

  



  

(f)   _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors'
and officers' insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement as set forth in _Section 3.9(a)(ix)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.9_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

  



  

   

88

 

    



  

6.10   _Employee Matters._

  



  

(a)   _Benefits_. The Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of
its Subsidiaries to) for a period of one year following the Effective Time (or
if earlier, until the date of the employee's termination of employment with
Parent), provide compensation and benefits (other than the opportunity to
participate in equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) to
each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than the
opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and individual employment
agreements) provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent.

  



  

(b)   _New Plans_. With respect to each health or welfare
benefit plan made available by the Parent to any Continuing Employee at or
after the Effective Time (each, a "Parent Plan"), the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing
Employee credit for all service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement),
except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits or with respect to any defined
benefit pension plan. In addition, for purposes of each Parent Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other
welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing
conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such
Parent Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and the Surviving Corporation will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the comparable Company Benefit Plan ending on the date that such
Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding Parent Plan begins
to be given full credit pursuant to such Parent Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such Parent Plan.

  



  

(c)   _No Third Person Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither this _Section
6.10_ nor any provisions of this Agreement relating to Company Benefit Plans
will be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason;
(ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in
this _Section 6.10_, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Benefit Plan or prevent
the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time;
(iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) be
treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit
Plan.

  



  

   

89

 

    



  

(d)   _401(k) Plan Termination_. Upon written request by Parent
at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
adopt resolutions terminating the Company 401(k) Plan, effective as of one day
preceding the Closing Date, but contingent on the occurrence of the Closing.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent evidence that each
Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated pursuant to duly adopted resolutions,
and that all other actions necessary to implement the foregoing have been
taken at least one day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of
any such resolutions and any related documentation, including participant
notifications (if applicable), shall be subject to review and reasonable
approval of Parent and shall be provided to Parent at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

6.11   _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by
either of them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants,
agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

6.12   _Notification of Certain Matters._

  



  

(a)   _Notification by the Company_. At all times during the
period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and (2) Effective Time, the Company will give prompt
notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made
by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the
extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ or
clause (c) of _Exhibit A_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing. No such
notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the
remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement; _provided_  that the
failure to notify Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.12(a)_ shall not
constitute a breach of covenant in any material respect for purposes of
clause (c) of _Exhibit A_ or give rise to any right of termination under
Article VIII. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply
to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.12(a)_.

  



  

   

90

 

    



  

(b)   _Notification by Parent_. At all times during the period
commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article VIII and (2) Effective Time, Parent will give prompt notice to the
Company upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by
Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if
and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of
the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or
_Section 7.3(b)_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing. No such notification
will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent
or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations
of the Company to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the
Parties under this Agreement; _provided_ that the failure to notify the
Company pursuant to this _Section 6.12(b)_ shall not give rise to any right
of termination under Article VIII. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to the Company
pursuant to this _Section 6.12(b)_.

  



  

6.13   _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release
concerning this Agreement and the Merger will be a joint press release
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent and will be issued promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Thereafter, the
Company (unless the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has made a Company
Board Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b)
engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or
other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are
reasonably likely to become public, in each case to the extent relating to
this Agreement or the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will
not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications
that are (i) required by applicable Law; (ii) principally directed to
employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors so long as such
communications are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or
individually if approved by the other Party); or (iii) principally related to
a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein shall restrict
Parent or the Financing Sources or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives from making customary announcements and communications in
connection with the consummation of the Debt Financing.

  



  

6.14   _Transaction Litigation_. At all times during the period
commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article VIII and (2) Effective Time, the Company will provide Parent with
prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation commenced or, to the Knowledge of
the Company or Parent, threatened (including by providing copies of all
pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
_Section 9.2_, the notice contemplated by the prior sentence will only be
delivered to counsel to Parent and may be delivered by email. The
Company will (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense,
settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; (b) consult with
Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation; and (c) consider in good faith Parent's advice with
respect to any Transaction Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle
or come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come
to an arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has
consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Without otherwise limiting the Indemnified Persons'
rights with regard to the right to counsel, following the Effective Time, the
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to continue to retain Goodwin Procter
LLP or such other counsel selected by such Indemnified Persons prior to the
Effective Time to defend any Transaction Litigation. For purposes of this
_Section 6.14_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client
privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with
respect to such Transaction Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-
making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for
the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

  



  

   

91

 

    



  

6.15   _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
pursuant to applicable Law to cause (a) the delisting of the Company Common
Stock from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time; and
(b) the deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

  



  

6.16   _Additional Agreements_. If at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors of each
Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action.

  



  

6.17   _Parent Vote at Merger Sub_. Immediately following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, will execute and deliver to Merger Sub (with a copy
also sent to the Company) a written consent adopting this Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

6.18   _Conduct of Business by Parent and Merger Sub._ From the date
of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and (2) Effective Time, unless the Company
otherwise consents, Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will not cause any of
their Affiliates (including the Guarantor) to:

  



  

(a)  acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating
with, by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by acquiring
in any other manner, any business of any Person or other business organization
or division thereof if such business competes in any line of business of the
Company and the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such transaction could reasonably be expected to (i) impose
any delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger; (iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise; or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger;

  



  

   

92

 

    



  

(b)  enter or agree to enter into any definitive agreement (i)
for the acquisition of any business or Person or take or agree to take any
other action that, in either case, would reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with their ability to consummate the Merger; or (ii) that otherwise
would be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the consummation of
the Merger; or

  



  

(c)  take or agree to take any other action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

6.19   _Credit Agreement_. The Company will have delivered to Parent,
by no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, a customary
payoff letter (the "Payoff Letter") in connection with the repayment of all
outstanding Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, which Payoff Letter will
provide for, among other customary items (and subject to receipt of the
applicable payoff amount), customary lien and guarantee releases. At the
Closing, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ , Parent will provide (or cause to be provided) to the
Company funds in an amount equal to the amount necessary for the Company to
repay and discharge in full all amounts outstanding under the terms of the
Credit Agreement in accordance with the Payoff Letter and the terms hereof.
Substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, the Company will repay
and discharge such Indebtedness in accordance with the Payoff Letter and the
terms hereof.

non-appealable; or (ii) Law is enacted, entered, enforced or deemed
applicable to the Offer or the Merger that prohibits, makes illegal
or enjoins the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, except, in each case,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_

efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent pursuant to, resolve or lift, as
applicable, such injunction, judgment, order, restraint, prohibition,
action or Law;

  



  

(c)  by either Parent or the Company, upon prior written notice

those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each
of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or waived (where

Parent if the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(g)_; and (ii) any Party whose action or failure to act (which

to consummate the Merger set forth in Article VII prior to the Termination
Date; or (B) the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred prior to the
Termination Date;

  



  

(d)  by either Parent or the Company, upon prior written notice
to the other, if (i) the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before

of its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of the
event specified in either of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii);

  



  

(e)  by Parent, upon prior written notice to the Company, if the
Company has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_, except that if
such breach or failure to perform is capable of being cured by the Termination
Date, Parent will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement prior to the
delivery by Parent to the Company of written notice of such breach or failure
to perform, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination,
stating Parent's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

Parent will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement if such breach or
failure to perform has been cured prior to termination; _provided_ , that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(e)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of any of their
respective representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement so as
to cause the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_ not to
be satisfied;

  



  

   

96

 

    



  

(f)  by Parent, upon prior written notice to the Company, if at

Board Recommendation Change;

  



  

(g)  by the Company, upon prior written notice to Parent, if

respect any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other

would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ or
_Section 7.3,_ except that if such breach or failure to perform is capable
of being cured by the Termination Date, the Company will not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement prior to the delivery by the Company to Parent of
written notice of such breach or failure to perform, delivered at least
thirty (30) days prior to such termination, stating the Company's intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ and the basis for
such termination, it being understood that the Company will not be entitled
to terminate this Agreement if such breach or failure to perform has been
cured prior to termination; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ if the
Company is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants under this Agreement so as to cause the conditions set forth in

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the date upon

97

 

    



  

8.2   _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination._

  



  

(a)   _Manner of Termination_. The Party terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ (other than pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)_) must deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties
setting forth in reasonable detail the provision of _Section 8.1_ pursuant
to which this Agreement is being terminated and the facts and
circumstances forming the basis for such termination.

  



  

(b)   _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ will be effective immediately
upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of
written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. Following the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement will
be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any equity
holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director,
officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party) to
the other Parties, as applicable, except, and subject in all respects to this
_Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.14_, that
_Section 6.5(c)_, _Section 6.5(f)_, _Section 6.13_, this _Section 8.2_, 
_Section 8.3_, _Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5_ and _Article IX_ will each
survive the termination of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with
their respective terms. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, but subject
to  _Section 8.3(f)_ , nothing in this Agreement will relieve (i) any Party
from any liability for any Willful Breach of this Agreement; and (ii) the
Company or (subject in all respects to this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_,
_Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.14_) Parent or Merger Sub from any liability
for its fraud prior to the valid termination of this Agreement;  _provided_ ,
that other than in the case of an equitable remedy of specific performance in
accordance with _Section 9.8(b)_ , in no event shall the Parent or Merger
Sub's liability for a Willful Breach exceed the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee and in no event shall the Company's liability for a Willful
Breach exceed the amount of the Company Termination Fee. No valid termination
of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant
to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guarantee or the Financing Letters,
which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Willful Breach" means a material breach of this Agreement
that is the consequence of an act or omission by a Party with the actual
knowledge or intention that the taking of such act or omission would
constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

8.3   _Fees and Expenses._

  



  

(a)   _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer and
the Merger will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the
Payment Agent and all filing fees in connection with any filings required by
the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. Except as set
forth in _Section 2.12(e)_, Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i)
transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real
property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out
of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger.

  



  

   

98

 

    



  

(b)  Company Payments.

  



  

(i)   _Future Transactions_. If (A) this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_; (B) at the
time of such termination, the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and
_Section 7.1(c)_ have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ would be
satisfied if the date of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_, as
applicable, an Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction has been
publicly announced or publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise
abandoned that contemplates a per share price for the acquisition of the
shares of the Company Common Stock that is higher than the Merger
Consideration; and (D) within one year of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_, as applicable, either an
Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition
Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated,
then the Company will, concurrently with the consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an
amount equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. For
purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(i)_, all references to "20%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be references to
"50%."

  



  

(ii)   _Company Board Recommendation Change_. If this Agreement
is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, then the Company must
within two (2) Business Days following such termination pay or cause to be
paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent.

  



  

(iii)   _Superior Proposal_. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_, then the Company must concurrently
with such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

  



  

(c)   _Parent Payment_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ or _Section 8.1(i)_ , then Parent must within
two (2) Business Days following such termination pay or cause to be paid to
the Company or its designee an amount equal to $11,055,000.00 (the "Parent
Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by the Company.

  



  

(d)   _Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company or Parent be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination
Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to
more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times
and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages
resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is payable are
uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as
and when required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ will not
constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the circumstances in
which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

   

99

 

    



  

(e)   _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of
the Merger and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay
any amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company
for the amount set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_ or any portion thereof or a
judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section 8.3(c)_ or any
portion thereof, as applicable, then the non-paying party will pay or cause
to be paid to the other party the reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) of the other party in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together
with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the
prime rate (as published in  _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made) plus 5%
through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received,
or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(f)  Sole and Exclusive Remedy.

  



  

(i)   _Company_. The Company's receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ (including,
without duplication, the Company's right to enforce the Guarantee with respect
thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee from Guarantor), Reimbursement
Obligations and the Company's right to specific performance pursuant to
_Section 9.8_ will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company against
(A) Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor, and (B) the former, current and future

Representatives, Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub
or Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited partners,

Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") in
respect of this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Guarantee, and the
Transactions and by such agreements, and upon payment of such amounts, none
of the Parent Related Parties will have any further monetary liability or
obligation to the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing Letters, the Guarantee or the Transactions and by such agreements,
except that (1) Parent and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates) will remain
obligated with respect to, and the Acquired Entities may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 8.2_ ,
_Section 8.3(a)_  and _Section 8.3(e)_ ; and (2) the Guarantor will remain
obligated, and the Company may be entitled to remedies, with respect to the
Guarantee.

  



  

   

100

 

    



  

(ii)   _Parent_. Parent's receipt of the Company Termination Fee
to the extent owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and Parent's right to
specific performance pursuant to _Section 9.8_ will be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Parent and Merger Sub against (A) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, financing sources,
Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders and assignees of each of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and each of their respective Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B)
collectively, the "Company Related Parties") in respect of this Agreement and
the Merger, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related
Parties will have any further monetary liability or obligation to Parent or
Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger, except
that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or their Affiliates) will
remain obligated with respect to, and Parent and Merger Sub may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section
8.2_ , _Section 8.3(a)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_ , as applicable.

  



  

(g)   _Maximum Liability Amount_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, but subject
to _Section 9.8(b)_, the maximum aggregate liability, whether in equity or at
Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise, together with any payment of the
Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee and any other payment in
connection with any Transaction Document or otherwise, of any Related Party
for any Willful Breach (A) under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document; (B) in connection with the failure of the Merger (including the
Financing) or the other transactions contemplated hereunder or under the
Transaction Documents to be consummated; or (C) in respect of any
representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in connection
with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, will not exceed under

Breach, plus the reimbursement of any expenses explicitly required pursuant
to this Agreement.

  



  

(h)   _Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
acknowledged and agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will each be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
subject to the limitations in _Section 9.8(b)_, except that, although the
Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies under
this Agreement, including by pursuing specific performance in
accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, _Section 9.8(b)_, under
no circumstances will the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or
entitled to receive both specific performance of the type contemplated by
_Section 9.8(b)_ and any monetary damages.

  



  

8.4   _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that after the Acceptance
Time, no amendment may be made to this Agreement which decreases the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

altered without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

9.3   _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written approval of the other Parties, except that Parent and Merger Sub
will have the right to assign all or any portion of their respective rights
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective
Time (a) in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or
Merger Sub or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation; (b) to any of their
respective Affiliates; or (c) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms
of the Financing for purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Financing, it being
understood that, in each case, such assignment will not (i) affect
the obligations of the parties (including Financing Sources) to the Financing
Letters or Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee; or (ii) impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Options pursuant to
this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will
relieve such Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

   

103

 

    



  

9.4   _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries furnished or made available to
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with
the Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to
cause their Representatives to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as if they were the counterparty thereto.

  



  

9.5   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or
referred to in this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Guarantee and the Financing Letters,
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b)
survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and
effect until the earlier to occur of the (i) Effective Time and (ii) date on
which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or
is validly terminated.

  



  

9.6   _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in
_Section 6.9_ and this _Section 9.6_, the Parties agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended
to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies under
this Agreement, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by _Section 6.9_;
and (b) if the requirements to a grant of specific performance set forth in
_Section 9.8(b)(ii)_  are met but a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to grant specific performance and has instead granted an award of
damages, then the Company may enforce such award; and (c) from and after the
Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Options to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in _Article
II_. The provisions of _Section 6.4(c)_ , _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_,
_Section 8.4_, _Section 9.3_ , _Section 9.8(b)(ii)_ ,  _Section 9.9_ ,
_Section 9.10(b)_, _Section 9.11_, _Section 9.14_ and this _Section
9.6_ will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors
and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third-party beneficiaries
thereof (it being understood and agreed that _Section 6.4(c)_ , _Section
8.2_, _Section 8.3, Section 8.4_, _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.8(b)(ii)_ ,
_Section 9.9_ , _Section 9.10(b)_, _Section 9.11_,  _Section 9.14_ and
this _Section 9.6_ will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and their
respective successors and assigns).

  



  

   

104

 

    



  

9.7   _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

9.8   _Remedies._

  



  

(a)   _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this
Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Transaction Document or
otherwise, although the Company may, subject in all respects to _Section
8.2_,  _Section 8.3_, this _Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.14_ (and, in each
case, the limitations set forth herein or therein), pursue both (i) a grant
of specific performance, and (ii) payment of monetary damages pursuant to 
_Section 8.2(b)_, or the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and when required
pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ , under no circumstances will the Company,
directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (A) both a grant
of specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment
Letter) and the occurrence of the Closing, on the one hand, and (1) payment
of any monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance) whatsoever or (2) payment of any of the Parent Termination Fee
and the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to _Section 8.3(f)(i)_ or
the Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand; or (B) both payment of any
monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance) whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of the amounts, if any,
as and when due, pursuant to _Section 8.3(f)(i)_ or the Reimbursement
Obligations, on the other hand.

  



  

(b)  Specific Performance.

  



  

(i)   _Irreparable Damage_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such
actions that are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the
Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties will be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms of this Agreement (including specific performance or
other equitable relief to cause Parent to perform any obligations required of
it to enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter); (B) the
provisions of _Section 8.3_ are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement,
and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
Party's right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement; _provided_  that under no circumstances shall
the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive both
a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief, on the one hand,
and the payment of any monetary damages, on the other hand.

  



  

   

105

 

    



  

(ii)   _Specific Performance in Respect of the Financing_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Transaction
Document, and subject in all respects to this _Section 9.8(b)(ii)_ , it is
acknowledged and agreed that the right of the Company to specific performance
to enforce Parent and each Borrower's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger, will be subject to the
requirements that (A) all of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each
of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing); (B) the
Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded in full at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail
to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to _Section 2.6_ ; (D)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur; and (E) Parent and Merger Sub fail
to complete the Closing within two (2) Business Days after delivery of the
Company's irrevocable written confirmation. In no event will the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Borrowers' obligation
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the
Debt Financing has not been funded in full (or will not be funded in full at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any of its equityholders be
entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement
directly against any Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities
as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing.

  



  

(iii)   _No Objections_. The Parties agree not to raise any
objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of
the Parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right
that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or other security.

  



  

(iv)   _Tolling of the Termination Date_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to the Termination Date any Party
initiates a Legal Proceeding to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement, then
the Termination Date will be automatically extended by (A) the amount of
time during which such Legal Proceeding is pending plus 20 Business Days; or
(B) such other time period established by the court presiding over such Legal
Proceeding.

  



  

   

106

 

    



  

9.9   _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware (subject to
_Section 9.10(b_ ) below with respect to Legal Proceedings involving Financing
Sources).

  



  

9.10   _Consent to Jurisdiction._

  



  

(a)   _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i)
irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any
other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger and the
Guarantee, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in
accordance with _Section 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law, but nothing in this _Section 9.10_ will affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any dispute or
controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Merger; (iii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen Court; (iv) agrees that
any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guarantee
or the Merger will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen
Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal
Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or
claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding
relating to this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Merger in any court other
than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that
a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Parent (A)
irrevocably designates Corporation Trust Company as its agent and attorney-
in-fact for the acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on
its behalf in any Legal Proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may
be necessary, proper or advisable in order to confer jurisdiction over it; and
(B) stipulates that such consent and appointment are irrevocable and coupled
with an interest.

  



  

(b)   _Jurisdiction for Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to Section 9.14(b), each
of the Parties acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that any Legal
Proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the
Merger, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters, or the performance
of services thereunder will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of
Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself
and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal
Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective
addresses provided in the Debt Commitment Letters will be effective service of
process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court;
(iv) to waive and waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of,
and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be
governed, construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of
New York. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) the
interpretation of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect and
whether or not a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred; (B)
the determination of the accuracy of any Specified Acquisition Agreement
Representations (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and whether as a
result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates has the right to terminate its obligations under this Agreement,
or to decline to consummate the Merger; and (C) the determination of whether
the Merger has been consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement will, in each case, be governed and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

   

107

 

    



  

9.11   _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTEE, THE FINANCING LETTERS
OR THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING OR AGAINST THE
FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.11_.

  



  

9.12   _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may
be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties,
it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any
such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party
may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the
fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

  



  

   

108

 

    



  

9.13   _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to
the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect
cannot be given to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations,
warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be
construed to be cumulative; (b) each representation, warranty, covenant and
closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and
independent effect; and (c) nothing set forth in any provision in
this Agreement will (except to the extent expressly stated) in any way be
deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision of
this Agreement.

  



  

9.14   _Non-recourse_.

  



  

(a)  Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Related
Parties, that all Legal Proceedings (whether in contract or in tort, in Law
or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited
liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to: (a) this Agreement,
any of the Transaction Documents or the Merger (including the Financing); (b)
the negotiation, execution or performance this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents (including any representation or warranty made in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents); (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement or any
of the Transaction Documents; and (d) any failure of the Merger to be
consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are those solely of)
the Persons that are, in the case of this Agreement, expressly identified as
parties to this Agreement, and in the case of the Transaction Documents,
Persons expressly identified as parties to such Transaction Documents and in
accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement
or such Transaction Documents, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents to the contrary, each Party
agrees, on behalf of itself and its Related Parties, that no recourse under
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or in connection with the
Merger will be sought or had against any other Person, including any Related
Party, and no other Person, including any Related Party, will have any
liabilities or obligations (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in
equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited
liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego
or otherwise), for any claims, causes of action, obligations or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any
manner to the items in the clauses (a) through (d), it being acknowledged and
agreed that no personal liability or losses whatsoever will attach to, be
imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of the aforementioned, as such,
arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the
items in the clauses (a) through (d), in each case, except for claims that
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, may assert (subject, with
respect to the following clauses (ii) and (iii), in all respects to the
limitations set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_, _Section 8.3(f)_,  _Section
8.3(g)_, _Section 8.3(h)_, _Section 9.8(b)_ and this _Section 9.14_): (i)
against any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement; (ii) against Guarantor under,
if, as and when required pursuant to the terms and conditions of the

conditions of, this Agreement.

  



  

   

109

 

    



  

(b)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each
Party agrees that in no event will the Company or any of its equityholders or
Affiliates (i) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for

EXHIBIT A 
  
 OFFER CONDITIONS

  



  

Notwithstanding any other term or provision of the Offer or this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause
Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to Merger Sub's obligation to purchase or return the tendered
shares of Company Common Stock promptly after termination or withdrawal of
the Offer), purchase any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and
not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date) pursuant to the Offer if:

  



  

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of
Company Common Stock which, considered together with all other shares of
Company Common Stock, if any, beneficially owned by Parent and its
Affiliates, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have
not yet been received, represent one more than 50% of the sum of (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the expiration of the
Offer, plus (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock then
issuable to holders of Company Options from which the Company has received
notices of exercise prior to the expiration of the Offer (and as to which
such shares have not yet been issued to such exercising holders of Company
Options) (the "Minimum Tender Condition");

  



  

(b) the applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the
HSR Act relating to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall not
have expired or otherwise been terminated; or

  



  

(c) any of the following conditions have occurred and shall be
continuing at the time of expiration of the Offer:

  



  

(i) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is then in effect and has the effect
of making the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or
prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

  



  

(ii) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any
change, event, effect or development that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(iii) (A) except as provided in clauses (B) and (C) below, the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
shall not have been true and correct (in each case, disregarding all
qualifications and exceptions contained therein regarding materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect or similar standard or qualification) as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on
and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representations and warranties expressly speak as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall not have been true and
correct as of such earlier date), except where the failure of any such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; (B) the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Sections 3.1(b)_ (Due Organization), _3.1(c)_
(Necessary Power and Authority), _3.19_ (Authority; Binding Nature of
Agreement), _3.20_ (Inapplicability of Anti-Takeover Statutes), _3.22_ (Non-
Contravention; Governmental Consents),  _3.23_ (Financial Advisor), _3.24_
(Fairness Opinion) shall not have been true and correct in all material
respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as
though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall not have been true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date); and (C) the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 3.3(a)_
(Capitalization) and _Section 3.3(c)_ (No Other Equity) shall not have
been true and correct as of the date of the Agreement and as of the
Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date and time, except for
_de minimis_ inaccuracies; _provided_ , that solely for purposes of clause (C)
above, if one or more inaccuracies in the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 3.3(a)_ (Capitalization) and _Section 3.3(c)_ (No Other
Equity) would cause damages or diminution in value to Parent or Merger Sub of
$100,000 or more, such inaccuracy or inaccuracies will be considered material
for purposes of clause (C) of this paragraph (iii).

material respects, with its obligations required to be performed or complied
with by it under this Agreement;

The foregoing conditions set forth above are for the sole benefit of Parent
and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part
at any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or
Merger Sub (except for the Minimum Tender Condition, which is non-
waivable), subject in each case to the terms of the Agreement and applicable
Law. Any reference in this _Exhibit A_ or in the Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or
requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend,
terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of
Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.
