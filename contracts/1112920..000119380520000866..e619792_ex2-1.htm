(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d&#45;15(e) under the Exchange Act) sufficient in all material respects to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act concerning
the Acquired Entities is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules,
and that all such material information is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Company&rsquo;s filings with the SEC as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. The Company, based on its most recent evaluation of its internal disclosure controls and procedures, has disclosed, to
the extent required by applicable Law, in any applicable Company SEC Document that is reported on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any
amendments thereto, and to the Company&rsquo;s auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on
such evaluation. The Company does not have any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.</P>

of the Company set forth in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (without giving effect to any materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth therein), Parent&rsquo;s cash on hand, together with the proceeds of

</FONT></FONT><I>Validity</I>. As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters (in the forms delivered by Borrowers to

and, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of Borrower, the other parties thereto, as applicable, in accordance with their
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters,
there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full proceeds of the Financing pursuant
to any agreement relating to the Financing to which Parent, each of the Borrowers, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
is a party. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent, Borrowers nor, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of Borrower,
any counterparty to the Financing Letters has committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or
is in default under, any of the Financing Letters, in each case, that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in Parent
and/or Borrowers being unable to obtain the Financing on the terms or conditions set forth in the Financing Letters and the Fee
Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of Borrower, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent, Borrowers or, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of Borrower, any of the other parties
thereto pursuant to the Financing Letters that would, or would reasonably be expected to, <FONT STYLE="color: black">result in

Company set forth in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (without giving effect to any materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth therein), Parent and Borrowers have no reason to believe (both before
and after giving effect to any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter) that (A) Parent and/or Borrowers will

within their control set forth in the Financing Letters; or (B) the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing Letters will

of such Legal Proceeding; and (B) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without
his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is
entirely responsible) which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding
for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination releases such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Indemnified Persons
and Surviving Corporation will (and Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to) reasonably cooperate in good faith in the defense
of any such matters. Parent shall guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this <U>Section 6.9(b)</U>.</P>

credit for all service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual
and severance pay entitlement), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication
of coverage or benefits or with respect to any defined benefit pension plan. In addition, for purposes of each Parent Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination
requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and the Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the comparable Company Benefit Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee&rsquo;s participation
in the corresponding Parent Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
co-payments, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Plan.</P>

or any Transaction Document, and subject in all respects to this <U>Section 9.8(b)(ii)</U>, it is acknowledged and agreed that
the right of the Company to specific performance to enforce Parent and each Borrower&rsquo;s obligation to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded and to consummate the Merger, will be subject to the requirements that (A)&nbsp;all of the conditions set forth in
<U>Section 7.1</U> and <U>Section 7.2</U> have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing); (B)&nbsp;the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (C)&nbsp;Parent
and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to <U>Section 2.6</U>; (D)&nbsp;the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are
funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur; and (E) Parent
and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within two (2) Business Days after delivery of the Company&rsquo;s irrevocable written
confirmation. In no event will the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Borrowers&rsquo; obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded in full (or will not
be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Company or any of its equityholders be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement directly
against any Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing.</P>

of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and
agreements of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened
breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide
