3.7 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment and Payments_.

  


 

  

(a) _Delivery of Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but not later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Representative a certificate of the chief financial officer of Parent (the "
_Proposed Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Parent's good faith
determination (each, without duplication) of (i) the Cash Amount (for the
avoidance of doubt, other than in respect of the Blockers), (ii) the Debt
Amount (for the avoidance of doubt, other than in respect of the Blockers),
(iii) the Closing Working Capital (calculated in accordance with _Exhibit A_
), which shall be based exclusively on the facts and circumstances as they
exist as of the Adjustment Time and shall exclude the effects of any event,
act, change in circumstance or similar development arising or occurring
thereafter (it being understood and agreed by the Parties that Proposed
Closing Statement shall be used to measure changes in Closing Working Capital
and not as a form of indemnification), (iv) the Company Transaction Expenses
Amount and (v) the Blocker Adjustment, in each case in accordance with the
definitions thereof, and based on such calculations, Parent's calculation of
the Closing Date Merger Consideration. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies and its and their respective officers, employees, agents
and representatives to, reasonably assist the Representative and its agents in
their review of the Proposed Closing Statement and shall provide the
Representative and its agents reasonable access during normal business hours
to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies for
such purpose and for the other purposes set forth in this _Section 3.7_
without cost to the Representative. Parent acknowledges and waives any actual
or potential conflict of the officers, employees, agents and representatives
of the Acquired Companies assisting the Representative as described in the
immediately preceding sentence and will not, and will cause the Acquired
Companies not to, prevent such access by the Representative.

  


 

  

(b) _Release of Undisputed Escrow Amount_. If Parent's calculation of the
Adjustment Amount as set forth on the Proposed Closing Statement is positive,
(i) Parent shall immediately pay to the Representative, for further
distribution to the Securityholders (to be paid to the Securityholders as if
such amount were being distributed pursuant to _Section 3.8(a)(i)_) such
positive Adjustment Amount; _provided_ that in no event will Parent be
required to pay an amount in excess of the Escrow Amount (it being understood
and agreed that such payment shall not limit the rights of the Representative
under this _Section 3.7_), and (ii) Parent and the Representative shall
immediately deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release the entire Escrow Amount to the
Representative, for further distribution to the Securityholders (to be paid to
the Securityholders as if such amount were being distributed pursuant to
_Section 3.8(a)(i)_). If Parent's calculation of the Adjustment Amount as set
forth on the Proposed Closing Statement is negative, Parent and the
Representative shall immediately deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to release the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount to be paid
to Parent solely and exclusively from the Escrow Account (up to a maximum
amount equal to the then-remaining Escrow Amount) and Parent and the
Representative shall immediately deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to release any portion of the Escrow Amount remaining following
such

  


 

  

 

36  

  


 

  

payment to Parent to the Representative for further distribution to the
Securityholders (to be paid to the Securityholders as if such amount were
being distributed pursuant to _Section 3.8(a)(i)_).

  


 

  

(c) _Methodology_. The Estimated Closing Statement, the Proposed Closing
Statement and the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
the definitions of Cash Amount, Debt Amount, Closing Working Capital and
Company Transaction Expenses. For purposes of calculating the Blocker Tax
Amount and Closing Working Capital, gain or loss to the Blockers in connection
with transfers of GB Holdco pursuant to the steps described in _Schedule 6.11_
of the Disclosure Letter shall be determined by assuming a value of GB Holdco
as set forth on _Schedule 3.7(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that
if, at any time prior to the Final Determination Date, GB Holdco, any GB
BlockerCo, any Securityholder, or any Affiliate of any Securityholder, enters
into any agreement to sell (directly or indirectly) or award (e.g., in
connection with the performance of services) any equity interest in GB Holdco
or any GB BlockerCo, or GB Holdco enters into any agreement to sell (directly
or indirectly) substantially all of the assets of GB Holdco, the
Representative shall notify Parent of such agreement, and the value of GB
Holdco may, at Parent's election, be assumed to be the valuation implied by
the purchase price in such sale agreement or reflected on or implied by such
award agreement (or associated election under Section 83(b) of the Code). For
the avoidance of doubt, in calculating the component line items of such
statements, no effect shall be given to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than the steps describe in _Schedule 6.11_ of the Disclosure
Letter).

  


 

  

(d) _Notice of Disagreement_. In the event the Representative disputes the
accuracy of the Proposed Closing Statement, the Representative shall notify
Parent in writing of its objections within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Proposed Closing Statement and shall set forth, in writing and in
reasonable detail, the reasons for the Representative's objections (a "
_Notice of Disagreement_ "). In the event Parent does not provide the
Representative any of the materials reasonably requested by the Representative
in accordance with _Section 3.7(a)_ within five (5) days of request therefor,
such thirty (30) day review period shall be extended by one (1) day for each
additional day required for Parent to fully respond to such request.

  


 

  

(e) _Initial Method of Resolution_. During the fifteen (15) days immediately
following the delivery of any Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they
may have with respect to any matter specified in such Notice of Disagreement.
During such period, Parent and the Representative and their respective agents
shall each have access to the other Party's working papers, trial balances and
similar materials prepared in connection with the other Party's preparation of
the Proposed Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement, as the case may
be. The matters set forth in any such written resolution executed by Parent
and the Representative shall be final and binding on the Parties on the date
of such written resolution.

  


 

  

(f) _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. If, at the end of such fifteen (15) day
period specified in _Section 3.7(e)_, Parent and the Representative have not
been able to resolve, in writing, all differences that they may have with
respect to any matter specified in such Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the
Representative shall submit to Grant Thornton or, if such firm is unable to
serve in such capacity, to such other nationally recognized independent
accounting firm with experience in such matters that is mutually agreed upon
by Parent and the

  


 

  

 

37  

  


 

  

Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ "), for review and resolution of
solely those matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement that remain in
dispute (and as to no other matter), and the Accounting Firm shall reach a
final, binding resolution of such matters, which final resolution shall not be
subject to collateral attack for any reason (other than fraud or manifest
error) and shall be (i) in writing and signed by the Accounting Firm, (ii)
within the range of the amount of each item in dispute contested by the
Representative and Parent on an item by item basis, (iii) furnished to Parent
and the Representative as soon as practicable after the items in dispute have
been referred to the Accounting Firm, which shall not be more than sixty (60)
days after such referral, (iv) made in accordance with this Agreement and (v)
conclusive and binding upon the Parties on the date of delivery of such
written resolution. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting
Firm shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether
the items in dispute were determined in accordance with the definitions of
Cash Amount, Debt Amount, Closing Working Capital and Company Transaction
Expenses and the methodology set forth on _Exhibit A_ without regard to
materiality and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination and
shall act as an arbitrator and not as an expert. In resolving any disputed
item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such items claimed by either Parent or the Representative
or less than the smallest value of such items claimed by either Parent or the
Representative. Parent and the Representative agree to execute, if requested
by the Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement letter in customary form.
Parent and the Representative agree to cooperate fully with the Accounting
Firm and promptly provide all documents and information requested by the
Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make such determination as quickly and
as accurately as practicable. The procedure outlined in this _Section 3.7(f)_
is referred to as the " _Dispute Resolution Procedure_ ".

  


 

  

(g) _Final Closing Statement_. The Proposed Closing Statement shall become the
" _Final Closing Statement_ " (i) on the earliest of (A) the first (1st) day
following the end of the review period of the Proposed Closing Statement (as
calculated in accordance with _Section 3.7(d)_), if a Notice of Disagreement
has not been delivered to Parent by the Representative, (B) the date upon
which the Representative acknowledges in writing that it has no objections to
the Proposed Closing Statement, (C) the date of resolution of all matters set
forth in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to _Section 3.7(e)_ and (D) the
date upon which the Accounting Firm reaches a final, binding resolution of
solely those matters specified in any Notice of Disagreement pursuant to
_Section 3.7(f)_, (ii) with such changes as are necessary to reflect matters
resolved pursuant to any written resolution executed pursuant to _Section
3.7(e)_, on the date such resolution is executed, if all outstanding matters
are resolved through such resolution and (iii) with such changes as are
necessary to reflect the Accounting Firm's resolution of matters in dispute,
on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final, binding resolution
pursuant to _Section 3.7(f)_. The date on which the Proposed Closing Statement
shall become the Final Closing Statement pursuant to the immediately foregoing
sentence is referred to as the " _Final Determination Date_ ".

  


 

  

(h) _Dispute Resolution Expenses_. Parent and the Representative shall each
pay their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Dispute
Resolution Procedure. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm
shall be allocated to and borne by Parent and the Representative (for the
account of the Securityholders) based on the inverse of the percentage that
the Accounting Firm's determination (before such allocation) bears to the
total

  


 

  

 

38  

  


 

  

amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Accounting
Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and
the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Representative's position,
sixty percent (60%) of the costs payable to the Accounting Firm would be borne
by Parent and forty percent (40%) of the costs would be borne by the
Representative (for the account of the Securityholders). The Representative
shall be reimbursed in accordance with _Section 10.15_ for any Charges
incurred by the Representative under this _Section 3.7_, including for the
reasonable fees and expenses of any accountants, advisors or other
representatives engaged by the Representative in connection with the
determination of the Final Closing Statement under this _Section 3.7_
(including any Dispute Resolution Procedure hereunder).

  


 

  

(i) _No Adverse Actions_. Following the Closing until the Final Determination
Date, Parent agrees that it shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
not to, solely with respect to the calculations required pursuant to this
_Section 3.7_, take any actions with respect to the accounting books and
records of the Acquired Companies on which the Proposed Closing Statement and
Final Closing Statement are to be based or the items reflected thereon, that
are not consistent with the definitions of Cash Amount, Debt Amount, Closing
Working Capital and Company Transaction Expenses.

  


 

  

3.8 _Final Adjustment Payment_.

  


 

  

(a) No later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Final
Determination Date:

  


 

  

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is positive:

  


 

  

(1) with respect to each Securityholder who shall have delivered to the
Company, on or prior to such date, a completed Letter of Transmittal, Parent
shall pay, or shall cause the Surviving Company to pay, to each Securityholder
such Securityholder's Pro Rata Share of the Adjustment Amount in excess of the
Escrow Amount, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated in such Securityholder's Letter of
Transmittal; _provided_ that in no event will Parent be required to pay an
aggregate amount pursuant to this _Section 3.8(a)(i)(1)_ in excess of the
Escrow Amount; and

  


 

  

(2) Parent and the Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Amount to the Representative, in each
case, for further distribution to the Securityholders as if such amounts were
being distributed pursuant to _Section 3.8(a)(i)(1)._

  


 

  

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is negative, then Parent and the Representative
shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount to be paid to Parent solely and
exclusively from the Escrow Account (up to a maximum amount equal to the then-
remaining Escrow Amount) and Parent and the Representative shall provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release any portion of the
Escrow Amount remaining following such

  


 

  

 

39  

  


 

  

payment to Parent to the Representative for further distribution to the
Securityholders as if such amounts were being distributed pursuant to _Section
3.8(a)(i)(1)_.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent's sole
recourse for payment of any such deficiency pursuant to _Section 3.8(a)(ii)_
shall be to the Escrow Account and neither Parent nor the Acquired Companies
or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any claim against any
Securityholder or the Representative or any of their respective Affiliates in
respect thereof.

  


 

  

(c) Any amount paid in respect of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to this
_Article III_ shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Final
Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

  


 

  

3.9 _Post-Closing Matters_. From and after the Closing Date, with respect to
each Securityholder who shall not have delivered to the Company, on or prior
to the Closing Date, a Letter of Transmittal, Parent shall, promptly (but in
no event later than five (5) Business Days) following such Securityholder's
delivery to the Company of a completed Letter of Transmittal, pay, or cause
the Surviving Company to pay, all amounts that would previously have been
payable with respect to such Equity Securities pursuant to this _Article III_
had such Letter of Transmittal been delivered on or prior to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

3.10 _No Withholding_. Parent (and its Affiliates) shall not be entitled to
deduct and withhold any amount from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, except such amounts as Parent (or its Affiliates)
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Tax Law as a result of a change in Law after the date hereof
or any failure to provide any Tax certificate in accordance with _Section
3.6(b)_ or _Section 6.8_ or as reasonably requested by the Paying Agent
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, an IRS Form W-9 or W-8, as
applicable); _provided_ , that the Company shall deduct and withhold from any
payments required to be made to current or former directors, officers,
employees and consultants pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payments under any applicable Tax Law. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate
to reduce or eliminate any amounts that would be required to be deducted or
withheld on any payments hereunder.

  


 

  

3.11 _No Liability_. Parent, Merger Subs and the Acquired Companies shall have
no Liability to any of the Securityholders for any act or omission by the
Escrow Agent, the Representative or Payment Agent pursuant to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Payment Agent Agreement. As long as Parent
complies with its obligations in _Section 3.6(b)_ to make such payments to
Payment Agent, Parent and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)
shall have no further responsibility in connection with (or Liability for)
payment of the Closing Date Merger Consideration and Securityholders shall
only look to Payment Agent for any amount they are due in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

character of its properties owned, possessed, licensed, operated or leased, or

Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(b) The Company has delivered to Parent true and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents for each of the Acquired Companies and GB Holdco as

ARTICLE V

  


 

  

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUBS_

  


 

  

Parent and each Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  


 

  

5.1 _Organization of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and each Merger
Sub is a corporation or limited liability company, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized.

  


 

  

5.2 _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. Each Merger Sub is a
wholly‑owned Subsidiary of Parent, was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in
no business activity other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Except for
obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each Merger Sub has not and will not have
incurred, directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary or Affiliate, any
obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type
or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any
Person.

  


 

  

5.3 _Authorization; Enforceability_. Each of Parent and each Merger Sub has
requisite organizational power (corporate or otherwise) and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby by Parent and each Merger Sub and the consummation by
Parent and each Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational
(corporate or otherwise) action, and no other organizational (corporate or
otherwise) proceedings on the part of Parent and each Merger Sub and no
stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, other than the
filing and recordation of the Certificates of Merger. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Parent and each Merger Sub and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other Parties,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Parent and each Merger
Sub, enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions, subject to Laws
of general application relating to public policy, bankruptcy, insolvency and
the relief of

  


 

  

 

62  

  


 

  

debtors and rules of Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and
other equitable remedies.

  


 

  

5.4 _Noncontravention_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance
by Parent and each Merger Sub with any of the terms or provisions hereof will
(i) violate any constitution, statute, regulation, rule, injunction, judgment,
order, decree, ruling, charge or other restriction of any Governmental
Authority to which Parent, any Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective properties or assets is subject or any provision of
their respective Organizational Documents, or (ii) conflict with, result in a
breach of, constitute a default under, result in the acceleration of, create
in any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel or require
any notice under any agreement, Contract, lease, license, instrument or other
arrangement to which Parent or any Merger Sub is a party or by which it is
bound or to which any of their respective properties or assets are subject;
provided, however, no representation or warranty is made in foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii) with respect to such matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except for
the filing of the Certificates of Merger under the DLLCA, DGCL and the
pre‑merger notification requirements of the HSR Act or where the failure to
give notice to, make any filing with or obtain the authorization, consent or
approval of a Governmental Authority would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of the
Merger Subs needs to give any notice to, make any filing with or obtain any
authorization, consent or approval of any Governmental Authority in order for
the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

5.5 _Brokers ' Fees_. Neither Parent nor any of the Merger Subs has any
Liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder
or agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other
than those that are solely the responsibility of Parent.

  


 

  

5.6 _Litigation_. There are no (a) Proceedings pending against, or to Parent's
Knowledge, threatened against, Parent or Merger Subs or their respective
Affiliates or (b) material judgment, order or decree against Parent, Merger
Subs or their respective Affiliates, in each case, that would result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

5.7 _Financial Ability_. As of the Closing, Parent will have sufficient
immediately available funds to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the payment of the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.6_
and the payment of all associated costs and expenses of Parent in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has provided the
Company a true and complete copy, as of the date hereof, of an executed
commitment letter and fee letter (as may be amended or replaced from time to
time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, collectively, the " _Debt
Financing Commitment Letters_ ") from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("
_MSSF_ ", together with each lender that becomes a party to such commitment
letter as a commitment party thereunder, the " _Lenders_ ") to provide,
subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set
forth therein for the purpose of funding in part the cash consideration for
the Merger (the " _Debt Financing_ ") ( _provided_ , that provisions in any
fee letter included in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters related solely to
fees, economic terms and "flex" provisions may be

  


 

  

 

63  

  


 

  

redacted so long as none of the redacted provisions would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the availability of or impose additional
conditions on, the availability of the Debt Financing at the Closing). As of
the date hereof, none of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters have been
amended or modified and no such amendment or modification is contemplated or
pending (other than amendments or modifications to the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents and similar entities). As of the date hereof, each Debt
Financing Commitment Letter is valid, binding and, to Parent's Knowledge,
enforceable by Parent against the other parties thereto in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally or (b) applicable equity principles
(whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). As of the date
hereof, each Debt Financing Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
the respective obligations and commitments have not been withdrawn, rescinded
or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and no such
withdrawal, rescission or termination is contemplated by Parent or any Merger
Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent and each Merger Sub, the other parties
thereto (other than any customary amendment to include new lenders, lead
arrangers, book runners, syndication agents and other similar entities). As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach or default on the part of Parent or any Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge
of Parent and the Merger Subs, any of the other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
_Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ hereof, as of the date hereof, Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment
Letters will not be satisfied, or that the full amount of the Debt Financing
will not be made available at or prior to Closing in order to consummate the
Merger. As of the date hereof, no Lender has notified Parent of its intention
to terminate any of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or not to provide
the Debt Financing. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions in
_Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ hereof and (ii) that the Debt Financing is
funded in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters,
the aggregate net proceeds from the Debt Financing will be sufficient to fund
the Closing Date Merger Consideration, the payment of any fees and expenses of
or payable by Parent and the Merger Subs and any other amounts required to be
paid by Parent and the Merger Subs in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Required
Financing Amount_ "). Parent has paid in full any and all commitment or other
fees required by any of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters that are due as
of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such fees as they
become due. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
Contracts (other than an engagement letter dated the date hereof between
Parent and MSSF, a term loan commitment letter dated the date hereof between
Parent and MSSF, and a term loan fee letter dated the date hereof between
Parent and MSSF, each of which, for the avoidance of doubt, relates to the
proposed refinancings of the Debt Financing and each of which does not modify
the terms or conditions of the Debt Financing) relating to the Debt Financing
to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters. The Debt Financing
Commitment Letters are not subject to any conditions other than as expressly
set forth therein. As of the date hereof, each of Parent and each of the
Merger Subs is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof
that would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters

  


 

  

 

64  

  


 

  

inaccurate or that would reasonably be expected to cause the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters to be ineffective.

  


 

  

5.8 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor any Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby to which it is, or is
specified to be, a party, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any financing
in connection with the Closing), the Surviving Blockers and the Surviving
Company and each of its Subsidiaries will be Solvent. No transfer of property
is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay
or defraud either present or future creditors of the Surviving Blockers, the
Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

5.9 _Acknowledgements by Parent and Merger Subs_.

satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of the financial
condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and

Parent and Merger Subs have relied solely on the results of their own
independent investigation and verification and the representations and
warranties of the Company and the Blockers expressly and specifically set
forth in _Article IV_ (Representations and Warranties of the Company and
Blockers) as qualified by the Disclosure Letter. Such representations and
warranties by the Company and the Blockers constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Acquired Companies to Parent and Merger
Subs in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent and
Merger Subs understand, acknowledge and agree that all other representations

limited to, the future or historical financial condition, results of
operations, prospects, business, assets or liabilities of the Acquired
Companies or relationships with landlords, the ability of the Acquired
Companies to, enter into new markets, maintain licenses, leases and Permits,
obtain regulatory consents, or renew real property leases (including on
favorable terms)), whether made by the Acquired Companies, any of their
Affiliates or any of their respective managers, partners, officers, directors,
employees, advisors, consultants, agents or representatives, whether in any
individual, corporate or any other capacity, are specifically disclaimed by
the Company, the Blockers and the Securityholders. None of the Company, the
Blockers or any Securityholder makes or provides, and Parent and Merger Subs
hereby waive, any warranty or representation, express or implied, as to the
quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, conformity to
samples, or condition of the Acquired Companies' assets or any part thereof.
Parent and Merger Subs, on behalf of themselves and any of their Affiliates,
specifically disclaim any reliance on any representations and warranties other
than the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_.

  


 

  

(b) PARENT AND MERGER SUBS SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, (X) PARENT
AND MERGER SUBS ARE ACQUIRING THE COMPANY AND BLOCKERS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS"
BASIS AND (Y) OTHER THAN THE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE IV_
(REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND BLOCKERS), NONE OF THE
ACQUIRED

  


 

  

 

65  

  


 

  

COMPANIES, THE SECURITYHOLDERS (INCLUDING THE REPRESENTATIVE) OR ANY OTHER
PERSON (INCLUDING, ANY OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES' AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE MANAGERS, PARTNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ADVISORS,
CONSULTANTS, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES, WHETHER IN ANY INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE
OR ANY OTHER CAPACITY) IS MAKING, AND NEITHER PARENT NOR ANY MERGER SUB IS
RELYING ON, ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR OTHER STATEMENTS OF ANY KIND
WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR
OTHERWISE, AS TO ANY MATTER CONCERNING THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF
ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO (OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED BY) PARENT OR ANY MERGER
SUB OR ANY OF PARENT'S REPRESENTATIVES.

  


 

  

(c) In connection with the investigation by Parent and Merger Subs of the
Acquired Companies, Parent and Merger Subs have received or may receive from
the Acquired Companies certain projections, forward looking statements and
other forecasts. Parent and Merger Subs acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forward looking
statements and other forecasts, that Parent and Merger Subs are familiar with
such uncertainties, that Parent and Merger Subs are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all
projections, forward looking statements and other forecasts so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections,
forward looking statements and other forecasts), and that none of the Acquired
Companies, any of the Securityholders (including the Representative) or any of
their respective Affiliates or any of their respective managers, partners,
officers, directors, employees, advisors, consultants, agents or
representatives, whether in an individual, corporate or any other capacity,
will have or be subject to any Liability or indemnification obligation to
Parent or Merger Subs or any other Person resulting from (nor shall Parent or
Merger Subs have any claim with respect to) the distribution to Parent or
Merger Subs, or Parent's, any Merger Sub's use of, or reliance on, any
information, documents, projections, forward looking statements, and forecasts
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections,
forward looking statements and forecasts), or other material made available to
Parent or any Merger Sub in certain "data rooms," confidential information
memoranda or management presentations in expectation of, or in connection
with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, regardless of the legal
theory under which such Liability may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise.

to use its best efforts to, and to cause its Affiliates to, cause the Closing
to occur as soon as possible after the date hereof, including satisfying the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_ within the control of such
Party, defending against any Proceedings, judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions

(b) Each of Parent and the Company will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
give any notices to, make any filings with, and use its best efforts to obtain
any authorizations, consents and approvals of, any Governmental Authority
which are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates to, no later than five (5) Business Days after the date
hereof, prepare and file with the United States Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ ") the notification and report form required under the HSR Act or any

Authority.

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall

necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain
all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under the HSR Act, the Sherman

applicable Law (including foreign laws) designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ ") that may be required by any
Governmental Authority, so as to enable the Parties to cause the Closing to
occur as soon as practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date,
including (i) proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effect (and if
such offer is accepted, committing to and effecting), by order, consent
decree, hold separate order, trust, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license, disposition or hold separate of such assets or businesses of Parent
or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries (or, in the case of Parent,
its Affiliates), or otherwise offering to take or offering to commit to take
any action (including any action that limits its freedom of action, ownership
or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, any of the
businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of Parent or the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries (or, in the case of Parent, its
Affiliates)) to the extent legally permissible, and if the offer is accepted,
taking or committing to take such action, (ii) terminating, relinquishing,
modifying or waiving existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other arrangements of Parent or the Company or their respective

action unless the taking of such action is conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(each, a " _Remedial Action_ "), in each case, as may be necessary, required
or advisable in order to obtain clearance under the HSR Act or other
applicable Law, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or to
vacate or lift, any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would otherwise have the effect of
restraining, preventing or delaying the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, or to avoid the commencement of any
Proceeding that seeks to prohibit the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to take any
Remedial Action either with respect to the Global Marine Business or Parent to
the extent that such action, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on (i) the
Global Marine Business or (ii) Parent (measured on the basis of a business of
comparable size to the Global Marine Business, and excluding, for such
purpose, Parent's fitness business) (a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). The
Company and their Affiliates shall agree to any Remedial Action with respect
to the Global Marine Business only as and to the extent directed by Parent, so
long as such Remedial Action is conditioned on the Closing.

  


 

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any objections are
asserted with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby under the HSR Act or other applicable Law or if any Proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, is instituted by any Governmental Authority or any
private party challenging the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act or other applicable Law, each
of the Parties shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with one
another and Parent shall use its best efforts to (i) oppose or defend against
any action to prevent or enjoin consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and/or (ii) take any and all actions as
necessary to overturn any action by any Governmental Authority or private
party to block consummation of the Merger and any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including by defending any Proceeding brought by any
Governmental Authority or private party in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any
applicable Law or order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or in order to resolve any such objections or challenge
as such Governmental Authority or private party may have to such transactions
under such applicable Law so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as may be prohibited
by any Governmental Authority or by any applicable Law, Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company on the other, will, and the Company will cause its
Affiliates to, reasonably consult and cooperate with one another and consider
in good faith the views of one another in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with any Proceeding under or relating to the
HSR Act. In addition,

  


 

  

 

70  

  


 

  

except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any applicable
Law, in connection with any Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws, each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other, will, and the Company will cause its Affiliates to, permit outside
counsel of the other Party to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to any such Proceeding and to be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
in connection with any such Proceeding.

  


 

  

(f) The Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, promptly notify
the other Parties of any correspondence or contact with the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority and except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Authority or by any applicable Law, or as necessary to preserve any applicable
legal privilege, shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, furnish to the
other Parties (if necessary or advisable, on an outside counsel basis) all
such information in its possession as may be necessary for the completion of
any required reports or notifications. Neither Parent nor the Company shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates not to, agree to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation
or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall control (i) the strategy for obtaining any consents,
waivers and approvals from any Governmental Authority concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the positions to be
taken, the regulatory actions to be requested and the submissions to be made
(including, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals) in any filing with any Governmental
Authority concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
related investigation, inquiry, litigation or other regulatory matter by or
before, or any negotiations with, any Governmental Authority; _provided_ that
Parent shall in good faith consult with the Representative with respect to
such strategy, positions, requested regulatory action and submissions.

  


 

  

6.3 _Disclosure Letter_. Each matter, information or item disclosed in the
Disclosure Letter shall be in writing and shall qualify this Agreement. The
inclusion of an item in a Schedule to the Disclosure Letter as an exception to
a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by any Party, as
applicable, that such item (or any non-disclosed item or information of
comparable or greater significance) represents an exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item constitutes or would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or that such item or fact will in fact exceed any applicable threshold
limitation set forth in this Agreement. The inclusion of any matter,
information or item in the Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute
an admission of any Liability by the Company to any third party, any
Governmental Authority, under any Law or otherwise imply that any such matter,
information or item is material or creates a measure for materiality for the
purposes of the Agreement. Nothing in the Disclosure Letter is intended to
broaden the scope of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company
contained in this Agreement. The Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as,

representations or warranties of the Company. Any fact or item that is
disclosed in any Schedule to the Disclosure Letter in a way as to make its
relevance or applicability to information called for by any other Schedule to

71  

  


 

  

disclosed in such other Schedule, notwithstanding the omission of a reference
or cross-reference thereto. Descriptions of terms or documents summarized in

operations of the Acquired Companies, to the premises, management, books,
records, Contracts and documents of or pertaining to the Acquired Companies or
the Global Marine Business or (ii) impose any material costs on the Acquired
Companies; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to afford such

confidentiality obligations owing to third parties; _provided_ , _further_
that the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the access or information sought in a manner

warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any) provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.5(a)_, and neither Parent nor any Merger Sub may rely on the
accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as expressly set

contained in _Article IV_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
Parent or any of its representatives have any right to perform invasive or
subsurface investigations of the properties or facilities of the Acquired
Companies. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.5(a)_

terminated without any penalty, cost or consideration to be payable or
incurred by any Acquired Company or the Global Marine Business following the
Closing and all payments thereunder to be made prior to the Closing and for
the parties thereto to release and waive any and all claims that any of them
may have thereunder as of the Closing. The Company will provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any Contracts, resolutions,
consents, filings and other documents related to such terminations , which
comments the Company shall consider in good faith. With effect from the
Closing, none of the Acquired Companies or the Global Marine Business, on the
one hand, nor any Related Person, any other member of the PP Group or
Securityholder or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, shall have any
obligation or Liability to the other in respect of any such terminated
Affiliate Contract or any other terminated Contracts set forth in _Schedule
6.6_ of the Disclosure Letter.

Company shall (a) solicit waivers from each Person who has a right to any
payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein that would be deemed to constitute "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (hereafter, "

approval of the Securityholders in a manner intended to comply with Sections
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of any Waived 280G Benefits.

commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and the members of the PP Group's
respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal

Representatives_ ") to, at Parent's sole expense, provide any cooperation that
is reasonably necessary and customary and reasonably requested by Parent to
assist Parent in the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any permanent debt

preparation of customary materials for lender presentations, bank information
memoranda, road show presentations, materials for rating agency presentations
and similar documents reasonably required in connection with obtaining and
syndicating the Debt Financing, (iii) participating at reasonable times in a
reasonable number of meetings or conference calls required in connection with
obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing, (iv) furnishing Parent and the
Financing Sources with the financial statements required by Paragraph 3 of
Exhibit B to the Debt Financing Commitment Letters and any other information
(business, financial or otherwise) regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is readily available and (x) reasonably necessary for Parent to prepare
pro forma financial information for use in any of the materials described in
clause (ii) above or (y) is otherwise required by the Debt Financing

the Financing Sources prior to the Closing all documentation and other
information that any such Financing Sources have reasonably requested in
writing at least 10 Business Days prior to Closing and that is required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act; _provided_ ,
however, that (w) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent that it
would (A) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_ or
_Section 7.2_ to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement or (B) reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate any member
of the PP Group's organizational documents or any Law, result in the loss of
privilege, or result in the contravention of, or result in a violation or
breach of, or default under, any material Contract of any member of the PP
Group, (x) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would require any of the PP Group or any of the PP Group Representatives to
pay any fees or expenses or otherwise incur any Liability or give any
indemnities prior to the Closing (except (A) in the case of the Acquired
Companies only, to the extent the payment of any such fee or expense is
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger or (B) Parent has advanced the
amount of such fees, expenses or liabilities to the relevant member of the PP
Group), (y) (A) no member of the PP Group (other than Acquired Companies) nor
any of the PP Group's Representatives (other than officers and directors of
the Acquired Companies that will continue in such capacities with such
Acquired Companies following Closing) shall be required to execute or deliver
any documentation and (B) no Acquired Companies nor any PP Group
Representatives of Acquired Companies (other than officers and

  


 

  

 

74  

  


 

  

directors of the Acquired Companies that will continue in such capacities with

shall be required that unreasonably interferes with the business or the
ongoing operations of the PP Group. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall, to the
extent reasonably necessary to obtain the Debt Financing, be permitted to
share information obtained from or on behalf of the Company with the Financing
Sources and the other Lender Related Parties, subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings by such Financing Sources with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) Parent
seeks to obtain any Alternative Debt Financing Commitment Letter or
Alternative Debt Financing, (ii) the cooperation required to be provided
pursuant to this _Section 6.10(a)_ in connection with such Alternative Debt
Financing Commitment Letter or Alternative Debt Financing is more onerous than
what is required to be provided pursuant to this _Section 6.10(a)_ with
respect to the Debt Financing Commitment Letters in effect on the date hereof
without giving effect to any Alternative Debt Financing Commitment Letter or
Alternative Debt Financing contemplated thereunder (to the extent more
onerous, the " _Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation_ "), and (iii) the
Company fails to provide any portion of such Incremental Debt Financing
Cooperation, then such failure to provide such Incremental Debt Financing
Cooperation shall not be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.10(a)_ for
purposes of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the PP Group and the PP Group
Representatives and their respective Affiliates from and against any and all
losses, damages, liabilities, taxes, costs and expenses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith. Parent shall, upon the request
of the relevant member of the PP Group, promptly reimburse such member of the
PP Group or its PP Group Representatives for all documented out-of-pocket
costs or expenses incurred by such member of the PP Group or such PP Group
Representative, as applicable, in connection with the cooperation required by
_Section 6.10(a)_. No member of the PP Group nor any PP Group Representative
shall have any liability in respect of any information provided pursuant to
_Section 6.10(a)_.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each of Parent
and the Merger Subs acknowledges and agrees that (i) neither the obtaining of
the Debt Financing nor the obtaining of any other financing is a condition to
the Closing, and (ii) none of Parent's or the Merger Subs' respective
obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon Parent or the Merger
Subs obtaining the Debt Financing or any other financing in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(d) Each of Parent and each Merger Sub shall (i) use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters (including, to the extent required in accordance with the
terms thereof, the exercise of so-called "flex" provisions), including using
reasonable best efforts to (A) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
precedent to funding applicable to Parent and Merger Subs in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters and the definitive financing agreements to be
entered into pursuant thereto and, upon the satisfaction or

  


 

  

 

75  

  


 

  

waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_,
to consummate the Debt Financing no later than the Closing in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, and (B) maintain in full force and effect the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters until the funding of the Debt Financing at Closing and to
negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to such Debt
Financing consistent with the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters (subject to any applicable "flex" provisions) or,
if applicable, on terms that are no less favorable to Parent and each Merger
Sub than the terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (taking
into account any "flex" provisions applicable thereto), (ii) upon the
satisfaction of all conditions precedent to funding in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters, enforce the obligations of the Financing Sources to fund
the Debt Financing, and (iii) comply in all material respects with their
obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters and definitive
financing agreements entered into pursuant thereto. Upon request of the
Company, Parent shall promptly update the Company in reasonable detail of any
material developments concerning the status of the Debt Financing. Parent and
each Merger Sub shall provide the Company, upon request, with copies of any
definitive agreements for the Debt Financing and such other information and
documentation regarding the Debt Financing as may be entered into prior to
Closing. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters
(subject to any applicable "flex" provisions applicable thereto), (A) Parent
shall notify the Company, and (B) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative debt
financing from alternative debt financing sources (the " _Alternative Debt
Financing_ "), upon terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent and each
Merger Sub than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters (assuming the full exercise of any applicable "flex"
provisions), in an aggregate amount that, when taken together with the
available portion (if any) of the Debt Financing and other immediately
available cash and cash equivalents of Parent and the Merger Subs, would be
sufficient to pay the Required Financing Amount. In the event any Alternative
Debt Financing is obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.10(d)_,
references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing shall be deemed to refer to
such Alternative Debt Financing to the extent the Debt Financing has been
replaced thereby, if one or more commitment letters and/or fee letters are
entered into in connection with such Alternative Debt Financing (such
commitment letters and fee letters, the " _Alternative Debt Commitment Letter_
s"), references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing Commitment Letters
shall be deemed to refer to the Alternative Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent the Debt Financing Commitment Letters have been replaced thereby, and
all obligations of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company pursuant to this
_Section 6.10_ shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as the
obligations of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company with respect to the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters replaced thereby. None of Parent and the
Merger Subs shall permit or consent to (1) any amendment, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision under, any Debt Financing
Commitment Letter if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver (w)
imposes new or additional conditions, or otherwise expands any of the
conditions, to the initial funding of the Debt Financing at Closing from those
set forth therein on the date hereof, (x) would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent or any Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the applicable Debt Financing
Commitment Letter ( _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Subs may replace or
amend the Debt Financing Commitment

  


 

  

 

76  

  


 

  

Letters solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment
Letters as of the date hereof), (y) would reasonably be expected to materially
impair, materially delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of
the Debt Financing or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (z) would reduce the aggregate cash amount of the Debt
Financing to an amount that is less than the Required Financing Amount, or (2)
early termination of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (other than in
connection with Alternative Debt Financing). Parent shall furnish to the
Company a copy of any amendment, modification or waiver of any Debt Financing
Commitment Letter upon execution thereof, in each case, to the extent entered
into prior to Closing; _provided_ , that any amendment of any fee letter may
be redacted to the extent permitted under _Section 5.7_. Parent shall promptly
notify the Company in writing (I) of any material breach or default (or any
event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default)
by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment Letter or definitive agreement
for the Debt Financing of which Parent obtains knowledge, (II) of the receipt
by any of Parent, any Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives of any notice or other communication from any Financing Source
with respect to any actual, threatened or alleged material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment
Letter or any definitive agreement for the Debt Financing or any provision of
the Debt Financing contemplated pursuant to any of the foregoing (including
any proposal by any Financing Source to withdraw, terminate or make a material
change in the terms of (including the amount of Debt Financing contemplated
by) the Debt Financing Commitment Letters), (III) if for any reason any of
Parent or any Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or the
definitive agreements for the Debt Financing and (IV) of the termination or
expiration prior to Closing of any Debt Financing Commitment Letter or
definitive agreement for the Debt Financing. As soon as practicable, Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this _Section
6.10(d)_.

actions, the " _GB Restructuring_ "). Any changes to the Reorganization Plan
proposed by the Representative after the date hereof and at any time prior to
Closing shall be subject to Parent's prior written consent, with such changes
that are approved by Parent to be incorporated in a revised Reorganization
Plan. For the sake of clarity, Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
representations and warranties made by the Blockers and the Company in

occur until after the date hereof.

comment on the Contracts, resolutions, consents, filings and other documents
to effectuate the GB Restructuring (the " _GB Restructuring Documents_ "),

77  

  


 

  

consider in good faith but shall not be obligated to accept so long as the GB
Restructuring Documents are substantially consistent with the Reorganization
Plan. Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, Parent, the Company and
the Blockers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply
with the terms of the Reorganization Plan.

  


 

  

(c) None of the Acquired Companies shall be required to make any
representations or warranties or sign or provide any release or indemnity in
favor of the GB Group in the GB Restructuring Documents. The GB Restructuring
Documents shall provide that none of the Acquired Companies will have any
Reorganization Plan Liabilities or obligations to any member of the GB Group
or any other Person following the completion of the GB Restructuring.

from the assumption of any Global Marine Liabilities as contemplated by the
Reorganization Plan), (ii) Liabilities for the expenses of the formation of
new entities by the Company or its Affiliates prior to the Closing required
pursuant to the Reorganization Plan (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding any entity formed by Parent or its Affiliates), (iii) Liabilities
arising from a failure by the Acquired Companies, GB Holdco or their
respective Affiliates to comply with this _Section 6.11_ (in the case of any

shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and its and their respective
Affiliates to, cause all intercompany indebtedness, accounts, and balances

other hand, to be eliminated with no further Liability or obligation on the

reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (b) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person (other than Parent) any information with

lead to an Alternative Proposal or (c) approve, endorse, recommend, execute or
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in

Proposal. The Company shall, shall cause its Affiliates to and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Affiliates' respective
representatives to, immediately cease all solicitation, encouragement,
discussions and negotiations regarding any inquiry or proposal pending on the

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute or similar Law shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Company, Merger Subs, Parent and Blockers and their respective board of
directors (or equivalent governing body) shall, and the Company and the
Blockers shall cause their respective Affiliates to, grant such approvals and
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions

Closing: (i) the Company and the Blockers shall promptly, upon obtaining
knowledge of the following, advise Parent orally and in writing of any breach
of the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ and of any
other fact or event that would cause or constitute a breach of the covenants

which would result in any condition set forth in _Article VII_ not being
satisfied and (ii) Parent shall promptly, upon obtaining knowledge of the
following, advise the Company of any breach of the representations and

ARTICLE VIII

  


 

  

 _OTHER COVENANTS_

  


 

  

8.1 _Tax Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local, foreign and other Transfer
Taxes applicable to, imposed upon or arising out of the Merger shall be borne
one hundred percent (100%) by Parent; provided that any Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the GB Restructuring shall be borne by GB Holdco.
Parent shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to such Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, the
Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  


 

  

(b) Reserved

  


 

  

 

82  

  


 

  

(c) _Straddle Period_. With respect to any Taxes (and associated refunds,
credits or reductions in Tax liability) imposed with respect to a Straddle
Period:

  


 

  

(i) if such Taxes are imposed on a periodic or annual basis (e.g., property
Taxes), the amount of such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during such Straddle
Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and

  


 

  

(ii) in all other cases, the amount of such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be computed (A) as if such Straddle Period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date and, (B) in the case of any Taxes
attributable to ownership of any equity interest in an entity that is a
partnership for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes or a "controlled foreign
corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code or any comparable
state, local or foreign Law), as if the taxable period of such partnership or
controlled foreign corporation ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

  


 

  

(d) _Tax Return Preparation_.

  


 

  

(i) The Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Flow-Through
Tax Returns with respect to taxable periods ending before the Closing Date
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (taking into account
extensions) in a manner consistent with past practices of the relevant Group
Company. The Representative shall provide to Parent for review and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (as duly extended) therefor
drafts of all such Flow-Through Tax Returns prepared by the Representative.
The Representative shall incorporate any reasonable comments received at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns from Parent with
respect to such Flow-Through Tax Returns prepared by the Representative, and
Parent shall file, or cause to be filed, such Flow-Through Tax Returns as
revised. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be
required to file any Tax Return if Parent determines, in its sole discretion
exercised in good faith, that filing such Tax Return is reasonably likely to
expose Parent to any criminal penalties or monetary sanctions.

  


 

  

(ii) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Flow-Through Tax Returns with respect to taxable periods ending on
or after the Closing Date (taking into account extensions) in a manner
consistent with past practices of the relevant Group Company. Parent shall
provide to the Representative for review and approval (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) at least thirty (30)
days prior to the due date (as duly extended) therefor drafts of all such
Flow-Through Tax Returns prepared by Parent. Prior to filing, Parent shall
incorporate any reasonable comments received from the Representative at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns with respect to
such Flow-Through Tax Returns prepared by Parent. Following the conclusion of
a taxable year in which the

  


 

  

 

83  

  


 

  

Closing occurs, the Surviving Company shall provide each Person who was one of
its members during such taxable year, within the time permitted under
applicable Law (taking into account extensions), but in any case no later than
ninety (90) days after December 31, 2018, a Schedule K-1 for such taxable year
and such other information as such Person may reasonably request in connection
with the filing of his, her or its U.S. federal and state income tax returns
for such taxable year.

  


 

  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, all income Tax deductions attributable to
the payment of Company Transaction Expenses, Company Debt or the Blocker Debt
Amount (it being understood that the seventy percent (70%) safe harbor set
forth in Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-1 C.B. 746, shall be applied to any
"success-based fees" as described therein) shall be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted under applicable Law, including for
purposes of (A) calculating the Blocker Tax Amount and the Blocker Tax
Deductions hereunder and (B) reporting such income Tax deductions upon any Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies.

  


 

  

(e) _Tax Contests_. Parent and the Representative shall jointly control any
Tax examination, audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding (a "
_Tax Contest_ ") of a Flow-Through Tax Return of each Group Company with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date); _provided_ , that with respect to any such
Tax Contests, neither Party shall agree to any settlement of such Tax Contest
without the other Party's consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ _further_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt Parent shall have sole control over all matters in such Tax
Contest relating solely to the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(f) _Tax Characterization_. The Parties agree that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (i) the Company Merger shall be treated as a taxable sale of
partnership interests by the Company Securityholders (other than the
Blockers), and (ii) each of the Blocker Mergers shall be treated as (x) a
redemption by each of the Blockers of a portion of the Blocker
Securityholders' equity in such Blocker in exchange for securities of the
corresponding GB BlockerCo, followed by (y) a taxable sale by the Blocker
Securityholders of the remainder of such equity in the Blocker to Parent (or
its Affiliate), in each case consistent with Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Ruling 79-273, 1979-2 C.B. 125, and the Parties agree to report the Company
Merger and the Blocker Mergers consistently with such treatment for all Tax
purposes. Within ninety (90) Business Days after the Final Determination Date,
the Representative shall deliver to Parent a schedule setting forth the
allocation of the purchase price (and liabilities) among the assets of the
Company that complies with Sections 751 and 755 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). The
Parties agree that the Purchase Price Allocation shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the allocation methodology set forth in _Exhibit I_. If Parent
objects to the Purchase Price Allocation within thirty (30) days after receipt
thereof from the Representative, then Parent and the Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve promptly any such objection. If Parent and
the Representative do not resolve the objection within thirty (30) days after
Parent has so objected, then the dispute shall be resolved by the Accounting
Firm in accordance with the procedural principles of _Section 3.7(f)_ and this
_Section 8.1(d)_. The Parties shall update the Purchase Price Allocation to
reflect any further adjustments to the purchase price in a manner

  


 

  

 

84  

  


 

  

consistent with the principles used to create the Purchase Price Allocation.
The Parties agree to prepare all Tax Returns and to report all items for all
Tax purposes consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation as finalized under
this _Section 8.1(d)_.

  


 

  

(g) _Cooperation_. Parent and the Representative shall reasonably cooperate in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns and conducting Tax Contests in respect of
the Acquired Companies, including maintaining and making available to each
other all records necessary in connection with such Taxes and in resolving all
disputes and audits or defending any claim or assessment relating to such
Taxes. The Party requesting such cooperation shall pay the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of the other Parties paid to third parties.

  


 

  

(h) _No Section 338 Elections_. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
(or, from and after the Closing, shall cause or permit a Surviving Blocker to)
make an election under Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code with respect to
the Blocker Mergers.

  


 

  

(i) _Allocations_. The Parties agree that the income, gain, deductions and
losses of the Company attributable to the Company Securities (other than
Company Securities held by the Blockers) for the taxable year in which the
Closing occurs shall be divided and allocated between the Company
Securityholders and Parent (or its Affiliate) by taking into account their
varying interests during such taxable year in accordance with Section 706(d)
of Code using the interim "closing of the books" method.

  


 

  

8.2 _Access to Information_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent, the Surviving Blockers and the
Surviving Company shall afford (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to afford) the Representative, the Securityholders and their respective
Affiliates reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books and
records of Parent and the Acquired Companies (and shall permit such Persons to
examine and copy such books and records to the extent reasonably requested by
such party) and shall cause their Affiliates to furnish all information
reasonably requested by the Representative, the Securityholders or their
respective Affiliates relating to the ownership or operations of the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to
_Section 10.17_, nothing in this _Section 8.2(a)_ shall require Parent, the
Surviving Blockers or the Surviving Company to furnish to the Representative,
the Securityholders or their respective Affiliates any materials prepared by
the Surviving Blocker or the Surviving Company's financial or legal advisors
which is subject to an attorney-client privilege or an attorney work product
privilege or which may not be disclosed pursuant to applicable Law. For a
period of six (6) years following the Closing, or such longer period as may be
required by applicable Law or necessitated by applicable statutes of
limitations, Parent shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, maintain
all such books and records in the jurisdiction in which such books and records
were located prior to the Closing Date and shall not destroy or dispose of any
such books and records. On and after the end of such period, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, provide the Representative with at
least ten (10) Business Days prior written notice before destroying any such
books and records, during which period the Representative may elect to take
possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.

  


 

  

 

85

expense, of such books and records.

  


 

  

8.3 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the exculpation,
indemnification and expense advance and reimbursement provisions contained in
the Acquired Companies' Organizational Documents limiting the personal
liability of directors and officers for damages, shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would make any of such
provisions less favorable to the directors or officers of the Acquired
Companies than pertain to such directors or officers on the date of this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, from the Closing Date and for a
period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Parent and the Acquired
Companies shall (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_") from and against, and pay or reimburse the DandO
Indemnified Parties for, all losses, obligations, expenses, claims, damages or
liabilities (whether or not resulting from third party claims and including
interest, penalties, out-of-pocket expenses and attorneys' fees incurred in
the investigation or defense of any of the same or in asserting any of their
rights hereunder) resulting from, arising out or relating to their services as
directors, officers or employees of the Acquired Companies, whether asserted
or claimed at or after or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent
permitted or required under (A) applicable Law or (B) the Acquired Companies'
Organizational Documents, including provisions relating to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, and (ii) advance to
any DandO Indemnified Parties expenses incurred in defending any action or suit
with respect to such matters, in each case to the extent such DandO Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under the
Acquired Companies' Organizational Documents in effect on the date of this
Agreement and subject to the terms of such Organizational Documents;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or
made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of
each such claim shall continue until final disposition of such claim.

  


 

  

(b) Parent and the Acquired Companies hereby acknowledge that the DandO
Indemnified Parties have or may, in the future, have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by other
entities and/or organizations (collectively, the " _Other Indemnitors_ " and,
individually, an " _Other Indemnitor_ "). Parent and the

  


 

  

 

86  

  


 

  

Acquired Companies hereby agree that, with respect to any advancement or
indemnification obligation owed, at any time, to a DandO Indemnified Party by
Parent, the Acquired Companies, the Representative or any Other Indemnitor,
whether pursuant to any certificate of incorporation, by-laws, partnership
agreement, operating agreement, indemnification agreement or other document or
agreement and/or pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ (any of the foregoing is
herein an " _Indemnification Agreement_ "), Parent and the Acquired Companies
(i) shall at all times, be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its
obligations to a DandO Indemnified Party shall be primary and any obligation of
the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for
the same expenses or liabilities incurred by a DandO Indemnified Party shall be
secondary), (ii) shall at all times be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by a DandO Indemnified Party and shall be liable for the full
amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement (to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of
this Agreement or any Indemnification Agreement), without regard to any rights
that a DandO Indemnified Party may have against the Other Indemnitors, and (iii)
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any
and all claims (A) against the Other Indemnitors for contribution,
subrogation, indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof and (B) that the DandO Indemnified Party must seek expense advancement
or reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Other Indemnitor before Parent
and the Acquired Companies must perform their expense advancement and
reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this Agreement. Parent
and the Acquired Companies hereby further agree that no advancement,
indemnification or other payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of a DandO
Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for which a DandO Indemnified Party
has sought indemnification from Parent or the Acquired Companies shall affect
the foregoing, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution
and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement, indemnification or
other payment to all of the rights of recovery of such DandO Indemnified Party
against Parent or the Company, and Parent or the Acquired Companies shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless against such amounts
actually paid by the Other Indemnitors to or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified
Party to the extent such amounts would have otherwise been payable by Parent
or the Acquired Companies to a DandO Indemnified Party.

  


 

  

(c) If following the Closing, Parent, the Surviving Blockers, the Surviving
Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) reorganizes or consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is
not the resulting, continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
reorganization, consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person
or Persons, then, and in such case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Blocker or the Surviving
Company assume all of the obligations of Parent, the Surviving Blocker or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, as set forth in this _Section 8.3_.

  


 

  

(d) Immediately prior to the Closing, Parent shall purchase, from an insurer
chosen by the Company, a single payment, run-off policy of directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering current and former officers and
directors of any Acquired Company, the material terms of which, including
coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to the DandO
Indemnified Parties than the policy in effect as of the date hereof, such

  


 

  

 

87  

  


 

  

policy to become effective at the Closing and remain in effect for a period of
six (6) years after the Closing.

  


 

  

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, pay all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, which may be incurred by any DandO
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity or other obligations in this
_Section 8.3_.

  


 

  

(f) This _Section 8.3_ is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third
party rights to, the DandO Indemnified Parties and the Other Indemnitors under
this _Section 8.3_ and the benefits of the exculpation, indemnification and
expense advance and reimbursement provisions contained in the Acquired
Companies' Organizational Documents, whether or not parties to this Agreement,
and each of such Persons shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained
herein.

  


 

  

8.4 _Employee Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing, Parent
shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each GM Employee
who continues as an employee of the Surviving Company or Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") with (i) base salary, wage and cash incentive compensation
opportunities at a rate not less than the rate of such Continuing Employee's
base salary, wage and cash incentive compensation opportunities in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits (including
retirement, severance, vacation and welfare benefits but excluding the value
of equity compensation) that are no less favorable than those provided to such
Continuing Employee under the Employee Benefit Plans as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing, _provided_ that to the extent that any such benefits are
provided to a Continuing Employee following the Closing pursuant to an
Employee Benefit Plan sponsored by a member of the GB Group, the benefits
thereunder shall be deemed to be no less favorable than immediately prior to
the Closing.

  


 

  

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to cause any employee benefit
policies or plans (including in each case with respect to severance benefits,
but excluding equity compensation) covering the Continuing Employees following
the Closing (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the
service of each Continuing Employee with an Acquired Company for all purposes
of vesting, eligibility to participate, vacation entitlement, severance and
all other benefit entitlements (but not for benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan), except to the extent such service credit would result
in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to (i) waive any pre-existing condition
limitations and waiting periods to the extent waived or not applicable under,
or previously satisfied by such Continuing Employee under, the relevant
Employee Benefit Plan, and (ii) cause the Continuing Employees to be given
credit under the applicable Post-Closing Plan for amounts paid prior to the
date on which such Continuing Employees commence participation in such Post-
Closing Plan during the plan year in which such participation commences under
a corresponding Employee Benefit Plan during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Post-
Closing Plan.

  


 

  

 

88

and welfare benefit plans, programs and policies which, at such time, are
sponsored by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent
Welfare Plans_ ") and will no longer be eligible to participate in the GB
Holdco Welfare Plans, at which time Parent and its Subsidiaries will be liable
for all claims incurred by the Continuing Employees under the Parent Welfare
Plans, _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Continuing Employee
who is a U.S. Leave of Absence Employee, such Continuing Employee will not
become eligible to participate in the Parent Welfare Plans until the Hire

10.9 _Governing Law; Submission of Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial;
Selection of Forum_.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement, and all Proceedings (whether in contract or tort, at law
or in equity or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware; _provided_ that any suit, action or other proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Lender or any

  


 

  

 

104  

  


 

  

Lender Related Party arising out of or relating to (x) the Debt Financing or
(y) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will, except as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters,
be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State
of New York applicable to agreements executed and performed entirely within
such State without regard to conflicts of law principles of the State of New
York or any other jurisdiction that would cause the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York to apply.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably agrees that all Proceedings (whether
in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) shall be exclusively resolved in any federal or state court sitting
in Delaware, (ii) irrevocably agrees service of process, summons, notice or
document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided in _Section 10.8_ shall be effective service of process against it
for any such Proceeding brought in any such court, and (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such court. Each of
the Parties hereby agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties hereby agrees that it will
not bring, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring, any suit, action or other
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Lender or any Lender Related
Party arising out of or relating to (x) the Debt Financing or (y) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
forum other than a state or federal court sitting in New York County, New

or other proceeding.

  


 

  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
PROCEEDING (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY OR OTHERWISE)
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE DEBT FINANCING,
INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING THAT INVOLVES EITHER PARTY'S
REPRESENTATIVES.

  


 

  

10.10 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
Parent, the Company and the Representative. There shall be no amendment of any
provision of this Agreement that by Law requires further approval by the
Securityholders without the further approval of the Securityholders. No waiver
by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party making such waiver, nor

  


 

  

 

105  

  


 

  

shall such waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence;
_provided_ that this _Section 10.10_ and _Section 9.2_, _10.3_ , _10.4_ ,
_10.9(a)_ , _10.9(b)_ , _10.9(c)_ and _10.16_ (in each case, together with any
related definitions and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a
modification or termination would serve to modify the substance or provisions

in a manner that is adverse to the Lenders or the Lender Related Parties
without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

  


 

  

10.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the

validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

  


 

  

10.12 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

  


 

  

10.13 _Incorporation of Exhibits,_ _Schedules and Disclosure Letter_. The
Exhibits, Schedules and Disclosure Letter identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

  


 

  

10.14 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Parties agree that (a) irreparable damage would occur in the
event that the provisions of this Agreement or obligations, undertakings,
covenants or agreements of the Parties were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and (b) money damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or
any breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, it is agreed that the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in any court specified in _Section 10.9_ without proof
of actual damages or any requirement to post a bond, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and each
Party agrees that it shall not oppose (and hereby waives any defense in any
action for) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law, in equity or otherwise. Without
limitation of the foregoing, the Parties hereby further acknowledge and agree
that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to
prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed by Parent
and Merger Sub under this Agreement, and including to cause Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments
contemplated by this Agreement, including _Article III_ in addition to any
other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, including
the Company's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and
seek money damages (including damages based on loss of the economic benefits
of the Merger to the Securityholders).

  


 

  

 

106  

  


 

  

10.15 _Representative_.

  


 

  

(a) The Representative is hereby irrevocably appointed as the representative,
agent, proxy, and attorney-in-fact for all the Securityholders for all
purposes under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Payment Agent
Agreement, including the full power and authority on the Securityholders'
behalf: (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
and the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith, (ii) to negotiate and settle disputes arising
under, or relating to, this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments,
and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (iii) to
receive and disburse to the Securityholders any funds received on behalf of
the Securityholders under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Payment
Agent Agreement or otherwise, (iv) to withhold any amounts received on behalf
of the Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
including the Representative Holdback Amount, or otherwise to satisfy any and
all obligations or liabilities incurred by the Securityholders or the
Representative in the performance of their duties hereunder, (v) to direct the
distribution of funds, designate or engage a paying agent to distribute funds
(including the Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration, the Adjustment Amount,
if any, payable in accordance with _Section 3.7_ and funds from the Escrow
Account and the Representative Holdback Amount), make or direct payments of
funds from the Representative Holdback Amount, give receipts for funds,
authorize deliveries to Parent of cash from the Escrow Account in satisfaction
of claims asserted by Parent and object to any claims by any Person against
the Escrow Account, (vi) to execute and deliver any amendment or waiver to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Payment Agent Agreement and the
other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed
in connection herewith (without the prior approval of the Securityholders) and
(vii) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of the
Securityholders in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Payment Agent Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith. The
Securityholders, by approving this Agreement (whether by vote or by execution
of a Letter of Transmittal), further agree that such agency and proxy are
coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Securityholder. All decisions and actions by
the Representative shall be binding upon all of the Securityholders and no
Securityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same. The Representative shall not have the authority to increase
the Liability of any Securityholder on a non pro rata basis. If an allocation
is not otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Representative shall
distribute funds to the Securityholders in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Share. Parent may conclusively rely, without independent verification
or investigation, upon any such decision or action of the Representative as
being the binding decision or action of every Securityholder, and Parent shall
not be liable to any Securityholder or any other Persons for any actions taken
or omitted from being taken by them or by Parent in accordance with or
reliance upon any such decision or action of the Representative. The
Representative shall have no duties or obligations to the Securityholders
hereunder, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. By its approval
of, or consent to, the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement, its
acceptance of any consideration pursuant to this Agreement or delivery of a
Letter of Transmittal, each Securityholder hereby irrevocably approves and
adopts the appointment of the Representative as such Securityholder's
representative, agent, proxy, and attorney-in-fact.

  


 

  

 

107  

  

  

(b) By the approval of this Agreement, each Securityholder hereby severally,
for itself only and not jointly, and up to its Pro Rata Share, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Representative and its partners, managers,
officers, agents and other representatives against all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts incurred by such
Persons in connection with any Proceeding to which the Representative or such
other Person is made a party by reason of the fact that it is or was acting as
the Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, other than as a
result of the Representative's bad faith or willful misconduct.

  


 

  

(c) Neither the Representative nor any of its members, managers, officers,
agents or other representatives shall incur any Liability to any
Securityholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of such Persons for any
reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of their duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting bad faith or willful misconduct. The Representative and its
members, managers, officers, agents and other representatives shall have no
Liability in respect of any Proceeding brought against such Persons by any
Securityholder, regardless of the legal theory under which such Liability may
be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at
law or in equity, or otherwise, unless such Persons took or omitted taking any
action in bad faith or as result of willful misconduct.

  


 

  

(d) The Representative shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
recover from any amounts withheld by the Representative, including the
Representative Holdback Amount, its reasonable and documented out‑of‑pocket
expenses incurred in the performance of its duties hereunder (the " _Charges_
"). In the event the Representative Holdback Amount is insufficient to satisfy
such deficit, each Securityholder will be obligated to pay any remaining
unpaid amounts to the Representative on a several, and not joint, basis, up to
each such Securityholder's Pro Rata Share.

  


 

  

(e) In furtherance of, and without limiting any rights of the Representative
set forth in _Sections 10.15(a)(iv)_ , _10.15(a)(v)_ and _Section 10.15(d)_,
the Representative shall have the right, and the Securityholders hereby
authorize the Representative, to withhold from the Closing Date Merger
Consideration the Representative Holdback Amount (in connection with the
allocation and distribution of the Closing Date Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Article III_ ) to satisfy potential future obligations of the
Securityholders and expenses incurred by the Representative in connection with
performing its obligations under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Representative Holdback Amount shall be retained by the Representative until
such time as the Representative shall determine, and, subject to the terms of
this Agreement, the balance of the Representative Holdback Amount, if any,
shall be delivered by the Representative or a paying agent designated by the
Representative to the Securityholders as if such amounts were being
distributed pursuant to _Section 3.8(a)(i)(1)_. The Securityholders will not
receive any interest or earnings on the Representative Holdback Amount and
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Representative any ownership right that
they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the
Representative Holdback Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Representative Holdback Amount shall be held in an
FDIC-insured account or accounts at a nationally recognized financial
institution.

  


 

  

 

108  

  

  

(f) Following the Closing Date, a majority‑in‑interest of the Securityholders
may, by written consent, appoint a new representative as the Representative.
Notice, together with a copy of the written consent appointing such new
representative and bearing the signatures of a majority‑in‑interest of the
Securityholders, must be delivered to Parent not less than ten (10) days prior
to such appointment. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the
date indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by Parent.

  


 

  

(g) In the event that the Representative becomes unable or unwilling to
continue in its capacity as Representative, or if the Representative resigns
as the Representative, a majority‑in‑interest of the Securityholders may by
written consent appoint a new representative as the Representative; provided
that any such resignation by the Representative shall not be effective until
the appointment of a new representative as the Representative. Notice and a
copy of the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the
signatures of a majority‑in‑interest of the Securityholders must be delivered
to Parent. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by Parent.

  


 

  

10.16 _Non-Recourse_. Except as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement,
(a) this Agreement may be enforced only against, and any Proceeding based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be brought only against, the entities that are
expressly named as Parties and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party and (b) with respect
to each Party, no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor, lender or representative of such named Party shall have any Liability
(whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, or based upon
any theory that seeks to impose Liability of an entity party against its
owners or Affiliates) for any one or more of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of such named Party
or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The provisions of this _Section 10.16_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by the Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, incorporators, members, partners,
stockholders, agents, attorneys and other representatives referenced in this
_Section 10.16_ and each such Person shall be a third party beneficiary of
this _Section 10.16_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Lender or Lender Related Party shall have any Liability (whether in contract
or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
Liability of an entity party against its owners or affiliates) to the Acquired
Companies, GB Holdco, the Representative or any Company Representative for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to the
Debt Financing or this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of the Debt Financing or this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance thereof; and each Company Representative waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any Lender or
any Lender Related Party.

  

  

10.17 _Provision With Respect to Legal Representation_. Each of the Parties
hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that (a) Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP may serve as counsel to the Representative and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Acquired Companies, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement,

  


 

  

 

109  

  


 

  

the other documents referred to herein and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other documents referred
to herein, and (b) following consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP may serve as counsel to the Representative
and any manager, director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of
the Representative, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (any such representation, the " _Post-Closing
Representation_ "), notwithstanding such representation. Each of the Parties
hereby does, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, consent to the
foregoing arrangements and irrevocably waive (and will not assert) any actual
or potential conflict of interest or any objection that may arise from any
representation by Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP expressly permitted hereunder
(notwithstanding the fact that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP may have
represented, and may currently or in the future represent, Parent and/or any
of its Affiliates (including any portfolio companies) or representatives with
respect to matters unrelated to this Agreement, the other documents referred
to herein and the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the other
documents referred to herein). The Parties acknowledge that the foregoing
provision applies whether or not Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP provides legal
services to the Surviving Blockers, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Each of the Parties, on their own behalf
and on behalf of their directors, members, officers employees and Affiliates,
and each of their successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that all communications between the Representative and its counsel and
the Acquired Companies and its counsel, including Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP,
made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any Proceeding arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by any of the foregoing, or any matter relating to any of the
foregoing, are privileged communications between such Party and such counsel
and from and after the Closing do not pass to Parent, the Surviving Blockers
or the Surviving Company notwithstanding the Merger and instead survive,
remain with and are controlled by the Representative (the " _Privileged
Communications_ "), without any waiver thereof. Neither the Surviving
Blockers, the Surviving Company, nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of
or through Parent, the Surviving Blockers or the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates, will seek to obtain the same by any process. Parent, the
Surviving Blockers and the Surviving Company, together with any of their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that no
Person may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications, whether
located in the records or email accounts of any Acquired Company, the
Surviving Blockers or the Surviving Company, or otherwise (including in the
knowledge of their officers and employees), in any action against or involving
any of the Parties after the Closing. Parent, the Surviving Blockers and the
Surviving Company agree not to assert that the privilege has been waived as to
the Privileged Communications that may be located in the records or email
server (or in the knowledge of the officers and employees) of any Acquired
Company, the Surviving Blockers or the Surviving Company. From and after the
Closing, each of Parent and the Surviving Company, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with
respect to any communication between Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP and the
Acquired Companies occurring prior to the Closing in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation. Parent acknowledges that the Company and Weil, Gotshal
and Manges LLP will be relying on the waiver provided hereby and that this
_Section 10.17_ is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third party
rights to Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP to enforce this _Section 10.17_. Parent
further

  


 

  

 

110  

  


 

  

acknowledges that its consent and waiver under this _Section 10.17_ is
voluntary and informed, and that it has obtained independent legal advice with
respect to this consent and waiver. This _Section 10.17_ shall amend, restate
and supersede any other conflict waiver entered by Parent or one of its
Affiliates in favor of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any such conflict
waiver in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  


 

  

10.18 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or by PDF file (portable
document format file)), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

  


    

 

111  

  

  

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement and Plan
of Merger as of the date first above written.
