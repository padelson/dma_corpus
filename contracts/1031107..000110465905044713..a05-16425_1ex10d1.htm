**Per Common Share Amount** ") in cash and without interest thereon (subject
to any applicable withholding tax), upon surrender of the corresponding
Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.10_.

  



  

(b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted.

  



  

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Stock_.
Each Treasury Share and each Share held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  



  

(d) _Cancellation and Retirement of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, all
Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall, to the extent
such certificate represents such Shares, cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except, in all cases other than Shares to be canceled
in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_, the right to receive the Per
Common Share Amount upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
_Section 2.10_.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Surrender of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
" **Paying Agent** ") in accordance with an agreement reasonably satisfactory
to the Company to receive the funds necessary to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 2.9_, and Parent shall, at or prior to the
Effective Time, deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this
_Article II_, cash in an amount sufficient to make payments of the Per
Common Share Amount upon surrender of Certificates (such cash consideration
being deposited hereinafter referred to as the " **Payment Fund** "). The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make payments out
of the Payment Fund as provided for in this _Article II_ and the Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. All expenses of the Paying
Agent shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures for Company Common Stock_.  As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall mail, or shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail, to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (collectively, the " **Certificates** ") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Shares (other than Shares held by Parent,
Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of
transmittal (a " **Letter of Transmittal** ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Per Common Share Amount.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation,
together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed, and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
by check an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Common Share
Amount for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate. Such payment
of the Per Common Share Amount shall be sent to such holder by the Paying
Agent promptly after receipt by the Paying Agent of such
Certificate, together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed, and such
other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
and the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. The right of any stockholder to receive the Per
Common Share Amount, shall be subject to and reduced by any applicable
withholding obligation as set forth in _Section 2.14_. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable upon the surrender of a Certificate.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock_.  Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.10_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Per Common Share Amount in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Section 2.10_.
All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented by
such Certificates. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company, and if
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this _Article II_.

  



  

(d) _Unregistered Transfer of Capital Stock_. If payment of the Per Common
Share Amount is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of such
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and any other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is
not applicable.

  



  

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Common Share
Amount payable pursuant to this _Article II_.

  



  

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid as directed by Parent.
To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, Parent
shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost
through investments so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is maintained at a
level sufficient to make such payments.

  



  

(g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the former holders of Company Common Stock one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand. Any such
holders who have not complied with this _Article II_ prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent, and Parent shall thereafter be liable,
for payment of the Per Common Share Amount (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and similar Laws). Any such portion of the Payment Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Persons
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  



  

Section 2.11 _Stock Options_.

  



  

(a) _Stock Options_.

  



  

(i) Each Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " **Current Option** "), other than the Cancelled Stock
Options shall be converted as of the Effective Time into an option to
acquire, on substantially similar terms and conditions applicable to such
Current Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for the
adjustments provided herein), the number of shares of common stock, rounded
to the nearest whole share, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "
**Parent Common Stock** "), that is equal to the product, rounded to the
nearest whole share, of (i) the number of Shares subject to such Current
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Option
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal
to the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole cent, of (x) the exercise
price per Share applicable under such Current Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (each Current Option,
as so adjusted, an " **Adjusted Stock Option** "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing adjustments shall comply with Section 424(a) of the
Code.

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

(ii) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Current Option that
(x) is vested (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting due to
consummation of the Merger provided for under the terms of the applicable
Equity Compensation Plan or employment agreement as in effect on the date
hereof or as modified to reflect the proposed changes set forth in Section
5.1(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or (y) is subject to the laws of a
non-U.S. jurisdiction and/or held by an employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and which Parent
determines may not be converted into an Adjusted Stock Option under _Section
2.11(a) _(1) under the applicable laws or regulatory requirements of the
relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction (including by reason of a failure to obtain
any required consents or approvals after making reasonable commercial
efforts) or (2) under the generally applicable policies and practices of
Parent with respect to the grant of equity awards in the relevant non-U.S.
jurisdiction (each such Current Option, a " **Cancelled Stock Option**
") shall be cancelled and in lieu thereof, the holder of each such Cancelled
Stock Option will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any of the Per
Common Share Amount over the exercise price per Share under such Cancelled
Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
Cancelled Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, without
interest (the " **Option Consideration** "), reduced by any income or
employment taxes required to be withheld under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law.

  



  

(b) _Performance Units_. As of the Effective Time, each Performance Unit
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
**Current Performance Unit** ") that, pursuant to the terms thereof described
in Section 5.1(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, is or becomes vested in
connection with the satisfaction of applicable performance thresholds and is
granted upon consummation of the Merger shall be cancelled in exchange for
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per
Share Common Amount, reduced by any income or employment taxes required to be
withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
All Current Performance Units that are not vested or granted in accordance
with the preceding sentence shall automatically be cancelled at the Effective
Time for no consideration.

  



  

(c) _Restricted Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each Restricted Share
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
**Current Restricted Share")**  shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive, at the Effective Time, the Per Common Share Amount, without
interest, reduced by any income or employment taxes required to be withheld
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.

  



  

(d) _Amendment and Administration of Equity Arrangements_.  As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and conditional
upon the Closing, the Company (and its board of directors) shall take all
requisite actions and/or adopt such resolutions as may be required in order
to give effect to and accomplish the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 2.11_, including, without limitation, amending each of the Equity
Compensation Plans (i) if and to the extent necessary and practicable, to
reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not
limited to, the adjustment of the Current Options pursuant to _Section
2.11(a)(i) _and the cancellation of the Cancelled Stock Options, Current
Performance Units and Current Restricted Shares pursuant to clauses (a)(ii),
(b) and (c)

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

of this _Section 2.11_ and (ii) to preclude any discretionary, automatic or
formulaic grant of any Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Performance Units or
other equity-based awards thereunder on or after the date hereto except as
permitted pursuant to _Section 5.1(b) _hereof.

  



  

(e) _Withholding Taxes_. In accordance with this _Section 2.11_, the
Surviving Corporation will promptly pay or cause to be paid any
amounts withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.11_ for applicable
foreign, federal, state and local taxes to the appropriate Governmental
Entity on behalf of such holders of the applicable Cancelled Stock Options,
Restricted Shares and/or Performance Units.

  



  

(f) _Actions by Parent_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement and conditional upon the Closing, Parent (and its
board of directors) shall take all requisite actions and/or adopt such
resolutions necessary to authorize Parent to, convert all of the Current
Options, other than the Cancelled Options, in accordance with _Section
2.11(a)_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the holders of Adjusted Stock Options appropriate documents
setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant to the applicable equity
compensation plan and the Adjusted Stock Options shall continue in effect on
substantially the same terms and conditions (subject to changes in accordance
with this _Section 2.11_ and after giving effect to the Merger).

  



  

(g) _Reservation of Parent Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Adjusted Stock Options assumed in accordance with this _Section 2.11_.
To the extent necessary, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Adjusted Stock Options and shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Adjusted Stock Options remain outstanding.

  



  

Section 2.12 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly
demanded and perfected appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
**Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the applicable Per Common Share Amount but instead shall be
entitled to receive such payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Dissenting Shares as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holderÂ’s
right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, each such Share held by such
holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the Per Common Share Amount in accordance with
_Section 2.9(a)_, and such Share shall no longer be a Dissenting Share.
The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisals of any Shares and attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be
paid the "fair

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, and
Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisals of Shares, offer to settle or settle
any demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.13 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares shall be changed into a different number, class or series
of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, then the
Per Common Share Amount payable with respect thereto and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

Section 2.14 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger any amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld under the Code, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
 To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares or Stock Options in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

# **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

Except, with respect to any Section of this _Article III_, as set forth in
the section of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the " **Company Disclosure Schedule** ") that
specifically relates to such Section or in another section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the text of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such Section, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

Section 3.1 _Organization and Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. Each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
respective organization (to the extent the "good standing" concept is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States).  Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently
being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties
and assets. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (to the extent the "good standing" concept is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of (a) the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or other constituent
documents,

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

as amended to date, of the Company and (b) the minutes (or, in the case of
draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the
stockholders, the boards of directors of the Company and each committee of
the board of directors of the Company other than the Special Committee held
since August 7, 2003. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other applicable
constituent documents, except for such violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Subsidiaries_.

interest in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) have been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all Liens and free
of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting
interest) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of
such SubsidiaryÂ’s business as presently conducted.

  



  

(c) There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
options, warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements to acquire from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or that obligate the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of
the Company, (iii) obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter into
any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or
other similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, any
Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together
with the capital stock of the Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred
to collectively as " **Subsidiary Securities** ") or (iv) other obligations
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the
price or value of any shares of any Subsidiary of the Company. There are no
outstanding agreements of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding
Subsidiary Securities.

Section 3.3 _Authorization_. The Company has all requisite power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and subject, in the case

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company and no additional corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, other than in the case of the
consummation of the Merger to obtaining the Stockholder Approval. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (a) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (b) is subject to general principles of
equity.

rights of first refusal or similar rights with respect to any securities of

Section 3.5 _Non-contravention; Required Consents_.

  



  

(a) The execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement,
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and

or Liens which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

registration with, or notification to (any of the foregoing being a "

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports_. The Company has filed all forms, reports and
documents with the SEC that have from and after August 7, 2003 been required
to be filed by it (such forms, reports and documents, together with the
CompanyÂ’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2003, the " **SEC Reports** "). Each SEC Report complied, as of its
filing date, as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
each as in effect on the date such SEC Report was filed, except as disclosed
in any such SEC Report. True and correct copies of all Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date hereof, whether or not required under applicable
Laws, have been furnished to Parent or are publicly available in the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the
SEC. As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseded
filing), each SEC Report did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is required to
file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. No executive officer
of the Company has failed to make the certifications required of him or her
under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any SEC
Report, except as disclosed in certifications filed with the SEC Reports.

Law), termination, retention, change of control and other similar fringe,
welfare or other employee benefit plans, programs, agreement, contracts,
policies or arrangements (whether or not in writing) maintained or
contributed to for the benefit of or relating to any current or former
employee or director of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other
trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which would be treated as a
single employer with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Section
414 of the Code (an " **ERISA Affiliate** "), or with respect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any material Liability (together the "
**Employee Plans** "). With respect to each Employee Plan, the Company has
made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of (i) the most recent
annual report on Form 5500 required to have been filed with the Internal
Revenue Service for each Employee Plan, including all schedules thereto; (ii)
the most recent determination letter, if any, from the Internal Revenue
Service for any Employee Plan that is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code; (iii) the plan documents and summary plan descriptions,
if any (other than those referred to in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), or a
written description of the terms of any Employee Plan that is not in writing;
(iv) any related trust agreements, insurance contracts, insurance policies or
other documents of any funding arrangements; (v) any notices to or from the
Internal Revenue Service or any office or representative of the Department of
Labor or any similar Governmental Entity relating to any compliance issues in
respect of any such Employee Plan; (vi) with respect to each Employee Plan
that is maintained in any non-U.S. jurisdiction (the " **International
Employee Plans** "), to the extent applicable, (A) the most recent annual
report or similar compliance documents required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity with respect to such plan and (B) any document comparable
to the determination letter reference under clause (ii) above issued by a
Governmental Entity relating to the satisfaction of the requirements of Law
necessary to obtain the most favorable tax treatment; and (vii) all
amendments, modifications or supplements to any such document. No Employee
Plan is (i) a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414 of the Code),
(ii) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), (iii) a
"multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA) (in
each case under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) whether or not subject to ERISA) or
(iv) subject to Section 302 of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of
ERISA.

  



  

(b) Each Employee Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and with all applicable
Laws and Collective Bargaining Agreements, including the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and the codes of practice issued by any
Governmental Entity. To the extent applicable, each International Employee
Plan has been approved by the relevant taxation and other
Governmental Entities so as to enable: (i) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the participants and beneficiaries under the relevant
International Employee Plan; and (ii) in the case of any International
Employee Plan under which resources are set aside in advance of the benefits
being paid (a " **Funded International Employee Plan** "), the assets held
for the purposes of the Funded International Employee Plans, to enjoy the
most favorable taxation status possible and the Company is not aware of any
ground on which such approval may cease to apply.

  



  

(c) No Employee Plan that is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan or
arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code has been materially modified
(as defined under

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

Section 409A of the Code) since October 3, 2004 and all such non-qualified
deferred compensation plans or arrangements have been operated and
administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code from the
period beginning January 1, 2005 through the date hereof. All contributions,
premiums and other payments required to be made with respect to any Employee
Plan have been timely made under applicable Law, any applicable Collective
Bargaining Agreement and the terms of such Plan. To the knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred and there currently exists no condition or set
of circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries could be subject to any material liability under the terms of
any Employee Plan, ERISA, the Code or codes of practice issued by
any Governmental Entity, Collective Bargaining Agreement or any other
applicable Law. Except as required by Law, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any plan or commitment to amend or establish any new
Employee Plan or to continue or increase any benefits under any Employee
Plan, or to maintain any such benefits or the level of any such benefits
generally for any period.

  



  

(d) There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened on behalf of or against any Employee Plan, the assets of
any trust under any Employee Plan, or the plan sponsor, plan administrator or
any fiduciary or any Employee Plan with respect to the administration or
operation of such plans which would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(e) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents
has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any
non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975
of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which could reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of
ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each case applicable
to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee Plan or for which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnification obligation.

  



  

(f) No Employee Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA provides benefits to former employees of the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates, other than pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or
any similar state, local or foreign Law.

  



  

(g) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401
and/or 409 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service to such effect and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no fact, circumstance or event has occurred or exists since the date of such
determination letter that would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan.

  



  

(h) All contributions, premiums and other payments required to be made with
respect to any Employee Plan have been timely made, accrued or reserved for
in all material respects.

  



  

(i) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or
in conjunction with any

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

other event, (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or
required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value
of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided
to any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit
or compensation or (iv) result in any amount to fail to be deductible by
reason of Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

(j) Since August 1, 2003, no deduction for federal income tax purposes has
been nor is any such deduction expected by the Company to be disallowed for
remuneration paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of
Section 162(m) of the Code including by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(k) All contracts of employment with any employee of the Company or any of
it Subsidiaries who provide services outside the United States (" **Foreign
Employees** "), director or consultant can be terminated by three monthsÂ’
notice or less given at any time without giving rise to any claim for
damages, severance pay, or compensation (other than a statutory redundancy
payment applicable by virtue of Law or compensation for unfair dismissal
applicable by virtue of Law).

  



  

(l) No promise has been made to any Foreign Employee that his defined
contribution benefits under any Funded International Employee Plan will at
any point in the future equate to or not be less than any particular amount.
Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities, that as
of the Closing Date, will not be offset in full by insurance or otherwise be
fully accounted for on a basis which complies with International Accounting
Standard 19 ( _IAS 19_ ) (whether or not _IAS 19_  applies to the Company
or, if relevant, any of its Subsidiaries).

  



  

(m) Except as required by Law, no condition or term under any relevant
Employee Plan Document exists which would prevent Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from terminating or amending any
International Employee Plan at any time for any reason without liability to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for benefits).

  



  

Section 3.18 _Labor Matters_.

  



  

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any labor
or Collective Bargaining Agreement with respect to their respective employees
with any labor organization, union, group, association, works council or
other employee representative body. To the knowledge of the Company, there
are no activities or proceedings by any labor organization, union, group or
association or representative thereof to organize any such employees. There
are no lockouts, strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threats thereof by or with respect to any employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect nor have there been any such lockouts, strikes, slowdowns or
work stoppages since August 7, 2003.

  



  

32   

     
   

  



  

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) have complied in all material
respects with applicable Laws and Orders relating to the employment of labor
(including, without limitation, wage and hour Laws, Laws prohibiting
discrimination in employment and Laws relating to employee notification and
consultation, terms and conditions of employment practices and health and
safety at work of employees) and Collective Bargaining Agreements; and (ii)
are not liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any penalty for a
failure to comply with the foregoing. The Company and its Subsidiaries are
not liable to any Governmental Entity or fund governed or maintained by or on
behalf of any Governmental Entity for any material payment with respect to
any social security or other benefits or obligations for employees (save for
routine payments to be made in the normal course of business and consistent
with past practice).

  



  

Section 3.19 _Real Property_.

  



  

(a) _Owned Real Property_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
owns any real property.

  



  

(b) _Leased Real Property_. Section 3.19(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete list of all of the existing material leases,
subleases or other agreements (collectively, the " **Leases** ") under which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries uses or occupies or has the right to
use or occupy, now or in the future, any real property (such property, the "
**Leased Real Property** ") including, with respect to each Lease, the name
of the lessor and the date of the Lease and each amendment thereto. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of all Leases (including all modifications, amendments, supplements,
waivers and side letters thereto). The Company and/or its Subsidiaries have
and own valid leasehold estates in the Leased Real Property, free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances. Section 3.19(b)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all of the existing
Leases granting to any Person, other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any right to use or occupy, now or in the future, any of the
Leased Real Property. The Leases are each in full force and effect and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach of or
default under, or has received written notice of any material breach of or
default under, any material Lease, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute
a material breach or default thereunder by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other party thereto.

  



  

Section 3.20 _Assets; Personal Property_. The machinery, equipment,
furniture, fixtures and other tangible personal property and assets owned,
leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " **Assets** ")
are, in the aggregate, sufficient and adequate to carry on their respective
businesses in all material respects as presently conducted, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries are in possession of and have good title to, or valid
leasehold interests in or valid rights under contract to use, such Assets
that are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, free
and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances and defects in
title that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

Section 3.21 _Intellectual Property_.

  



  

(a) Sections 3.21(a)(i) and (a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth, respectively, (i) all products marketed by the Company or
its Subsidiaries since August 7, 2003 and (ii) all products that are
in development as of the date hereof (other than updates or upgrades to
existing products) and that the Company expects or intends to make
available commercially prior to twelve months after the date hereof (such
products described in clauses (i) and (ii), the " **Company Products** ");
provided that the Company makes no representation or warranty that all such
Company Products will in fact be made commercially available within twelve
months or ever or that there are no other products that may become available
in that time.

  



  

(b) Section 3.21(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of the following Owned Company IP: (i) all registered
Trademarks and material unregistered Trademarks; (ii) domain names
registrations; (iii) all Patents; and (iv) all registered Copyrights, in each
case listing, as applicable, (A) the name of the applicant/registrant and
current owner, (B) the jurisdiction where the application/registration is
located, and (C) the application or registration number. Section 3.21(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies, with respect to domain
names, the named owner, and the registrar or equivalent Person with whom that
domain name is registered. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Owned Company IP is invalid or unenforceable, except to the extent that such
invalidity or unenforceability would not, individually or in the aggregate,
give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c) In each case in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
acquired ownership of any registered Trademarks, registered Copyrights,
Patents, or domain name registrations currently included in the Owned Company
IP from another Person as set forth in Section 3.21(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (i) with respect to Patents,
registered Trademarks, or registered Copyrights, the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries has recorded or had recorded each such acquisition with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright Office, or their respective
equivalents in the applicable jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with
applicable Laws; and (ii) with respect to material domain names, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has made or procured a transfer of the domain name
in accordance with the procedure of the registrar, except in the case of
either clause (i) or (ii) where the failure to do so will not give rise to a
Company Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
representation relates only to Trademarks, Copyrights and domain names that
were registered and to Patents that had issued at the time that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries acquired them. Thus, for example, the foregoing
does not apply to inventions that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
acquires for which it later applies for patents in its own name, or to
copyrights or trademarks that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
initially registers in its own name.

  



  

(d) Section 3.21(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all
material agreements (other than any agreements that were terminated by the
Company or its Subsidiaries more than six months before the date hereof, or
that expired or were terminated by any party other than the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries before the date hereof, or that were rejected by the Company
in connection with the CompanyÂ’s bankruptcy filing on September 22, 2002) (i)
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries uses or has the right to
use any Licensed Company IP, other than licenses and related services
agreements for commercially available software that is used by the Company
but not incorporated into any Company Products

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

and that has not been substantially customized solely for use by Company, or
(ii) under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, after August 7,
2003, licensed to others the right to use or agreed to transfer to others any
of the Company IP, other than customer licenses and other agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business, in each case specifying the parties
to the agreement (such agreements, the " **Company IP Agreements** ").
Except as set forth in any of the Company IP Agreements, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted since August 7, 2003 nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, before that date, any exclusive license under any
Owned Company IP or any licenses to use any material Company Source Code
(other than source code licenses granted in connection with source code
escrows). To the knowledge of the Company, no third parties to the Company IP
Agreements are in material breach thereof, except where such breach would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no pending disputes
regarding the scope of such Company IP Agreements, performance under the
Company IP Agreements, or with respect to payments made or received under
such Company IP Agreements, except for disputes that will not, individually
or in the aggregate, give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of the Company, all Company IP Agreements are binding and are
in full force and effect, except where the failure of a Company IP Agreement
to be binding and in full force and effect would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, the Owned Company IP, together with
the Intellectual Property held or used under license by the Company and
its Subsidiaries, is sufficient for the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.  Without limiting the
foregoing, to the knowledge of the Company, the Company or its Subsidiaries
have the right to use all software development tools, library functions, or
compilers that the Company or its Subsidiaries (i) use to create, modify,
compile, or support any material Company Product, or (ii) use to provide any
material services provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries own all right, title and interest in the
Owned Company IP, free and clear of all Liens other than (i)
Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) encumbrances, restrictions or other obligations
arising under any of the Company IP Agreements, and (iii) Liens that do
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(g) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable and
appropriate steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of the Trade
Secrets that comprise any part of the Company IP, and to the knowledge of the
Company, there are no unauthorized uses, disclosures or infringements of any
such Trade Secrets by any Person. To the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, all use and
disclosure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Trade Secrets owned
by another Person have been pursuant to the terms of a written agreement with
such Person or was otherwise lawful, except to the extent that any use or
disclosure of any Trade Secret owned by another Person that was not done in
accordance with a written agreement does not and will not give rise to a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have a policy requiring employees and certain
consultants and contractors to execute a confidentiality and assignment
agreement substantially in the CompanyÂ’s standard form previously provided to
Parent.  The Company and its

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

Subsidiaries have enforced such policy, except where any failure to enforce
will not give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their current products or services has
infringed upon or otherwise violated, or is infringing upon or otherwise
violating, in any respect the Intellectual Property rights of any third
party, except where such infringement did not and will not give rise to a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no person
or any of its products or services is infringing upon or otherwise violating
in any material respect any Owned Company IP.

  



  

(i) There is no suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding made,
conducted or brought by a third party that has been served upon or, to the
knowledge of the Company, filed or threatened with respect to, and the
Company has not been notified in writing of, any infringement or other
violation in any material respect by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of its or their current products or services of the Intellectual
Property rights of such third party. To the knowledge of the Company, there
is no pending or threatened claim challenging the validity or
enforceability of, or contesting the CompanyÂ’s or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’
rights with respect to, any of the Company IP, nor to the knowledge of the
Company has any such claim been asserted since January 1, 2004.  The Company
and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order of any Governmental Entity
that restricts or impairs the use of any of their Intellectual Property,
other than restrictions or impairments that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(j) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in (i) the Company or
its Subsidiaries granting to any third party any rights or licenses to
any Intellectual Property, (ii) any right of termination or cancellation
under any Company IP Agreement, (iii) the imposition of any Lien on any
Owned Company IP, except where any of the foregoing (in clauses (i)
through (iii)) would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (iv) after
the Merger, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries being required, under the terms
of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
to grant any third party any rights or licenses to any of ParentÂ’s or any of
its SubsidiariesÂ’ Intellectual Property, except where the foregoing (in
clause (iv)) would not have a material adverse effect on ParentÂ’s Software
Global Business Unit.

  



  

(k) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no design or other errors in
the Company Products that permit unauthorized access to computers or systems
of users through those Company Products and that will give rise to a
Company Material Adverse Effect whether or not Company uses all commercially
reasonable efforts to correct such errors. Company and its Subsidiaries have
taken reasonable steps and implemented reasonable procedures to try to
prevent viruses and other disabling codes from entering Company Products as
described in Section 3.21(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. For the
avoidance of doubt, any unauthorized access caused in whole or in part, by
the operating systems, hardware or software of third parties, shall not be
deemed to be caused by the Company Products.

  



  

(l) To the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, Section 3.21(l) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists all software that is distributed as "open source software" or
under a similar

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

licensing or distribution model (including but not limited to the GNU General
Public License) that is incorporated into a Company Product.

  



  

(m) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has experienced any defects in the software and hardware used in their
business as it is currently conducted that have not been fully resolved,
including any error or omission in the processing of any data, and that will
give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have in place the disaster recovery plans and procedures
described on Section 3.21(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(n) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the material Company Source Code
for the Company Products has been published or disclosed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except to its employees or advisers or pursuant to
non-disclosure agreements, or, to the knowledge of the Company, by any other
person except as authorized by the Company under a non-disclosure agreement.
To the knowledge of the Company, no condition has occurred that would be
sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any source code escrow
arrangement under which the Company has deposited any material Company Source
Code for any Company Product to require release of such Company Source Code,
other than conditions that relate to the solvency or financial condition of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that relate to the involvement of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in any bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit
of creditors, or other activity or proceeding under state or federal law
relating to insolvency or the protection of creditors. The consummation of the
Merger will not constitute a condition sufficient to entitle the beneficiary
under any source code escrow arrangement under which the Company has
deposited any material Company Source Code for any Company Product to require
release of such Company Source Code. " **Company Source Code** " means
source code in which the copyrights and other Intellectual Property are part
of the Owned Company IP.

  



  

(o) The CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ collection and dissemination of
personal customer information in connection with their business has been
conducted in accordance with applicable privacy policies published or
otherwise adopted by the Company and its Subsidiary and any applicable Law,
except where the failure to abide by any such policy or Law will not,
individually or in the aggregate, give rise to a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

Section 3.22 _Insurance_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all material
policies of insurance covering the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
employees, properties or assets, including, without limitation, policies of
life, property, fire, workersÂ’ compensation, products liability, and
other casualty and liability insurance, that the Company believes is adequate
for the operation of its business. All such insurance policies are in full
force and effect, no notice of cancellation has been received, and there is
no existing default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default, by any insured thereunder, except
for such defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.23 _Related Party Transactions_. Except as set forth in the SEC
Reports or compensation or other employment arrangements in the ordinary
course, there are no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings
between the Company or any of its

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate (including any officer or
director) thereof, but not including any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, on the other hand.

  



  

Section 3.24 _Vote Required_. Assuming that the representations of Parent
and Merger Sub contained in _Section 4.6_ are correct, the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares, voting together as a
class (the " **Stockholder Approval** "), is the only vote of the holders of
any class or series of the CompanyÂ’s capital stock necessary (under
applicable Law or otherwise) to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger.
 Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub contained in
_Section 4.6_ are correct, the board of directors of the Company has taken
all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations set
forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable Law are not
applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger.

  



  

Section 3.25 _Brokers_. Except for Credit Suisse First Boston LLC
and Goldman, Sachs and Co. (true and correct copies of whose
engagement letters have been furnished to Parent), there is no investment
banker, broker, finder, agent or other Person that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is
entitled to any financial advisorÂ’s, brokerage, finderÂ’s or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 3.26 _Opinion of Financial Advisors_. The Company has received the
opinion of Goldman, Sachs and Co., to the effect that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Per Common Share Amount is fair to the holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Parent and Merger Sub) from a financial point of
view, and, as of the date of this Agreement, such opinion has not been
withdrawn, revoked or modified.

  



  

Section 3.27 _Consent Agreement Compliance_. The Company has not received
any written notice, and does not otherwise have knowledge, that any
Governmental Entity intends to seek any sanctions or penalty with respect to
the CompanyÂ’s compliance with the Supplemental Consent and Undertaking of the
Company (Case No. 03cv1276) entered in July 2003 by the United States
District Court for the Southern District of California.

Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each

nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has delivered or made available to the Company complete and
correct copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or other
constituent documents, as amended to date, of Parent and Merger Sub.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Authorization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite

compensation and employee benefits that are the same as the standard
compensation and employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing
contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to continue the employment of any specific person. Each employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that becomes eligible to participate in
the United States employee compensation and

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

benefit plans and employment policies of Parent (the " **Parent Plans** ")
shall receive credit for prior service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under the Parent Plans only for the purposes of determining
vacation accrual rate pursuant to ParentÂ’s standard procedures, for purposes
of eligibility to participate in, and vesting of benefits accrued under,
ParentÂ’s 401(k) Plan, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, for
purposes of eligibility to participate in, and vesting of benefits accrued
under, any employee compensation and benefit plans and employment policies of
Parent. Each such employeeÂ’s service for all other purposes shall be
calculated based on the date of hire by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the employment of any such
United States employee with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries is terminated
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause such
terminated employee to receive severance compensation and benefits that are
no less favorable than those the terminated employee would have been entitled
to under the CompanyÂ’s severance benefits policy under the terms of such
policy as in existence on the date hereof. Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
have the option to fulfill this obligation by providing a cash supplement to
ParentÂ’s or the SubsidiaryÂ’s standard severance programs. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor, to the extent administratively
practicable, all unused paid time off days accrued by the United States
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the policies and
practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof and to pay each such employee in cash for any accrued
and unused paid time off days that Parent determines are not administratively
practicable to continue to honor. In addition, with respect to United
States employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries that become eligible
to participate in the Parent Plans, Parent shall (i) waive all limitations
as to preexisting and at-work conditions, exclusions and waiting periods, if
any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each such employee, except to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods would apply under the Employee Plans absent any change in
plan coverage and (ii) provide credit to each such employee for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to any change in coverage in satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent
Plans for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time and subject to ParentÂ’s review (but not its
consent), the Company shall be entitled to amend (effective as of the
Effective Time) the option agreements for each employee whose Current Options
will be converted into Adjusted Stock Options in accordance with _Section
2.11(a)(i) _to provide that, if such employeeÂ’s employment is terminated by
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any other Subsidiary thereof without
Cause (as defined in the CompanyÂ’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan) prior to the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, each such Adjusted Stock Option held
by such terminated employee immediately prior to such termination will fully
vest and such employee will have the right to exercise each such Adjusted
Stock Option after his or her termination date in accordance with the
applicable provision for termination of employment under the CompanyÂ’s 2003
Equity Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x)
any vesting acceleration provided pursuant to this _Section 5.7(b) _shall be
in addition to (and not in lieu of) any severance or termination pay
or benefits that would otherwise be provided to such terminated employee
in respect of such termination of employment, (y) a employeeÂ’s employment
shall not be considered to have been terminated by the Surviving Corporation
if such employee becomes employed by Parent or another subsidiary of Parent
and (z) no such amendment shall be made in

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

respect of any employee with an employment agreement with the Company if the
effect of such amendment would adversely affect such employee.

  



  

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.7_ shall create any beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any dependent thereof)
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in
respect of continued employment for any specified period of any nature or
kind whatsoever.

  



  

(d) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, but conditioned upon the subsequent occurrence of the Closing, the
Company shall terminate or cause to be terminated any Employee Plan intended
to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " **Terminating Plan**
"), unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that any such
Terminating Plan shall not be terminated. Unless Parent provides such
written notice to the Company, no later than three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
Terminating Plan(s) have been terminated (effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, but contingent upon the subsequent
occurrence of the Closing) pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors
of the Company or one of its ERISA Affiliates, as the case may be. The form
and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such Terminating Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably
require.

  



  

(e) With respect to matters described in this _Section 5.7_, the Company
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Parent (and
consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or
other communication materials to any employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and the Company will not send any written notices or other
written communication materials to any such employees without using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the prior written consent of
Parent.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Merger Sub and Parent shall
consult with each other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any press release or
make any public statement prior to obtaining the other partiesÂ’ written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except
that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may
be required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange or Nasdaq rule or
any listing agreement of any party hereto.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with all obligations of the Company
that were in existence or in effect as of the date hereof under Law, its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or any contract listed on Section 5.9 of
the Company Disclosure Schedules, relating to the indemnification of any
Person who is now or was at any time after August 18, 2003 or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or the beneficiary of any such contractual obligations (the
" **Indemnified Persons** ").  Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees the
payment and performance of the

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligations in this _Section 5.9_. This _Section
5.9_ shall not limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Person may
have under any agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
the CompanyÂ’s or any such SubsidiaryÂ’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or other organization documents or otherwise under applicable Law.

  



  

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain policies of directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance covering each Person who is now or was at any
time after August 18, 2003 a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or prior to the Effective Time and providing at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms that in aggregate are not less
advantageous to the insured parties than those contained in the policies of
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof
(the " **Current Policy Coverage** "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend, per annum, in
excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage (or such coverage as is available for 300% of such annual premium);
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premium required to provide the
foregoing insurance exceeds 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company, the Surviving Corporation shall provide as much of such insurance as
can be purchased for such premium, and, any present or former officer or
director, upon reasonable written notice thereof from the Surviving
Corporation, who desires to be covered by the Current Policy Coverage may so
elect and shall be covered by the Current Policy Coverage so long as such
former officer or director pays the portion of the premium for such policies
in excess of the amount which the Surviving Corporation is obligated to pay
pursuant to this _Section 5.9_.

  



  

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Tax Election_. At the request of Parent and with the consent
of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), the Company
shall deliver at the Closing such validly executed elections as Parent shall
request it to make under Treasury regulation Section 301.7701-3(c)
with respect to such Subsidiaries as Parent shall designate and effective as
of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such election shall form the basis, directly or indirectly, of
any claim by Parent against the Company, including any claim relating to the
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Obligations of Merger Sub; Voting of Company Common Stock_.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent shall vote any Shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries
in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

Section 5.12 _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) contesting any Legal Proceeding
or Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) executing any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Effective
Time to occur as soon as practicable. If at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party hereto shall take
all such necessary action.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Internal Control Over Financial Reporting_.  The Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts to determine the reasons for, and to
correct material weaknesses in the CompanyÂ’s internal controls over financial
reporting identified in its internal testing described in Section 5.13 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company will advise Parent of the status of
such internal testing upon ParentÂ’s reasonable request therefor but no
more frequently than once every month. The Company shall not be deemed to be
in breach of this _Section 5.13_ to the extent that such breach results from
the failure of Parent to approve a capital expenditure requested by the
Company pursuant to _Section 5.1(q)_.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur would cause (a) (i) any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality to be
untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure by such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement.

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that Parent would
not have entered into this Agreement without _Section 7.2(b)_; accordingly,

amounts due pursuant to _Section 7.2(b) _and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable

Section 8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the
parties hereto will bear all legal, accounting, investment banking and other
fees, expenses and costs incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not
such transactions are consummated.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Disclosure Generally_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, a matter set forth in one item of the Company Disclosure
Schedule need not be set forth in any other item of the Company Disclosure
Schedule so long as its relevance to the other sections or subsections of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or section of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar
thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the
terms "material," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Personal Liability_. This Agreement shall not create or be
deemed to create or permit any personal Liability or obligation on the part
of any direct or indirect stockholder of the Company or Buyer or any officer,
director, employee, agent, representative or investor of any party hereto.

Section 8.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by
Parent and by action taken by or on behalf of the respective boards
of directors of Merger Sub and the Company at any time before the Effective
Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting, no amendment
shall be made which would reduce the amount or change the kind of
consideration to be received in exchange for the Shares upon consummation of
the Merger or effect any other change not permitted by Section 251(d) of the
DGCL. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed
by the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 8.7 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso of _Section 8.6_, waive
compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only against such party and
only if set forth in an instrument, in writing, signed by such party. The
failure or delay by any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial
assertion of a right preclude any other or further assertion thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The rights and remedies herein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

  



  

Section 8.8 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors
and permitted assigns and, except as provided in _Article II_ and _Section
5.9_, nothing in this Agreement express or implied is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment in violation of this
_Section 8.8_ shall be null and void and of no effect, provided, that Parent
or Merger Sub may assign any of their respective rights and obligations to
any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its obligations
hereunder.

  



  

Section 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard
to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

  



  

Section 8.10 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any
Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be exclusively brought in (a) the courts of the
Court of Chancery of Delaware or (b) the Federal courts of the United States
of America located in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties consents
to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Legal Proceeding in any such court or
that any Legal Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be served on
any party anywhere in the world, whether within

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service or process on such party as
provided in _Section 8.2_ shall be deemed effective service of process on
such party. **Each party waives any right to trial by jury with respect to
any Legal Proceeding based on any matter arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.**

  



  

Section 8.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of
this Agreement and that each party shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunction or specific performance, as a remedy for any
such breach.

  



  

Section 8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.

  



  

Section 8.13 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall
become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart
hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

  



  

Section 8.15 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings both written and oral between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be duly
executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.
