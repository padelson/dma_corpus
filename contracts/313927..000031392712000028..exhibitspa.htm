make indemnity payments under Section 10.4 or Article 11, and for the Sellers'
obligation to make indemnity payments under Article 11. Funds on deposit in
the Escrow Account shall be released as follows:

(B) is not reasonably determinable to be less than an amount equal to
$48,750,000 less the sum of the amounts set forth in clauses (A) and (C), then
the release of funds from the Escrow Account pursuant to this Section
4.3(d)(ii) shall be delayed until the date on which the amount set forth in
clause (B) is determined to be less than an amount equal to $48,750,000 less

(iii) On the date that is eighteen (18) months from and after the Closing
Date, or such later date on which an amount is released from the Escrow
Account pursuant to this Section 4.3(d)(iii) (the "Final Escrow Release
Date"), the Escrow Agent shall release all funds remaining on deposit in the
Escrow Account (including any interest earned thereon) to the Seller
Representative; provided, however, that if prior to the Final Escrow Release

claim is resolved prior to the Final Escrow Release Date, by non-appealable
judicial determination or otherwise, any sums due to Purchaser shall be paid
from the Escrow Account (including any interest earned thereon); and (B) if
any such claim is not resolved prior to the Escrow Release Date, the amount of
such claim shall be retained in the Escrow Account until such claim is

(iv) The Escrow Amount shall not be subject to any Lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party hereto, and
shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes stated in, and in
accordance with the terms of, the Escrow Agreement. Obligations of the Sellers
to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document shall not be limited at any time to the Escrow Amount or the funds on
deposit in the Escrow Account. The Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that Purchaser\'s exercise of its rights under the Escrow Agreement shall not
limit Purchaser\'s right to recover any amounts owed to it that exceed the
Escrow Amount and application of funds on deposit in the Escrow Account shall
not be in substitution of or in any way limit Purchaser\'s exercise of its
other rights and remedies hereunder or otherwise. Each of the Seller
Representative and Purchaser agree that it will instruct the Escrow Agent
promptly with respect to the release of any amounts to which either of them is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement. If there should be a dispute as to the
amount or manner of determination of any indemnity obligation owed under this
Agreement, the Seller Representative and the Purchaser shall issue joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay when due such portion, if any,
of the obligation as shall not be subject to dispute. In the event the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser do not submit joint written instructions when
required by the terms of this Section 4.3(d), the parties shall submit to a
court of competent jurisdiction, as provided in this Agreement, upon the
request of either the Seller Representative or the Purchaser to settle any
dispute or unresolved issue.

Purchaser and the Seller Representative will jointly proceed with a physical
stocktaking of the inventory (including raw materials, componentry, work in
process and finished Products) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
consistent with GAAP and the Company's historical procedures for the taking of
a full year-end physical inventory count, including the Company's inventory
reserve policies. At the end of the physical count, on the same day if
practicable and at the latest on the following Business Day, Purchaser and
Seller Representative shall prepare and sign a certificate, stating in
reasonable detail the quantities of each product or each product family and
reflecting all shipments of finished Products made by, or shipments of raw
materials inventories received by, the Company or any Company Subsidiary on
and after the Closing Date. In the absence of manifest error, such certificate
shall be binding upon the parties and shall be used for purposes of the
Initial Purchase Price Calculation Statement.

  

  

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller Representative a written statement (the "Initial
Purchase Price Calculation Statement") setting forth Purchaser\'s calculations
(the "Purchaser\'s Proposed Calculations") of: (i) the amount of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 15 -  

  

 

 

  

  

the Closing Cash; (ii) the amount of the Closing Indebtedness; (iii) the
amount of all Employer Taxes; and (iv) the amount of the Closing Net Working
Capital and the Net Working Capital Adjustment (the adjustment will not
reflect any adjustment for trade and coupon accruals, which will be finalized
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date in accordance with the guidelines
identified below in this clause (b)) calculated by reference thereto, which
calculations shall be made as of 12:01 a.m., Pacific Time, on the Closing Date
in accordance with GAAP. The Initial Purchase Price Calculation Statement
shall contain a recalculation of the estimated Purchase Price used at Closing
based on the foregoing amounts.

 

  

  

(i) Purchaser shall be entitled to a payment from the Escrow Account in an
amount equal to the positive amount, if any, of (1) the expense incurred by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to coupons issued prior
to Closing that are redeemed in the Ordinary Course of Business during the
initial ninety (90) days following Closing minus (2) the amount of reserves on
the accounting records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately
prior to Closing with respect to such expense.

  

  

(ii) Purchaser shall be entitled to a payment from the Escrow Account in an
amount equal to the positive amount, if any, of (1) the aggregate expense
incurred by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for trade promotions
reimbursements that are requested during the initial ninety (90) days
following Closing by Costco, Target and BJs in the Ordinary Course of Business
with respect to trade promotions conducted by such customers prior to Closing
minus (2) the aggregate amount of reserves on the accounting records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to Closing with respect
to trade promotions expense for such three customers.

  

  

(iii) Within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Initial Purchase Price
Calculation Statement, the Seller Representative shall notify the Purchaser in
writing of its agreement or disagreement with the Initial Purchase Price
Calculation Statement and the accuracy of any of the Purchaser\'s Proposed
Calculations (and during such 30-day period, the Purchaser shall grant the
Seller Representative and its accountants reasonable access to all work
papers, schedules and calculations used in the preparation of the Initial
Purchase Price Calculation Statement). If the Seller Representative does not
dispute any aspect of the Initial Purchase Price Calculation Statement or the
amount of any of the Purchaser\'s Proposed Calculations within such 30-day
period, then the Initial Purchase Price Calculation Statement and the
Purchaser\'s Proposed Calculations shall be conclusive and binding upon
Purchaser and the Sellers (the "Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement").

  

  

(iv) If the Seller Representative disputes any aspect of the Initial Purchase
Price Calculation Statement or the amount of any of the Purchaser\'s Proposed
Calculations within such 30-day period, then the Seller Representative shall
have the right to direct its independent accountants, at the Seller
Representative\'s expense, to review and verify the accuracy of the Initial
Purchase Price Calculation Statement. In such event, the Seller Representative
and its accountants shall complete their review and verification of the
Initial Purchase Price Calculation Statement within sixty (60) days after the
Seller Representative\'s receipt thereof and, if the Seller Representative and
its accountants, after such review and verification, still disagree with the
Purchaser\'s Proposed Calculations, the Seller Representative shall submit its
proposed alternative calculations ("Sellers\' Proposed Calculations") of the
amount of the Closing Cash, the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, the amount
of the Employer Taxes, the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital and the
Net Working Capital Adjustment calculated by reference thereto, and containing
a recalculation of the estimated Purchase Price used at Closing based on the
foregoing amounts, to Purchaser in writing within sixty-five (65) days after
the Seller Representative\'s receipt of the Initial Purchase Price Calculation
Statement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 16 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) If Purchaser agrees to such changes, or fails to object within thirty (30)
days after its receipt of Sellers\' Proposed Calculations, Sellers\' Proposed
Calculations shall be used to determine the Final Purchase Price Calculation
Statement. If, however, Purchaser objects to Sellers\' Proposed Calculations
within thirty (30) days after its receipt thereof, then, within a 30-day
period after the date of Purchaser\'s objection to Sellers\' Proposed
Calculations, the Seller Representative and Purchaser shall seek in good faith
to resolve any differences which they may have with respect to any matter
specified in the Sellers\' Proposed Calculations. If the Seller Representative
and Purchaser do not resolve all such objections to Sellers\' Proposed
Calculations on a mutually agreeable basis within such 30-day period, any such
objection to Sellers\' Proposed Calculations as to which Purchaser and the
Seller Representative cannot agree upon may be submitted by Purchaser or
Seller Representative to KPMG, LLP, which the parties acknowledge is a
mutually acceptable firm (such firm, the "Independent Accounting Firm") to
resolve the remaining disputed items (the "Remaining Disputed Items") by
conducting the Independent Accounting Firm\'s own review and verification of
the Initial Purchase Price Calculation Statement, and thereafter selecting
either Sellers\' Proposed Calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or the
Purchaser\'s Proposed Calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or an
amount in between the two. The Sellers and Purchaser shall be bound by the
determination of the Remaining Disputed Items by the Independent Accounting
Firm and such determination shall be used to determine the Final Purchase
Price Calculation Statement.

  

  

(vi) Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree to execute, if requested by
the Independent Accounting Firm, an engagement letter containing reasonable
and customary terms. Purchaser shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred
under this Section 4.4(b) and the Seller Representative shall pay its own
costs and expenses incurred under this Section 4.4(b) on behalf of the
Sellers. The costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
borne one-half by Purchaser and one-half by the Sellers, and paid by the
Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based upon the provisions of
this Section 4.4(b), only the Remaining Disputed Items and the determination
of each amount of the Remaining Disputed Items shall be made in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.4(b) and, in any event, shall
be no less than the lesser of the amount claimed by either Purchaser or the
Seller Representative, and shall be no greater than the greater of the amount
claimed by either Purchaser or the Seller Representative.

  

  

(c) Upon the determination, in accordance with Section 4.4(b), of the Final
Purchase Price Calculation Statement and the final calculations of the amounts
of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Employer Taxes, the Closing
Net Working Capital and the Net Working Capital Adjustment calculated by
reference thereto, the Purchase Price shall be recalculated using such finally
determined amounts in lieu of the estimates of such amounts used in the
calculation of the estimated Purchase Price payable at Closing:

  

  

(i) If the Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to this Section 4.4(c) is
greater than the estimated Purchase Price set forth on the Estimated Purchase
Price Calculation Statement (the "Excess Amount"), then Purchaser shall cause
to be paid to the Seller Representative (for distribution to Sellers) and to
the Company (on behalf of each Optionholder), in cash, their respective Fully
Diluted Pro Rata Share of the Excess Amount (subject to Tax Withholdings with
respect to payments of the Excess Amount to Optionholders).

  

  

(ii) If the Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to this Section 4.4(c) is
less than the estimated Purchase Price set forth on the Estimated Purchase
Price Calculation Statement (the "Deficiency"), then the Seller Representative
and the Purchaser shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release funds to be
paid to or as directed by Purchaser out of the Escrow

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 17 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     | Account up to the Adjustment Escrow Amount no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement shall have
become final and binding on the parties. To the extent the Adjustment Escrow
Amount is insufficient to cover the full amount of the Deficiency, the Keen
Managed Reserve Trust shall be liable for such insufficiency and pay such
amount to or as directed by Purchaser simultaneously with the payment from the
Escrow Account.  
---|--- 
 

  

  

  

(iii) Any payments made by Purchaser to the Seller Representative, the Sellers
or the Optionholders, or by the Sellers and the Optionholders to Purchaser,
pursuant to this Section 4.4(c) shall be deemed to be adjustments to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

  

  

(d) Prior to the determination of the Final Purchase Price Calculation
Statement, Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly make any changes to the
books and records of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries relating to
periods prior to the Closing. Subject to this Section 4.4, no change to the
accounting methods, policies, practices or procedures made with respect to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries made after Closing shall give rise
to any Liability of any Seller under this Agreement, whether pursuant to
Article 11 or otherwise.

  

  

4.5 Withholding. To the extent not otherwise withheld by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, Purchaser shall be entitled to retain and withhold from
the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Seller or Optionholder
such amounts as Purchaser is required to retain and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of foreign, state
or local Law and instead shall pay such amount to the applicable Governmental
Authority. To the extent that amounts are properly so withheld by Purchaser
and paid to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts withheld shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
Seller or Optionholder in respect of which such retention and withholding was
made by Purchaser.

(a) Schedule 6.25(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all "employee benefit
plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to
ERISA), and any and all other retirement, employment, collective bargaining,
welfare, life, insurance, post-retirement, disability, vacation, unemployment,
bonus, pension, change in control, profit sharing, equity, stock option, stock
bonus or deferred compensation, severance, sick leave or other material plan
or arrangement providing benefits to current or former employees, officers,
directors or other service providers of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case whether terminated or not terminated, written or
unwritten, insured or not insured or foreign or domestic, of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Benefit Plans") currently
maintained, sponsored or contributed to or required to be maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their
respective ERISA Affiliates or under which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or their respective ERISA Affiliates otherwise have or could
reasonably be expected to have, or had, any obligations or liabilities.

  

  

(b) All Benefit Plans comply and have been maintained and operated in all
material respects in accordance with all Laws (including, without limitation,
ERISA and the Code) applicable to such plans and the terms and conditions of
the respective plan documents. The Benefit Plans that are intended to qualify
under Section 401 of the Code are so qualified and the trusts maintained
pursuant thereto are exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of
the Code, and the IRS has issued a favorable determination letter or prototype
or volume submitter plan opinion letter with respect to each such Benefit
Plan, and to the Knowledge of the Company nothing has occurred with respect to
such plans which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material liability,
penalty or Tax under ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law. No Benefit Plan
is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No
Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan").
Except for continuation coverage as required by Section 4980(B) of the Code or
by applicable state insurance Laws, no Benefit Plan provides life, health,
medical or other welfare benefits to any current or former employees,
officers, directors or other service providers (including their respective
beneficiaries and dependents) of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
following any such Person\'s retirement or termination of employment or
service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has contributed to a nonconforming group health
plan (as defined in Section 5000(c)) of the Code and none of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred a
Tax under Section 5000(a) of the Code. No Benefit Plan is under or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, expected to be under, nor has the Company or any
Company Subsidiary been notified of any impending, audit or investigation by
the IRS, United States Department of Labor, or any other Governmental
Authority and no such completed audit, if any, has resulted in the imposition
of any unpaid Tax liability. With respect to each Benefit Plan that is funded
mostly or partially through an insurance policy, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any material liability in the nature of retroactive
rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent
liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring on or before the
Closing Date. No trust providing funding to any Benefit Plan is intended to
meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and no amounts payable
under any Benefit Plan will fail to be deductible for federal income tax
purposes by virtue of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 32 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company has delivered or made available to Purchaser true, correct and
complete copies of each Benefit Plan (or if such plan is unwritten, then a

applicable, correct and complete copies of the current plan documents,
amendments, summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications,
the most recent determination letter received from the IRS, the two most
recent Form 5500 Annual Reports and all financial statements and accompanying
schedules, and all related trust agreements, insurance contracts and other
funding arrangements that implement each Benefit Plan. The Company has also
delivered or made available to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of
each employee handbook and all material written communications applicable to
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

  

  

(d) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions, if any) that are due and payable have been
made within the time period prescribed by ERISA to each Benefit Plan that is
an Employee Pension Benefit Plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA). With respect to each other Benefit Plan, all contributions required to
be made under the terms of any such Benefit Plan as of the date hereof have
been timely made or, if not yet due, have been fully reserved for and
specifically identified in the Most Recent Balance Sheet. None of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has
incurred, or is reasonably likely to incur, any unfunded liabilities in
relation to any Benefit Plan that have not been properly accounted for under
GAAP.

  

  

(e) None of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of
the Company any trustee or administrator of any Benefit Plan, has engaged in
any transaction with respect to such Benefit Plan that would subject the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant
Section 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed
by Section 4975 of the Code. No fiduciary of any Benefit Plan has any
liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply
in connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any
Benefit Plan. No actions, suits or claims with respect to the assets of any
Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) are pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened or reasonably anticipated.

  

  

(f) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Liability, directly or indirectly, to the
PBGC or otherwise, under any Multiemployer Plan, Multiple Employer Plan or any
other plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, or Title IV or Sections 302,
4063, or 4064 of ERISA (including any withdrawal liability as defined in
Section 4201 of ERISA).

  

  

(g) None of the Company or a Company Subsidiary maintains or is obligated to
contribute to any Benefit Plan maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
United States, subject to the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United
States, or covering any employee residing or working outside the United
States.

  

  

(h) Except as set forth on Schedule 6.25(h), neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will give rise to or result in (i) any payment becoming
due to any current or former employee, officer, director, or other service
provider (or their respective beneficiaries or dependents) solely by reason of
such transactions or by reason of a termination of employment following such
transactions) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) increase any
benefits otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any
such plan.

  

  

(i) No Benefit Plan is or ever was a "non-qualified deferred compensation
plan" as defined under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations
thereunder. No Person is entitled to any

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 33 -  

  

 

 

  

  

gross-up, make-whole or other additional payment from the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in respect of any Tax (including federal, state, local and
foreign income, excise and other Taxes (including Taxes imposed under Code
Section 409A or 4999)) or interest or penalty related thereto.

 

  

  

(j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers has made any promises or commitments, to create any employee benefit
plan or agreement, or modify or change any Benefit Plan. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no event, condition, or circumstance exists that could reasonably
be expected to result in an increase of the benefits provided under any
Benefit Plan or the expense of maintaining any Benefit Plan from the level of
benefits or expense incurred for the most recent fiscal year ended before the
Closing Date. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event, condition, or
circumstance exists that would prevent the amendment or termination of any
Benefit Plan other than in accordance with its terms.

  

  

This Section 6.25 contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan matters
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including any

to, deliver any and all other instruments or documents required to be
delivered pursuant to, or necessary or proper in order to give effect to, all
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

10.2 Publicity. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, or in
connection with any financing, other than in connection with any filings,
reports or disclosures of Purchaser under the Securities Exchange Act or
pursuant to New York Stock Exchange rules, and except for Purchaser\'s
employee or other internal communications, no publicity release or

operations prior to Closing shall be acquired by Purchaser in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that
the Sellers may from time to time after the Closing require access to or
copies of such records. Purchaser agrees that upon reasonable prior notice
from the Seller Representative, it shall, during normal business hours,
provide or cause to be provided to the Seller Representative access to or
copies of such records (at Seller Representative\'s cost) in connection with
audits, investigations, litigations or for other reasonable business purposes
relating to the business or operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees that it shall not
(and shall cause each of its Affiliates, including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries not to), for a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing
Date, destroy any material business records of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary prepared on or before the Closing without first notifying the
Seller

to remove or copy such records at Seller Representative\'s cost.

any Company Subsidiary, shall have any right to review, access or obtain
copies of the Attorney Records. The Company waives, for itself and each
Company Subsidiary, any and all rights any of them may have with respect to
the Attorney Records. All Attorney Records in the possession of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date shall be immediately delivered to
the Seller Representative.

  

  

10.4 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Pre-Closing Taxes.

  

  

(i) Keen Managed Reserve Trust shall be liable for and indemnify Purchaser for
any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from (i) any and all
liabilities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for Taxes in respect of
Pre-Closing Tax Periods except to the extent such liabilities are included in
the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section
4.4(b), (ii) any and all liabilities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for Taxes in respect of the portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the
Closing Date, (iii) any and all liabilities of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
corresponding or similar provision under state, local or foreign Law) for
Taxes of any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any predecessor) has been a
member prior to the Closing, and any and all liabilities for Taxes of any
Person (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary) otherwise imposed on
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (iv)
any and all liabilities for Taxes imposed on the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax Period as a result of any agreement for
the allocation, sharing or indemnification of Taxes entered into by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any predecessor) prior to the Closing.

  

  

(ii) Keen Managed Reserve Trust shall pay Purchaser any amount required to be
paid by Sellers pursuant to Section 10.4(a)(i) (including any Taxes that are
contested in an Audit and that must be paid prior to or upon the commencement
of such Audit) within the latter of (x) five days after it receives written
notice from Purchaser requesting such payment and (y) two days prior to the
date that the indemnified Tax or related expense is required to be paid. The
amount of indemnification for Taxes pursuant to Section 10.4(a)(i) shall be
net of any Tax Benefit.

  

  

(iii) The Seller Representative shall control the preparation of any Tax
Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any taxable period ending
on or before the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall file such Tax Returns. The
Keen Management Reserve Trust shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown
due thereon except to the extent the liability for such Taxes are included in
the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section
4.4(b). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
prior practice of the Company except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
Before the filing of any Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax
Returns shall be submitted to Purchaser for review and approval by Purchaser,
which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Seller Representative and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
disagreements regarding

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 51 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     | such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing, including any
applicable extensions. If the Seller Representative and Purchaser are unable
to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return before the due date for
filing, including any applicable extensions, such dispute shall be submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution (if practicable, ten (10)
days before such due date for filing, but in any event such submission to the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be made sufficiently in advance of such due
date for filing to permit a full review by the Independent Accounting Firm),
which resolution shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. If for any
reason, the dispute cannot be resolved at least two days before the Tax Return
is due, the Tax Return will be filed in the manner that the Seller
Representative reasonably deems to be correct. After the Independent
Accounting Firm\'s determination, if needed, the Company and each applicable
Company Subsidiary shall cause an amended Tax Return to be filed in accordance
with such determination.  
---|--- 
 

  

  

(b) Post-Closing Taxes.

  

  

(i) For purposes of determining the attribution of Taxes to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, Post-Closing Tax Periods, or to the portion of a Straddle Period up
to and including the close of business on the Closing Date allocations of
items of income, gain, loss, credit or deductions required to determine such
Taxes shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary as of the close of business on the Closing
Date; provided, that for Straddle Periods, exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period beginning the day after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period. Property, ad valorem and
similar Taxes shall be apportioned between the period ending on the Closing
Date and the period beginning the day after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each such period.

  

  

(ii) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company for the Straddle Period and for all
taxable periods beginning on and after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing Tax
Periods"). All Tax Returns for any Straddle Period shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with prior practice of the Company except as otherwise
required by applicable Law. If any Tax Return for the Straddle Period affects
the interests of Sellers and Optionholders, such Tax Returns shall be
submitted to Seller Representative before filing by Purchaser for review and
approval, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Purchaser and Seller Representative shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns before the due date for
filing. If Purchaser and Seller Representative are unable to resolve any
dispute with respect to such Tax Return before the due date for filing, such
dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution
(if practicable, 10 days before such due date for filing, but in any event
such submission to the Independent Accounting Firm shall be made sufficiently
in advance of such due date for filing to permit a full review by the
Independent Accounting Firm), which resolution shall be conclusive and binding
on all parties. If for any reason, the dispute cannot be resolved at least two
days before the Tax Return is due, the Tax Return will be filed in the manner
that the Purchaser deems to be correct. After the Independent Accounting
Firm\'s determination, if needed, the Purchaser shall cause an amended Tax
Return to be filed in accordance with such determination.

  

  

(c) Tax Refunds. Except to the extent included in the Closing Net Working
Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 4.4(b), any Tax refunds and
any amounts credited against Tax that are received by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or the Purchaser, or to which any of them

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 52 -  

  

 

 

  

  

become entitled, that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of
any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (excluding any refund or credit
attributable to any loss carry back from a period beginning after the Closing
Date) shall be for the account of the Sellers and Optionholders, and the
Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller Representative any such refund or the
amount of any such credit (net of any Taxes payable by the Company or the
Purchaser attributable to such refund or credit) within 15 days after receipt
or entitlement thereto. For purposes of this Section 10.4(c), the amount
reimbursed to any party for credits shall equal only the actual cash benefit
generated by such credits. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement
requires Purchaser to file any Tax Return or to amend any Tax Return to create
or increase any Tax refund or amounts to credit against Taxes.

 

  

  

(d) Amendments. Purchaser shall not amend, and shall not permit the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries to amend, any Income Tax Return or election
made in connection with such Income Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such amendment would have
the effect of materially reducing the amount of any refunds to which the
Sellers would otherwise be entitled pursuant to Section 10.4(c), unless such
amendment is otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Tax Cooperation. Purchaser and the Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with
each other in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns related to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and shall preserve all information,
returns, books, records and documents relating to any liabilities for Taxes
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or other tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date until the later of the expiration of all applicable statutes
of limitation and extensions thereof, or a final determination with respect to
Taxes for such period and shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any record
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or other tax period, ending on or
before the Closing Date without first providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and copy the same. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, but not later than thirty (30) days thereafter, Sellers and the
Seller Representative will cause to be delivered to Purchaser all of the
original books and records (including work papers) and Tax Returns of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary which are in the possession of Sellers or
the Seller Representative, any Affiliates of any of the Sellers or the Seller
Representative, any accountants or other advisors of any of the Sellers or the
Seller Representative.

  

  

(f) Post-Closing Audits.

  

  

(i) Purchaser shall notify the Seller Representative in writing within twenty
(20) days after receipt by Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary of
any official inquiry, examination, audit or proceeding ("Audit") regarding any
Tax Return or period with respect to which the Sellers may have a right to a
refund under Section 10.4(c), an additional obligation for Taxes, an indemnity
obligation under Section 10.4(a)(i), or an indemnity obligation under Section
11.2. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.4(f), the Seller
Representative shall have the right to exercise, on behalf of the Sellers and
at the expense of the Sellers, control at any time over the handling,
disposition and/or settlement of any issue raised in any Audit regarding any
taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date (other than an Audit
involving a Straddle Period), provided that the Seller Representative has
acknowledged in writing the Seller indemnification obligation under Section
10.4(a)(i) in respect of the Taxes at issue in such Audit if such Audit is
resolved adversely, by notifying Purchaser in writing within fifteen (15) days
from the receipt from Purchaser of the notice described in the first sentence
of this Section 10.4(f)(i) (or within such shorter period of time as may be
required by such notice) of its intention to assume control of the conduct of
such Audit. Purchaser shall be entitled (at Purchaser\'s expense) to
participate in such Audit (whether such Audit is conducted in person, by
telephone or otherwise) with its representatives, to receive copies of all
written communications, materials and submissions related to such Audit
received from, or provided to, any Governmental

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 53 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

  

    Authority involved with such Audit, and to have a reasonable
opportunity to comment on any such written materials to be provided to any
such Government Entity. The Seller Representative shall keep Purchaser
informed on a timely basis of all developments and shall not resolve such
Audit without Purchaser\'s prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  
--- 
 

  

  

 

  

(ii) Purchaser shall have the right, with counsel of its choice, to represent
the interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in any Audit involving
a Straddle Period. The Seller Representative may participate in any such Audit
at its own expense and the Seller Representative shall be kept informed of the
progress of such Audit. Purchaser shall keep the Seller Representative
informed on a timely basis of all developments and the Seller
Representative\'s written consent shall be required prior to the settlement of
any Audit relating to a Straddle Period if the settlement would materially
negatively affect the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(iii) Except as provided in Sections 10.4(f)(i) and 10.4(f)(ii), Purchaser
shall have the right, at its own expense, to exercise control at any time over
the handling, disposition and/or settlement of any issue raised in any Audit
regarding any Tax Return or regarding any Tax matter (including the right to
settle or otherwise terminate any contest with respect thereto).

  

  

(iv) If the Seller Representative declines in writing to assume the control or
joint control of an Audit or otherwise fails to take control or joint control
of or timely defend an Audit for a Pre-Closing Tax Period as described herein,
Purchaser shall have the right, to assume control of the conduct and
resolution of such Audit.

  

  

(g) No Tax Elections. Purchaser covenants that neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall make an election under Section 338 of the Code with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers shall
have no Liability, and Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Sellers, with respect to any Taxes resulting by reason of any election made or
deemed to be made by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates subsequent to the
Closing, whether express or implied, under Section 338 of the Code (or any
similar state or foreign statute).

  

  

(h) Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording,
transfer or similar fees or taxes or governmental charges (together with any
interest or penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed) as levied
by any taxing authority in connection with transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, along with all out-of-pocket costs associated with the preparation
and filing of the Tax Returns under this Section 10.4(h), shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) percent by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers.
Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be filed all necessary documentation
and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes and Sellers will cooperate
with Purchaser.

  

  

(i) Tax Sharing Agreements. Prior to the Closing, all agreements entered into
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with any Person (other than the
Company or any Company Subsidiary) for the sharing or allocating of Taxes
shall be terminated, and no additional payments shall be required to be made
thereunder by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  

  

(j) Survival. The terms, conditions, rights, obligations, covenants,
indemnification obligations and other provisions contained in this Section
10.4 shall survive indefinitely.

  

  

(k) Interaction with Article 11. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, to the extent that a provision of this Section 10.4 directly
conflicts with a provision of Article XI,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 54 -  

  

 

 

  

  

this Section 10.4 shall govern. For avoidance of doubt, none of the
limitations under Section 11.4(a) or (b) shall apply to any claim arising
under this Section 10.4.

 

  

  

10.5 Indemnification; Exculpation of Liability.

  

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall not permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to amend,
repeal or modify any provision in their respective Organizational Documents
relating to exculpation or indemnification of former officers and directors
holding office on or before the Closing Date, it being the intent of the
parties that the officers and directors of the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date shall continue to be entitled to
such exculpation and indemnification to the greatest extent permitted under
the Laws of the State of Washington; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall restrict or prevent Purchaser or the Company from changing its corporate
structure, including by way of merger.

  

  

(b) The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 10.5 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to
whom this Section 10.5 applies without the consent of the affected Person, it
being expressly agreed that each such Person to whom this Section 10.5 applies
shall be a third party beneficiary of this Section 10.5.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a prepaid tail policy to
the current policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all persons who are currently
covered by such current policy with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Closing Date for a claims reporting or
discovered period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date.

  

  

10.6 Obligations to Continuing Employees.

  

  

(a) Following Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to honor and satisfy all of their respective obligations and
liabilities with respect to any Benefit Plan set forth on Schedule 10.6 and
existing as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to continue any such
Benefit Plan after the Closing, and any such Benefit Plan may be amended or
terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. To the extent that
any Benefit Plan described in the first sentence of this Section 10.6(a) is
terminated or amended after the Closing and prior to the first anniversary of
the Closing so as to eliminate the future benefits that are being provided
with respect to participants thereunder, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange for each individual who is then a participant in
such terminated or amended Benefit Plan to participate in an alternative
benefit plan of Purchaser or one of its Affiliates ("Purchaser Benefit Plan")
subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchaser Benefit Plan, including
any eligibility requirements, Purchaser\'s or one of its Affiliates right to
amend or terminate the Purchaser Benefit Plan, and the required approval of
any applicable insurance provider; provided, however, that, upon participation
by such participant in any such Purchaser Benefit Plan: (i) such participant
shall receive full credit for years of service performed with the Company or
the applicable Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing to the same extent and
for the same purposes for which such service was recognized under the
applicable Benefit Plan except to the extent such service credit will result
in benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan, and provided that no such
service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits or be required
under a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken into
account for employees of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries); (ii) Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations
(but solely to the extent such limitations were satisfied or did not apply
with respect to a pre-existing condition under the applicable Benefit Plan)
under any group health plans to be waived with respect to such participant and
his or her eligible dependents; and (iii) except as would not

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 55 -  

  

 

 

  

  

result in the duplication of benefits to any participant, Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Purchaser Benefit Plan that is a
group welfare plan to provide such participant with credit towards any
applicable deductibles, co-payments and similar exclusions for expenses
incurred and paid by such participant under the applicable Benefit Plan prior
to the Closing with respect to the plan year in which the Closing occurs, as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Purchaser Benefit Plan.

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate
Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to employ any employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for any period of time.

  

  

(c) No provision in this Section 10.6 shall: (i) create any third-party
beneficiary or other rights or remedies in any current or former employee,
director, officer, consultant, independent contractor or other service
provider (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any other Person other than the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; (ii) constitute or create an
employment agreement or rights to continued employment with Purchaser, the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates; or
(iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment, termination or
modification of any Benefit Plan, Purchaser Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Purchaser, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates.

  

  

(d) At least three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Purchaser with resolutions of the sponsoring company\'s board of
directors providing for the termination, effective as of immediately prior to
Closing, of all Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (unless Purchaser provides written notice to the Company no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing that any such Benefit
Plan shall not be terminated). The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and prior approval of Purchaser. In the event that
termination of any such Benefit Plan would reasonably be anticipated to
trigger liquidation or surrender charges, or other fees, then the Company
shall take (or cause to be taken) such actions as are necessary to reasonably
estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in
writing to Purchaser no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing.

  

  

10.7 Intentionally Omitted.

  

  

10.8 Investigation; No Reliance by Purchaser. Purchaser acknowledges that it
and its Representatives have undertaken an independent investigation and
verification of the business, assets, operations, financial condition and
prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. In connection with such
investigation, Purchaser and its Representatives have received from or on
behalf of the Sellers and/or the Company and the Company Subsidiaries certain
estimates, forecasts, plans and financial projections ("Forward-Looking
Statements"). Purchaser acknowledges that: (a) there are uncertainties
inherent in making Forward-Looking Statements; and (b) it is familiar with
such uncertainties and it is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Forward-Looking Statements so
furnished to it and its Representatives (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying Forward-Looking Statements where such assumptions are
explicitly disclosed). Except in the case of Fraud, none of the Sellers, the
Company nor any other Person shall have or be subject to any Liability to
Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser, or
its use of, Forward-Looking Statements.

  

  

10.9 Limitation of Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 6 and in Article 7
(including the Disclosure Schedule), the Company and the Sellers are not
making and shall not be liable for any other representations or warranties,
written or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 56 -  

  

 

 

  

  

oral, statutory, express or implied, concerning the Shares, the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or the business, assets or Liabilities of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company
nor the Sellers are making any representation or warranty to Purchaser with
respect to the information set forth in the Confidential Information
Memorandum prepared by the Company and previously delivered to Purchaser,
except if and to the extent such information is specifically included in this
Agreement or any Schedule to this Agreement.

 

  

  

10.10 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, (a) Seller Representative
and each Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives and
Affiliates (and their respective Representatives) to, (i) hold in confidence
any and all nonpublic information, whether written or oral, concerning the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including all customer lists, price
lists, marketing methods, technologies, processes, know-how or other trade
secrets, the terms of this Agreement and all non-public information that it
has acquired about the Purchaser and its respective Affiliates ("Company
Confidential Information") and (ii) not to, directly or indirectly, use any
Company Confidential Information for any reason or purpose other than for the
sole purpose of performing the Sellers\' obligations under this Agreement; and
(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates (and
their respective Representatives) to, hold in confidence the terms of this
Agreement and all information that it has acquired about the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, including the identity of any Seller or any direct or
indirect owner of any Seller ("Sellers' Confidential Information"), except, in
each case, to the extent that such Person can show that such Company
Confidential Information or Sellers' Confidential Information, as the case may
be: (i) is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of
such Person, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives, (ii)
is independently developed by such Person, any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives from and after the Closing without using the other
Person\'s confidential information or (iii) is acquired by such Person, any of
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from sources which are not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation (it being acknowledged and agreed that current and former
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have such a legal or
contractual obligation). If such Person or any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any Company Confidential
Information or Sellers' Confidential Information, as the case may be, by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such
Person shall promptly notify the Sellers\' Representative or the Purchaser, as
applicable, in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such Company
Confidential Information or Sellers' Confidential Information, as applicable,
which such Person is advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to
be disclosed; provided that such Person shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such Company Confidential Information
or Sellers' Confidential Information, as applicable. Any breach of the
confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 10.10 would cause
irreparable injury. Accordingly, each party agrees that the other party may
enforce the provisions hereof and, in addition to pursuing any other remedies
it may have in law or in equity, may seek an injunction against the breaching
party from any court having jurisdiction over the matter restraining any
violation by such party of its confidentiality without having to prove actual
damages. Each party agrees that the existence of any claim or cause of action
by it against the other party shall not constitute a defense to the
enforcement of such obligations.

  

  

10.11 Certification Regarding Tax Benefits. At the written request of the
Seller Representative, the Chief Financial Officer of Purchaser shall, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the request is made and after the information
is available, provide to the Seller Representative a certification of the
actual Tax Benefits realized in a calendar year with respect to any Damages
incurred in a calendar year for which any Seller has any indemnity obligation
under this Agreement.

11.3 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) If any Purchaser Indemnitee desires to make a claim against the Sellers or
any Seller Indemnitee desires to make a claim against Purchaser (such
Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitees an "Indemnified Party") under
Section 11.2 in connection with any action, suit, investigation, proceeding or
demand at any time instituted against or made upon the Indemnified Party by
any third party for which the Indemnified Party may seek indemnification
hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify in writing (i) in the case of a claim under Section 11.2(a), the Seller
Representative, (ii) in the case of a claim under Section 11.2(b), the
relevant Seller or (iii) in the case of a claim under Section 11.2(c),
Purchaser (in each case, an "Indemnifying Party") of such Third Party Claim
and of the Indemnified Party\'s claim of indemnification with respect thereto;
provided, that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party(ies) of their obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnified Party(ies) are materially prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnifying Party(ies) shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such
notice to notify such Indemnified Party if the applicable Indemnifying
Party(ies) (or, in the case of a claim under Section 11.2(a), the Seller
Representative on behalf of the Sellers) have elected to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim. If the applicable Indemnifying Party(ies) (or, in the
case of a claim under Section 11.2(a), the Seller Representative on behalf of
the Sellers) elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, such
Indemnifying Party(ies) (or, in the case of a claim under Section 11.2(a), the
Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) shall be entitled at their own
expense to conduct and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 59 -  

  

 

 

  

  

control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim through counsel
of their own choosing on behalf of the applicable Indemnified Party; provided,
that the counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of
such claim or litigation shall be subject to the approval of the Indemnified
Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); and provided further that the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected
by it (at the expense of the Indemnified Party) subject to the Indemnifying
Party\'s right to control the defense thereof; and provided further that if
and to the extent the Indemnifying Party cannot defend such Third Party Claim
on behalf of the Indemnifying Party as a result of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be
waived, then the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of one (1) counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
Party(ies) (or, in the case of a claim under Section 11.2(a), the Seller
Representative on behalf of the Sellers) fail to notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim that
the applicable Indemnifying Party(ies) (or, in the case of a claim under
Section 11.2(a), the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) have
elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim at the
expense of the applicable Indemnifying Party(ies); provided, that the
Indemnified Party may not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim except as
provided in Section 11.3(b).

 

  

  

(b) Any compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party Claim
shall require the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Unless
such consent is obtained, the applicable Indemnifying Party(ies) (or, in the
case of a claim under Section 11.2(a), the Seller Representative on behalf of
the Sellers) shall continue the defense of such claim; provided, that if any
Indemnified Party withholds its consent to a bona fide offer of settlement
that the applicable Indemnifying Party(ies) (or, in the case of a claim under
Section 11.2(a), the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) wish to
accept and that involves no payment of money by such Indemnified Party, and
further involves no injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the
Indemnified Party or otherwise limits the future operation of the business,
assets or property of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and that
releases such Indemnified Party from all Liability in connection with such
claim, the applicable Indemnifying Party(ies) (or, in the case of a claim
under Section 11.2(a), the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) may
reassign the defense of such claim to such Indemnified Party, who may then
continue to pursue the defense of such matter, free of any participation by
the Indemnifying Party(ies) (and, in the case of a claim under Section
11.2(a), the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers), at the sole cost
and expense of such Indemnified Party. In such event, the Liability of the
applicable Indemnifying Party(ies) with respect thereto shall not exceed the
amount of the offer of settlement that such Indemnified Party refused to
accept plus the costs and expenses of such Indemnified Party prior to the date
such Indemnifying Party(ies) (or, in the case of a claim under Section
11.2(a), the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) notified such
Indemnified Party of the offer of settlement.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or
other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

  

11.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Thresholds. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 11.4:

  

  

(i) Except to the extent a claim arises from Fraud on the part of a breaching
party, no claim for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than with
respect to Company Special Representations) shall be made by a Purchaser
Indemnitee with respect to any breach

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 60 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

  

   resulting in an individual item of Damages, or related items of Damages
arising out of substantially similar facts and circumstances, unless and until
the amount of the Damages suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitee in connection
with such breach exceeds $15,000 (the "Claim Threshold"), it being understood
that such Damages with respect to such breach may not be applied toward
satisfaction of the Deductible unless the amount of the Damages with respect
to such breach exceeds the Claim Threshold; and  
--- 
 

  

  

 

  

(ii) Except to the extent a claim arises from Fraud on the part of the
breaching party, no claim for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(i) (other
than with respect to Company Special Representations) shall be made by a
Purchaser Indemnitee unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages that
exceed the Claim Threshold for which Purchaser Indemnitees are otherwise
entitled to indemnification under this Article 11 exceeds $3,500,000 (the
"Deductible"), and then only to the extent the aggregate amount of all such
Damages exceeds the Deductible.

  

  

(b) Caps.

  

  

(i) The maximum aggregate amount of all Damages payable with respect to all
claims for indemnification hereunder pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) with
respect to the Company Special Representations shall not exceed $650,000,000
less the aggregate of all amounts previously paid or to be paid pursuant to
Sections 11.2(a)(i) and 11.2(a)(vi).

  

  

(ii) The maximum aggregate amount of all Damages payable with respect to all
claims for indemnification hereunder pursuant to (A) Section 11.2(a)(i) with
respect to representations and warranties of the Company other than the
Company Special Representations and (B) Section 11.2(a)(vi) shall not exceed
$97,500,000 less the aggregate of all amounts previously paid or to be paid
pursuant to Sections 11.2(a)(i) and 11.2(a)(vi).

  

  

(iii) The maximum aggregate amount of all Damages payable by any Seller with
respect to all claims with respect to indemnification hereunder pursuant to
Section 11.2(b)(i) shall not exceed an amount equal to $650,000,000 multiplied
by such Seller\'s Pro Rata Share less all amounts previously paid or to be
paid by such Seller pursuant to Section 11.2.

  

  

(c) Acknowledgment Regarding Seller Representations. The parties acknowledge
that the representations and warranties contained in Article 7 and the
covenants made by each Seller in this Agreement are made severally by each
Seller as to itself only, and any Seller who has breached any such
representation, warranty or covenant as to itself (but only such Seller)
shall, subject to the provisions of this Article 11, be liable with respect to
all Damages arising from the breach thereof.

  

  

(d) Time Limit. No Person shall be liable for any claim for indemnification
hereunder unless written notice of a claim for indemnification is delivered by
the Person seeking indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification is
sought with respect to any such breach before the date on which the
representation, warranty or covenant on which such claim is based ceases to
survive as set forth in Section 11.1 (in which case such indemnification
obligation shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate
pursuant to this Article 11 regardless of when any Damages in respect thereof
may actually be incurred). All notices given pursuant hereto shall set forth
with reasonable specificity the basis for such claim for indemnification.

  

  

(e) Closing Net Working Capital. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser for itself and each Purchaser Indemnitee
waives and releases, and Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for, any Damages arising from a

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 61 -  

  

 

 

  

  

breach of any representation or warranty of the Company under Article 6, and
the amount of any Damages incurred in respect of any such breach shall not be
included in the calculation of aggregate Damages subject to the Deductible, to
the extent that the amount of any Liability arising as a result of such breach
is expressly (i) disclosed or reflected and (ii) taken into account as a
current Liability for purposes of determining the Closing Net Working Capital
and such amount is included in the calculation of the Purchase Price (as
finally determined pursuant to Section 4.4). Without limiting the foregoing,
the determination of Closing Net Working Capital and the calculation of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 4.4 shall not be subject to any of the
limitations set forth in this Section 11.4.

 

  

  

(f) Insurance and Tax Benefits. The amount of any Damages subject to
indemnification by the Sellers hereunder shall be calculated (i) net of any
amounts that have been previously recovered or are recoverable by a Purchaser
Indemnitee under insurance policies or other collateral sources (such as
contractual indemnities of any Person that are contained outside this
Agreement), and (ii) net of any Tax Benefit.

  

  

(g) Mitigation. Purchaser Indemnitees shall take and shall cause their
Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming
aware of any event that gives rise to, or that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to, such Damages, including incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Damages.

  

  

(h) No Special Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in
this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person
for any damages other than direct damages, which shall exclude, to the extent
not constituting direct damages, any consequential, incidental, indirect,
special or punitive damages (including, for the avoidance of doubt, loss of
revenue or income, cost of capital, loss of profits, loss of goodwill or loss
of business reputation or opportunity to the extent not constituting direct
damages); provided, that, the limitations in this Section 11.4(h) shall not
apply to any otherwise excluded Damages that are awarded to, recovered or
recoverable by any third party that is not an Affiliate of the Person seeking
indemnification.

  

  

(i) No Multiple Recovery. No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover
any Damages relating to any breach of a representation or warranty or
otherwise arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that the
Purchaser Indemnitee has already recovered Damages with respect to such breach
pursuant to another representation, warranty or other provision of this
Agreement.

  

  

(j) Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification payments made
by Purchaser, the Company or any of the Sellers pursuant to this Article 11 or
pursuant to Section 10.4 shall be treated by all parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price hereunder.

  

  

(k) Tax Matters. Section 11.4(a) and Section 11.4(b) shall not apply to any
claim for indemnification with respect to Tax matters.

  

  

11.5 Other Limitations. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing: (a) Purchaser
shall have no recourse against the Company\'s officers, directors or agents
other than in their capacities as Sellers or as trustors, trustees or
beneficiaries of any trust that is a Seller or Optionholders; and (b)
indemnification owing from any Seller, such Seller\'s beneficial owner(s) or
such Person who is or was an officer or director of the Company shall not be
deemed for any purpose to be a claim covered by indemnification owing to such
Person by the Company under any Law, by-law or agreement whatsoever; and (c)
no Damages will be recoverable by any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to any
Products manufactured, distributed or sold later than the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to, arising out of, or relating
in any way to, any breach of the representations and warranties made in the
final

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 62 -  

  

 

 

  

  

sentence of Section 6.21(c) or the first sentence of Section 6.21(f);
provided, that the recoverability of any such Damages identified in this
clause (c) shall be subject to Purchaser complying in all material respects
with its obligations as identified in Item 3 of Schedule 11.2(a)

 

  

  

11.6 Limitation of Remedies. Except as provided in Section 10.4, or in
connection with the determination of Closing Net Working Capital and the
calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 4.4 or in instances of
Fraud, the rights of the parties for indemnification relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be strictly
limited to those contained in this Article 11 and, subject to the second to
last sentence of this Section 11.6 and except with respect to equitable
relief, such indemnification rights shall be the exclusive remedies of the
parties subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to any matter in any way
relating to this Agreement or arising in connection herewith. Except as
provided in Section 10.4, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, Purchaser
and the Company hereby waive and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
waive all other rights and remedies with respect to any such matter, whether
under any Laws (including any right or remedy under CERCLA or any other
Environmental, Health and Safety Law), at common law or otherwise. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict the bringing or
maintenance of any claim or action, or the granting of any remedy, to the
extent that the same shall have been the result of Fraud, and in the event of
Fraud, recourse shall only extend to those Persons committing Fraud. Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Sellers shall not be
liable to, and shall not indemnify, any Purchaser Indemnitee for any Damages
that result solely from the acts or omissions of a Purchaser Indemnitee or its
Affiliates, including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on or after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that this last sentence of this Section
11.6 shall not limit or alter the liability of any Seller to any Purchaser
Indemnitee with respect to the (a) the items identified in Schedule 11.2(a);
(b) Damages with respect to any Products manufactured, distributed or sold
prior to Closing or prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing
Date with respect to, arising out of, or relating in any way to, breaches of
representations and warranties made in the final sentence of Section 6.21(c)
or the first sentence of Section 6.21(f); provided, that the recoverability of
any such Damages identified in this clause (b) shall be subject to Purchaser
complying in all material respects with its obligations as identified in Item
3 of Schedule 11.2(a); or (c) for direct Damages as permitted under Section
11.4(h) caused by the breach of any representations or warranties made by any
of the Company or the Sellers (other than the representations and warranties
identified in the foregoing clause (b)), or with respect of any covenants to
be performed by any of them, prior to or as of the Closing.

  

  

11.7 Payment from Escrow. All indemnification obligations of the Sellers under
Section 10.4 or this Article 11 shall be satisfied first out of funds on
deposit in the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

11.8 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party\'s right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any
of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or
any of its Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the
Indemnified Party\'s waiver of any condition set forth in Section 9.1 or
Section 9.2, as the case may be.

  

  

ARTICLE 12

  

TERMINATION

  

  

12.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the

or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 63 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) by Purchaser by giving written notice to the Seller Representative at any
time (i) in the event any Seller or the Company has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in any
material respect, Purchaser has notified the Seller Representative of the
breach and the breach has continued uncured for a period of thirty (30) days
after the notice of breach or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before October 31, 2012, by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under Section 9.1 hereof, or, if the Closing has not occurred solely
because the conditions set forth in Section 9.1(e) have not been satisfied,
November 30, 2012 (unless the failure results primarily from Purchaser
breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement); or

  

  

(c) by the Seller Representative by giving written notice to Purchaser at any
time (i) in the event Purchaser has breached any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement in any material respect, the Seller
Representative has notified Purchaser of the breach and the breach has
continued uncured for a period of thirty (30) days after the notice of breach,
or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before October 31, 2012,
by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 9.2 hereof,
or, if the Closing has not occurred solely because the conditions set forth in
Section 9.2(d) have not been satisfied, November 30, 2012 (unless the failure
results primarily from a Seller or the Company breaching any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement).

  

  

12.2 Effect of Termination. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1 shall terminate all obligations of the parties hereunder, without
liability of any party to any other party (except for the liability of any
party then in breach), except for the obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement (which shall survive in accordance with the terms thereof) and this
Section 12.2.

  

  

  

ARTICLE 13

  

MATTERS RELATING TO SELLER REPRESENTATIVE

  

  

13.1 Appointment of the Seller Representative. Each Seller does hereby
irrevocably appoint the individual executing a joinder agreement to this
Agreement on and as of the date hereof as the initial "Seller Representative"
as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of
substitution or re-substitution, to act on behalf of such Seller with respect
to the transfer of the Shares owned by such Seller to Purchaser in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and to act on behalf of such
Seller in any litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement (other than
any litigation or arbitration involving the indemnification obligation of such
Seller under Section 11.2(b)), to do or refrain from doing all such further
acts and things, and to execute all such documents as the Seller
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the power:

  

  

(a) to act for such Seller with regard to matters pertaining to
indemnification referred to in this Agreement (other than any indemnification
obligation of such Seller under Section 11.2(b)), including the power to
compromise any indemnity claim on behalf of such Seller and to transact
matters of litigation (other than with respect to indemnification obligations
of such Seller under Section 11.2(b));

  

  

(b) to execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
stock powers, certificates and documents that the Seller Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(c) to receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 64 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) to receive funds for the payment of expenses of such Seller and apply such
funds in payment for such expenses;

  

  

(e) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of such
Seller that the Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate in his or
her sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully
and completely as such Seller could do if personally present;

  

  

(f) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement and to act for such Seller
with regard to all matters pertaining to the Escrow Agreement; and

  

  

(g) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

  

  

The appointment of the Seller Representative shall be deemed coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable, and Purchaser, the Company and any other
Person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action
of the Seller Representative in all matters referred to herein. Any action
taken by the Seller Representative must be in writing signed by the Seller
Representative. All notices required to be made or delivered by Purchaser to
the Sellers described above in this Section 13.1 shall be made to the Seller
Representative for the benefit of such Sellers and shall discharge in full all
notice requirements of Purchaser to such Sellers with respect thereto. The
Seller Representative shall promptly provide the applicable Sellers with
copies of all such notices. The Sellers hereby confirm all that the Seller
Representative shall do or cause to be done by virtue of his or her
appointment as the representative of the Sellers hereunder. The Seller
Representative shall act for the Sellers on all of the matters set forth in
this Agreement in the manner the Seller Representative believes to be in the
best interest of the Sellers and consistent with the obligations of the
Sellers under this Agreement, but the Seller Representative shall not be
responsible to any Seller for any loss or damages that such Seller may suffer
by the performance of the Seller Representative\'s duties under this
Agreement, other than loss or damages arising from intentional violations of
Law or gross negligence in the performance of such duties under this
Agreement. The Seller Representative shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or shall otherwise exist against
the Seller Representative.

  

  

13.2 Reliance by the Seller Representative. The Seller Representative shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any statements
furnished to it by any Seller, Purchaser or the Company, or any other evidence
reasonably deemed by the Seller Representative to be reliable, and the Seller
Representative shall be entitled to act on the advice of counsel selected by
him. The Seller Representative shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under this Agreement unless he shall have received such
advice or concurrence of any Seller as he deems appropriate or he shall have
been expressly indemnified to his or her satisfaction by the Sellers
(severally as to each Seller only and not jointly as to or with any other
Seller) according to their respective Pro Rata Shares against any and all
Liability and expense that the Seller Representative may incur by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action. The Seller Representative shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, under
this Agreement in accordance with a request of Sellers whose aggregate Pro
Rata Shares exceeds fifty percent (50%), and such request, and any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto, shall be binding upon all of the
Sellers to the extent otherwise permitted hereunder.

  

  

13.3 Expenses of the Seller Representative. The Seller Representative shall be
entitled to retain counsel and to incur such expenses (including court costs
and reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) as the Seller Representative
deems to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of his
or her obligations under this Agreement, and all such fees and expenses
incurred by

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 65 -  

  

 

 

  

  

the Seller Representative shall be borne by the Sellers (severally as to each
Seller only and not jointly as to or with any other Seller) according to their
respective Pro Rata Shares.

 

  

  

13.4 Indemnification. The Sellers hereby agree (severally as to each Seller
only and not jointly as to or with any other Seller) to indemnify the Seller
Representative (in his or her capacity as such) ratably according to their
respective Pro Rata Shares against, and to hold the Seller Representative (in
his or her capacity as such) harmless from, any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of whatever kind which may at any time be imposed
upon, incurred by or asserted against the Seller Representative in such
capacity in any way relating to or arising out of the Seller Representative\'s
action or failure to take action pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
herewith in such capacity; provided, that no Seller shall be liable for the
payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting solely from the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the
Seller Representative or any violation by the Seller Representative of his or
her obligations under this Agreement. The agreements in this Article 13 shall
survive termination of this Agreement.

  

  

13.5 Substitute Seller Representative. If the individual appointed pursuant to
Section 13.1 shall die, become disabled, resign or otherwise be unable to
fulfill his or her responsibilities as agent of the Sellers, then the Sellers
whose aggregate Pro Rata Shares exceeds 50.0% shall, as soon as practicable
and with Purchaser's written approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), appoint a successor agent for
the Sellers. The Seller Representative may resign at any time by written
notice to Purchaser and the Sellers. All power, authority, rights and
privileges conferred in this Agreement to the initial Seller Representative
shall apply to any successor Seller Representative.

  

  

13.6 Reliance by Purchaser. Purchaser and the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may rely on the appointment and authority of the Seller Representative
granted pursuant to this Article 13 until receipt of written notice of the
appointment of a successor Seller Representative made in accordance with
Section 13.5. In so doing, Purchaser and the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to deal exclusively with and may rely conclusively
(without further evidence whatsoever) on any and all actions taken by and
decisions of the Seller Representative on any matter relating to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

14.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 1, 2012 between Purchaser and Houlihan
Lokey Capital, Inc., as agent for the Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
subject matter set forth herein and therein and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to such subject matter. In
the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement and those in the Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and Disclosure
Schedule (other than an exception expressly set forth in such Disclosure
Schedule), the statements in the body of this Agreement shall control.

  

  

14.3 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by the Seller Representative, the Company and
Purchaser, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 67 -  

  

 

 

  

  

the waiver is to be effective. No waiver by any party shall operate or be
construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not
expressly identified in a written waiver, whether of a similar or different
character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall any amendment to this Agreement that would
increase the liability or potential liability of any Seller hereunder or amend
the provisions of Article 13 be effective as against such Seller without the
written consent of such Seller to such amendment.

 

  

  

14.4 Benefits; Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs,
successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor the obligations
of any party hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by such party
without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided, that (a)
Purchaser and, after the Closing, the Company shall each have the right to
assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates and to
any purchaser of a material portion of its assets, so long as such party
remains liable for such Affiliate\'s or purchaser\'s obligations hereunder and
(b) Purchaser and, after the Closing, the Company may each assign its rights
hereunder for collateral security purposes to any lender or lenders (including
any agent for any such lender or lenders) providing financing to Purchaser in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to any
assignee or assignees of any such lender, lenders or agent.

  

  

14.5 No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as provided in Section 10.5(b),
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be
interpreted to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, the Purchaser
Indemnitees, the Sellers, the Seller Indemnitees, the Seller Representative
and their respective successors, heirs, personal representatives or permitted
assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

14.6 Severability. The parties desire and intend that the provisions of this
Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and
public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall
be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more
narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such
jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

14.7 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, the parties shall bear their own respective expenses (including
all compensation and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, consultants,
actuaries and independent accountants) incurred in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution and consummation of this Agreement and of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have incurred certain of the costs and expenses of the
Sellers in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) such costs and expenses shall be included in the
Company Transaction Expenses and shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining the Purchase Price payable at Closing pursuant to Section 4.3(b).
Purchaser shall not have any Liability for any such costs or expenses of the
Sellers after the Closing. Purchaser shall be

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 68 -  

  

 

 

  

  

responsible for any filing or similar fees in connection with any filings or
submissions under the HSR Act.

 

  

  

14.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be deemed
to be one and the same instrument. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered
by facsimile or electronic mail shall have the same legal effect as delivery
of an original signed copy of this Agreement.

  

  

14.9 Purchaser\'s Review.

  

  

(a) Purchaser has reviewed and has had access to all documents, records and
information that it has desired to review, and has had the opportunity to ask
questions in connection with its decision to enter into this Agreement, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser has not relied upon,
and Purchaser expressly waives and releases Sellers from any Liability for any
claims relating to or arising from, any representation, warranty, statement,
advice, document, projection, or other information of any type provided by the
Sellers or their Affiliates or any of their representatives, except for those
representations and warranties of the Company and Sellers expressly set forth
in Article 6 and Article 7. In deciding to enter into this Agreement, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser has
relied solely upon its own knowledge, investigation, judgment and analysis
(and that of its Representatives) and not on any disclosure or representation
made by, or any duty to disclose on the part of, Sellers, their Affiliates or
any of their Representatives, other than the express representations and
warranties of the Company and Sellers set forth in Article 6 and Article 7.

  

  

(b) Any and all duties and obligations that any party hereto may have to any
other party hereto with respect to or in connection with the Shares, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are limited to
those specifically set forth in this Agreement. Neither the duties nor
obligations of any party, nor the rights of any party, shall be expanded
beyond the terms of this Agreement on the basis of any legal or equitable
principle or on any other basis whatsoever. Neither any equitable or legal
principle nor any implied obligation of good faith or fair dealing nor any
other matter requires any party to incur, suffer or perform any act, condition
or obligation contrary to the terms of this Agreement, whether or not existing
and whether foreseeable or unforeseeable. Each of the parties acknowledges
that it would be unfair, and that it does not intend, to increase any of the
obligations of any other party under this Agreement on the basis of any
implied obligation or otherwise.

  

  

14.10 Remedies Cumulative. Except as set forth in Section 11.6, no remedy made
available by any of the provisions of this Agreement is intended to be
exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative
and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity.

  

  

14.11 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE
OF LAW OR CONFLICTING PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON OR
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER
THAN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON TO BE APPLIED. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING,
THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON SHALL CONTROL THE INTERPRETATION
AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF UNDER SUCH JURISDICTION\'S CHOICE
OF

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 69 -  

  

 

  LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW ANALYSIS, THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION WOULD ORDINARILY APPLY.

 

  

  

(b) ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR BASED ON
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
HEARD AND/OR TRIED IN WASHINGTON, AND EACH PARTY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS LOCATED IN WASHINGTON. SERVICE OF
PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO A PARTY\'S ADDRESS AS
SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD
OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

  

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE OUT
OF, RELATE TO OR BE BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES.
ACCORDINGLY, EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH PARTY MAY LEGALLY AND
EFFECTIVELY DO SO, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF, RELATING TO OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT.

  

  

(d) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (ii) SUCH
PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) SUCH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN SECTION 14.11(c) AND THIS SECTION 14.11(d).

  

  

14.12 Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to this
Agreement to any other party under this Agreement, which obligation is
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be
deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

  

  

14.13 Interpretation. As used in this Agreement: (a) the words "include,"
"includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words
