shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement, then the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party shall be entitled in addition to, and not in limitation of, any
other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity including monetary damages (but only to the extent expressly permitted by <U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U> or <U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U>), to seek and obtain in the courts contemplated by
<U>Section&nbsp;8.8</U> (a)&nbsp;a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b)&nbsp;the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity
of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief. Each party
further agrees not to assert that any of the foregoing remedies is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to object to such a remedy on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance of Parent&#146;s obligation to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions if and only if
(i)&nbsp;all conditions in <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;6.2</U> have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied at such time), (ii)&nbsp;no Financing Failure has occurred or is occurring and (iii)&nbsp;the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Debt Financing is funded, then the Closing pursuant to <U>Article I</U> will occur. Each
