Articles of Merger and the applicable provisions of the VSCA.

1.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Organizational Documents of the Company in effect immediately prior to the

(c) intends to maintain the Companys and its Subsidiaries brand and to

ARTICLE II 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

 

OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB

 

2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or the holder
of any of the parties securities:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall represent one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article II_ , each share of
common stock of the Company, no par value (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any
shares described in clause (iii) of this _Section 2.1(b)_) shall
automatically be converted into and shall thereafter represent solely the
right to receive $88.25 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock shall, when so converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(i)_, cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist. At the Effective Time, each
holder of a share of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration and
(B) any "stub period" cash dividend declared in accordance with _Section
4.1(b)(i)_ in each case to be paid upon surrender of any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable in accordance with _Section 2.3_.

(iii) Any shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (A) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or held in the
Companys treasury) or (B) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in each case, shall automatically be canceled and cease to
exist as of the Effective Time and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable therefor.

 

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, etc_. In the event of any change in the number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time by reason of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,

 



3  subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or other similar transaction or event, the Merger Consideration to be
paid for each share of Company Common Stock and the consideration, as
described in _Section 2.2_, to be paid for each Company Equity Award shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
party to effect any such change that is not otherwise specifically authorized
or permitted by this Agreement.

 

2.2 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) With respect to each award of performance shares that was granted under
any Company Stock Plan prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Pre-
Signing Company Performance Share Awards_ ") and each award of performance
units that was granted under any Company Stock Plan prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Pre-Signing Company Performance Unit Awards_ " and,
together with the Pre-Signing Company Performance Share Awards, the " _Pre-
Signing Company Equity Awards_ "), each such Pre-Signing Company Equity Award
that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not then vested and exercisable, shall not be assumed, continued or
substituted but shall, as of the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of a holder thereof, automatically become
fully vested, and each such Pre-Signing Company Equity Award, whether payable
in cash or shares of Company Common Stock, shall be canceled in consideration
for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to (i)
with respect to any Pre-Signing Company Performance Share Awards, the product
of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Pre-Signing Company Performance Share Award and (ii)
with respect to any Pre-Signing Company Performance Unit Awards, the product
of (A) $1.00 and (B) the number of performance units represented by such Pre-
Signing Company Performance Unit Award, in each case, subject to the
following: (1) with respect to each such Pre-Signing Company Equity Award
that is subject to a relative total shareholder return (" _Relative TSR_ ")
performance condition, the number of shares or units, as applicable,
represented by such Pre-Signing Company Equity Award shall be based upon the
greater of (x) satisfaction of such performance condition at the Companys
actual percentile position as of the date on which the Effective Time occurs
(determined without regard to any four-quarter averaging mechanism) or (y)
deemed satisfaction of such performance condition at the target level; and (2)
with respect to each such Pre-Signing Company Equity Award that is subject to
a performance condition other than Relative TSR, the number of shares or
units, as applicable, represented by such Pre-Signing Company Equity Award
shall be based upon deemed satisfaction of applicable performance conditions
at the target level. As of the Effective Time, all dividends, if any,
accrued but unpaid with respect to such Pre-Signing Company Equity Awards
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of a holder
thereof, automatically become fully vested and be paid to such holder.

 

(b) Each award of performance shares or performance units that is granted
under any Company Stock Plan after the date of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 4.1(b)(x)_ (the " _Post-Signing Company Awards_ ") and that
remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated
in connection with the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the
terms set forth in _Section 4.1(b)(x)(7)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) shall take such action and adopt such resolutions as are
required to (i) effectuate the treatment of the outstanding Pre-Signing
Company Equity Awards and the outstanding Post-Signing Company Awards
(collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") set forth in this _Section
2.2_, (ii) give effect to the transactions contemplated in this _Section 2.2_
and (iii) ensure that after the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Equity
Award shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the Company
or Parent or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to such Company
Equity Award, except as provided in this  _Section 2.2_.

 



4 (d) Not later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, all
funds necessary to fulfill the obligations under _Section 2.2(a)_. All
payments required under this _Section 2.2_ shall be made through the
Companys or the Surviving Corporations, as applicable, payroll not later
than the first payroll date following the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such payroll date is less than three (3) Business Days
after to the Closing Date, such payment will be made on the next following
payroll date.

2.3 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
designate a national bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to act as paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration and will enter into an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
Company with the Paying Agent relating to the services to be performed by the
Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall irrevocably
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, the aggregate Merger
Consideration with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_) (the " _Payment Fund_ ").

 

(b) The aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall,
pending its disbursement to holders of shares of Company Common Stock and as
reasonably directed by Parent, be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) short-
term commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Laws of a
state of the U.S., rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the U.S. is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, or in mutual funds investing in such assets. Any
interest or other income resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall
become part of the Payment Fund. No investment or investment losses resulting
from such investment by the Paying Agent of the aggregate Merger Consideration
shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from
making the payments required by this _Section 2.3_, and Parent shall promptly
replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any investment
made pursuant to this _Section 2.3_. No investment by the Paying Agent of
the aggregate Merger Consideration shall have maturities that could prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the Effective
Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Paying Agent, from time to time
as needed, additional cash to pay the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this _Section 2.3_ without interest solely in the event the Payment Fund has
insufficient cash to make any payments of the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

(c) The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ out of the Payment
Fund. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the
Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger
Consideration.

 

(d) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to each holder of record, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, of (A) an outstanding certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) if required by the
processes and procedures of the

 



5  Paying Agent, shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, if
applicable, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by the
parties prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration. Each
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter until the first
(1st) anniversary of the Effective Time surrender such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, as agent for such holder, under cover of the
Letter of Transmittal, if applicable.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares,
together with the Letter of Transmittal, if applicable, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the holder of record of such shares of Company Common Stock, it shall be
a condition of payment that such shares of Company Common Stock so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.3(d)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
of and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing shares of Company Common Stock
described in  _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_).

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other income resulting from the investment of the Payment
Fund) that remains undistributed to the former shareholders of the Company in
accordance with this _Article II_ on the 365th day after the Closing Date
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and thereafter
Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Article II_ shall look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws) for payment of their claim for such amounts.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount of Merger

 



6  Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is
immediately prior to the time at which the Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than a
Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in _Section
2.1(b)(iii)_) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate,
pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article II_.

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct or withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from the
amounts otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or any holder
of a Company Equity Award pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to
be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or the holder of the
Company Equity Award, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to establish or obtain any
exemption from or reduction in the amount of any withholding that otherwise
would be required.

2.4 _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA,
no dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the
Transactions.

this Agreement), the Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and none

any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement
or any similar Contract, including any Contract relating to any transaction,
arrangement or relationship between or among the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of

is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of
its properties, makes such qualification necessary, except in each case as has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Authority; No Violations_.

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub (including by the Parent Board
and the Merger Sub Board) and approved by Intermediate Parent. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub, and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to
Creditors Rights. No vote or approval of the holders of any class or series
of capital stock of Parent is necessary to adopt or approve this Agreement and
the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
does not, and the consummation of the Transactions by Parent and Merger Sub
will not at the Effective Time (A) conflict with or violate any provision of
the Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (B) result in any
violation or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or acceleration of any obligation or the loss, suspension, limitation
or impairment of a benefit under (or right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to own or use any assets or properties required for the conduct
of their respective businesses), or result in (or give rise to) the creation
of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) or any rights of
termination, cancellation, first offer or first refusal, in each case, with
respect to any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any provision of any Contract to which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective properties or assets are bound that is required to be filed
by Parent on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval by the
applicable Canadian securities regulators pursuant to any Canadian securities
Laws; or (C) assuming that each of the Consents referred to in _Section
3.2(c)_ are duly and timely obtained or made and any applicable waiting
periods referred to therein have expired or terminated, violate any Law
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (B) or (C), as has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



21 (c) _Consents_. No Consent is required to be obtained or made by Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions, except for (i) the filing of a premerger
notification report by Parent under the HSR Act, and the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period with respect thereto; (ii) the
filing with the SEC of such reports under the Exchange Act and such other
compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, as
may be required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, (iii)

filings required under, and compliance with other applicable requirements of
the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Securities Commissions; (v)
the CFIUS Approval and any filings with respect thereto; (vi) any such
Consents required for the State Regulatory Approvals and any filings with
respect thereto; (vii) the FERC Approval and any filings with respect
thereto; and (viii) any such Consents the failure to obtain or make of which
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) _Information Supplied_. The information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will not,
at the time of filing with the SEC, at the date first mailed to the
shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

(e) _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any
such Proceedings that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
There is no Order outstanding against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in
either case that has had and would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(f)  _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company complete and correct
fully executed copies, as of the date hereof, of (i) the Debt Commitment
Letter and (ii) all fee letters related thereto (as redacted to remove only
the fee amounts, pricing caps, time periods, the rates and economic terms of
the "market flex,"), in each case, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments to such letters in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Debt Letters_ "), pursuant to which and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, the lenders parties thereto have committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent (the provision of such funds as
set forth therein, " _Debt Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect (subject, as to
enforceability, to Creditors Rights) and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, and there are no conditions precedent related to the funding
of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Letters.
Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Letters, Parent and Merger Sub will have available at the Closing all of
the funds required for (A) the aggregate Merger Consideration, (B) the amounts
contemplated by _Section 2.2_, and (C) other payment obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub hereunder, and such will be used, to the extent required to
consummate the Transactions, to consummate the Merger pursuant to _Article
II_. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a material breach or
default on the part of Parent, or to the knowledge of Parent, any other party
under the Debt Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, except for
any agreements relating to any alternative equity capital markets financing
(which agreements do not contain any terms that would adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, termination,

 



22  principal amount or availability of the Debt Financing), there are no side
letters or other agreements, Contracts, arrangements or understandings
(written or oral) related to the funding of the Debt Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Letters. Parent has fully paid (or has made
arrangements to fully pay or cause to be fully paid as promptly as
practicable) all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on
or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing.
As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have knowledge that the Debt
Financing will not be made available on the Closing Date.

 

(g) _Share Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, individually or, to
Parents knowledge, together with its "affiliates" and "associates" (as such
terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), a "beneficial owner" (as
such term is defined in the Company Articles of Incorporation) of a number of
shares of Company Common Stock equal to or greater than ten percent (10%) of
the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(h) _Brokers_. Except for the fees and expenses payable to J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada and certain
of their respective Affiliates, no broker, investment banker or other Person
is entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the Transactions (other than in connection with
any Financing) based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(i) _Ownership and No Business Conduct of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was
incorporated on January 20, 2017. Parent owns beneficially and of record all
of the outstanding capital stock of AltaGas Services (U.S.) Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _U.S. Holdco_ "), US Holdco owns beneficially and of record
all of the outstanding membership interests in Wrangler 1 LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Wrangler 1_ "), and Wrangler 1 owns beneficially
and of record all of the outstanding membership interests in Intermediate
Parent. Parent owns beneficially, and Intermediate Parent owns of record, all
of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub, all of which is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Since
its incorporation, Merger Sub has not engaged in any activity, other than
such actions in connection with (i) its organization and (ii) the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the Transactions. Merger Sub
has no operations, has not generated any revenues and has no liabilities
other than those incurred in connection with the foregoing and in association
with the Merger as provided in this Agreement.

 

(j) _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plans and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, that Parent and Merger Sub are making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans and cost-related plans, furnished to them (including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information, business plans or cost-related plans), and that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, or any other
Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other Person, has
made or is making any representation or warranty or has or shall have any
liability (whether pursuant to this Agreement, in tort or otherwise) with
respect to such estimates, projections, 

 



23  forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-
related plans), except as expressly set forth in _Section 3.1_.

27 4.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers and employees to and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, immediately cease and
terminate any existing solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Person
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Competing
Proposal or any proposal, offer or indication of interest that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal and request, and use
its reasonable best efforts to enforce its contractual rights with respect to,
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished to any such Person in connection with a Competing Proposal and
terminate access by any such Person to any physical or electronic data room
maintained by or on behalf of the Company. 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers and employees and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any proposals, offers
or indications of interest regarding, or the making of any proposal, offer or
indication of interest that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Competing Proposal, (ii) conduct, participate or engage in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Competing
Proposal or any proposal, offer or indication of interest that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal (except to notify such
Person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 4.2_), or (iii)
furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries
to any Person in connection with or in response to a Competing Proposal or any
proposal, offer or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Competing Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval the Company or its Representatives receives a
bona fide written Competing Proposal, the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof), the Company and its Representatives may engage in the
activities prohibited by _Section 4.2(b)_ with any Person who has made such
Competing Proposal if (i) such Competing Proposal did not result from a
material breach of this  _Section 4.2_, (ii) prior to engaging in any such
activities, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and independent financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal is, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
engage in such activities would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (iii) prior to furnishing any
non-public information, the Company receives an executed confidentiality and
standstill agreement from such Person (A) containing terms that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that such agreement may permit the
submission of a Competing Proposal to the Company Board on a confidential and
non-public basis) and (B) not prohibiting the Company from complying with its
obligations set forth in this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall enter into any Contract that prohibits the Company from
complying with any of its obligations pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ or 
_Section 5.3_.

practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) of the receipt of any
Competing Proposal or any request for non-public information regarding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries made by any Person or any request for
negotiations with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives in connection with a Competing Proposal,
and, in respect of each such Competing Proposal or request, the Company shall
provide to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within such 24 hour timeframe) the identity of the Person making such
Competing Proposal or

 



28  request and the material terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal or
request (and provide copies of any such written correspondence related
thereto). The Company shall keep Parent informed as promptly as reasonable
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours of such material development or
change) of the status, material communications (and provide copies of any such
written correspondence related thereto) and material developments regarding
any Competing Proposal or request (including any change in the price or other
material terms or conditions thereof). The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent
any non-public information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any other Person in connection with a Competing Proposal that was
not previously provided to Parent.

 

(e) The Company shall inform all of its Representatives of the restrictions
described in this _Section 4.2_ and  _Section 5.3_. The Company agrees that
any action that is taken by (i) its Subsidiaries or its and their respective
directors, officers and employees that, if taken by the Company, would have
been a breach of this  _Section 4.2_ or _Section 5.3_, or (ii) any other
Representative of the Company that, if taken by the Company, would have been a
Willful and Material Breach of this _Section 4.2_ or _Section 5.3_, in
each case, shall be deemed to be a breach of such Section by the Company.

(f) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
terminate, amend, modify or waive, or fail to enforce against any Person to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any provision of any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) unless
the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that compliance with
the terms of this  _Section 4.2(f)_ would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

5.1 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (a) afford to
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, at reasonable times upon
reasonable prior notice, to (i) the officers, key employees, Representatives,
properties, offices and other facilities (but excluding for the conduct of
any Phase II testing or sampling of environmental media) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including by way of in person or telephonic meetings between
the Company and its Representatives and Parent and its Representatives)
and (ii) their books, records, documents and Contracts, and (b) furnish as
promptly as reasonably practicable to Parent, its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives such information concerning the Companys and its
Subsidiaries business, properties, Contracts, records and personnel as may
be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of Parent (other
than any publicly available document filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries
with the SEC). Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to, or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to Parent, its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives to the extent that doing so would
violate applicable Law or breach an obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third party, or in the good faith determination of the Company would
jeopardize the protection of attorney-client or attorney work-product
privilege or expose such party to risk of liability for disclosure of
sensitive or personal information ( _provided_  that, in such case, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such access or
information (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in
the events set out in this sentence). Parent agrees that it shall not,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ for any
purpose unrelated to the Transactions. The

 



29  Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, all information furnished
thereunder or hereunder to Parent may be furnished by Parent and its
Subsidiaries to their Representatives.

 

5.2 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Information Supplied; Company
Shareholders Meeting_.

 

(a) Each party shall cooperate with the other party in the preparation of the
preliminary and the definitive Proxy Statement, including all amendments or
supplements thereto. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
preliminary Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event no later than forty-five (45) days) following the date of this
Agreement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement
will be made by the Company without first providing Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company shall consider in
good faith all reasonable additions, deletions and changes suggested by
Parent in connection therewith. The Company shall notify Parent of the receipt
of any comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement
and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to Parent, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, copies of all written correspondence between the Company or any
of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. If
any comments are received from the staff of the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to such comments. Parent and Merger Sub shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, provide the Company with such information
as may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement or as may be
reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC. As promptly as
reasonably practicable after all comments received from the staff of the SEC
have been cleared by the SEC, the Company shall file the definitive Proxy
Statement with the SEC and cause such definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to its shareholders of record, as of a record date reasonably established by
the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) in accordance with
applicable Law. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the
Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and the
Company shall promptly file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the shareholders
of the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and its Organizational Documents to duly give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the
Companys shareholders (and in any event shall convene such meeting no later
than forty-five (45) days after mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement);
_provided_ that the Company shall not adjourn, postpone, recess or cancel (or
propose, publicly or otherwise, or resolve to, to adjourn, postpone, recess or
cancel) the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent, except that the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company
Shareholders Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys
shareholders for a period of time determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) to be required by applicable Law or (ii) if, as of
the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Company
Shareholders Meeting or to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval;
_provided_ , that no adjournment or postponement of the Company Shareholders
Meeting shall delay the date of the Company Shareholders

 



30  Meeting to a date that is more than twenty (20) Business Days after the date
for which the Company Shareholders Meeting was previously scheduled (it being
understood that such Company Shareholders Meeting shall be adjourned or
postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)
or (ii) exist); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Shareholders
Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or after three (3)
Business Days prior to the Outside Date. The Companys obligation to give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance
with this _Section 5.2(b)_ shall not be affected by the commencement,
proposal, disclosure, or announcement of any Competing Proposal or any Adverse
Recommendation Change. No Adverse Recommendation Change shall, in and of
itself, be deemed to affect the validity of the Company Boards approval of
the Companys execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement for
purposes of the VSCA, and without in any way limiting the right of the Company
Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall rescind or amend the Company Boards approval of the Companys
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. Until there has been
an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.3(b)_ or
_Section 5.3(c)_, (A) the Company shall solicit from shareholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and use
its reasonable best efforts to secure the required Company Shareholder
Approval, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable, and (B) the
Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Competing Proposal and
shall not include any matter other than the approval of this Agreement or
matters related to the Transactions at the Company Shareholders Meeting. If
requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent each voting
tabulation report relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting that has been
prepared by the Company or the Companys transfer agent, proxy solicitor or
other Representatives.

 

5.3 _Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly permitted by _Section 5.3(b)_ or _Section
5.3(c)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof may (i) (A)
withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in a manner adverse to Parent,
or propose publicly to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) recommend,
adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any
Competing Proposal or (C) in the event a tender offer that constitutes a
Competing Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act is
commenced, fail to recommend against such Competing Proposal in a solicitation
or recommendation statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business
Days (any action described in this _Section 5.3(a)(i)_ being referred to as
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, scheme of
arrangement agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or
that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)_).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
if the Company has received a Competing Proposal (other than as a result of a
material breach of _Section 4.2_ or this _Section 5.3_) and the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has determined in good faith,
(x) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (y) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the receipt
of such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the 

 



31  Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall not be entitled
to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
this _Section 5.3(b)_ unless (i) the Company has provided to Parent at least
four (4) Business Days prior notice of its intent to take such action (which
notice shall (A) include a copy of the proposed transaction agreements with
the Person making such Superior Proposal, and specify the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal, and (B) inform Parent that the Company
intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change at the end of the
Superior Proposal Notice Period) (such notice being referred to herein as a "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any such
Superior Proposal Notice shall not in itself be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change); (ii) if requested to do so by Parent, the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during the period starting on the first (1st) Business Day
following Parents receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice and ending at
11:59 p.m., Washington, D.C. time on the fourth (4th) Business Day following
such receipt (such period, a " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "),
regarding any changes or modifications Parent proposes to make to the terms of
this Agreement such that it would cause such Competing Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal; and (iii) at the end of such Superior
Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors and taking into
account any changes or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent to the Company in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, that
such Competing Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal. The parties
agree that any amendment to the price or other material amendment to the
terms of a Superior Proposal following the delivery of a Superior Proposal
Notice in respect of such Superior Proposal shall require delivery of another
Superior Proposal Notice to which the provisions of clauses (i)-(iii) of this
_Section 5.3(b)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ except that, in the case of
such Superior Proposal Notice with respect to an amended Superior Proposal,
any references to four (4) Business Days in such clauses shall be deemed to
be two (2) Business Days.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) may, in response to an Intervening Event,
make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_ unless (i) the Company has provided
to Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior notice of its intent to take
such action (which notice shall (A) provide a reasonably detailed description
of the Intervening Event and (B) inform Parent that the Company intends to
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change at the end of the Intervening
Event Notice Period) (such notice being referred to herein as an "
_Intervening Event Notice_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any such
Intervening Event Notice shall not in itself be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change); (ii) if requested to do so by Parent, the Company
has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good
faith with Parent during the period starting on the first (1st) Business Day
following Parents receipt of the Intervening Event Notice and ending at
11:59 p.m., Washington, D.C. time on the fourth (4th) Business Day following
such receipt (such period, an " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "),
regarding any changes or modifications Parent proposes to make to the terms of
this Agreement such that it would obviate the need for making an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event; and (iii) at the
end of such Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any
changes or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to
the Company in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, that failure to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



32 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i)
making any disclosure in compliance with its obligations required under Rules
14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that, for
purposes of clarity, any such disclosure having the effect contemplated by
Section 5.3(a)(i) shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii)
making any disclosure to its shareholders in connection with a Competing
Proposal if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after
consultation with outside legal counsel), failure to so disclose would
reasonably be expected to constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_
that any such disclosure that fails to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation shall be deemed to constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change
or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the shareholders
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (which
communication shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change).

5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall
use its respective reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Transactions to
be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable (including by using
reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article VI_ to be satisfied), (ii) make as promptly as
reasonably practicable any necessary submissions and filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws or to Governmental Authorities in order to consummate the
Transactions, (iii) cooperate with the other party and promptly furnish
information necessary in connection with such submissions and filings to such
Governmental Authorities or under such Antitrust Laws, (iv) keep the other
party reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such submissions
and filings to such Governmental Authorities or under such Antitrust Laws and
(v) obtain all actions or non-actions, approvals, consents, waivers,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority (including the Regulatory Approvals) necessary to
consummate the Transactions.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this _Section 5.4_, each party shall (i) make
a filing of a premerger notification report pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within twenty-one (21) days after the date hereof), (ii) make any
required filings in connection with Regulatory Approvals as promptly as
reasonably practicable, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material (other than information
subject to attorney-client or attorney work-product privilege) that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or by the State Commissions, CFIUS or FERC,
as applicable, in connection with the Regulatory Approvals and (iv) use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this _Section 5.4_ as may be necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
(including any extensions thereof) and to obtain the Regulatory Approvals as
promptly as reasonably practicable.

 

(c) Each party shall, subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information: (i) give the other party notice as promptly as reasonably
practicable of (and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of) any
communication received or sent by such party from or to any Governmental
Authority (or any other Person participating or intervening in any Proceeding
by or before any Governmental Authority) regarding any filings,
investigation, or inquiry concerning the Transactions, and permit the other
party to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the other party in relation to) any proposed written
response to any such communication, (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed of any developments, meetings or discussions with any

 



33  Governmental Authority (or any other Person participating or intervening in
any Proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority) in respect of any
filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the Transactions and (iii) not
independently participate in any meeting or discussions with a Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the
Transactions without giving the other party prior notice of such meeting or
discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate; _provided_ , that the parties shall be
permitted to redact any correspondence, filing, submission or communication
to the extent such correspondence, filing, submission or communication
contains competitively sensitive information, including information relating
to the valuation of the Transactions.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this _Section 5.4_, Parent and Merger Sub
shall, in connection with obtaining any Consent of any Governmental Authority
(including the Regulatory Approvals) in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, take any and all steps that may be required by any
such Governmental Authority so as to enable the parties to close the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date), including committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or
otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of
assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying or waiving existing
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements
of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries and (iii)
creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (each a " _Remedial Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , any
Remedial Action may, at the discretion of the Company or Parent, be
conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Parent may take any reasonable action to resist or reduce the scope of a
Remedial Action that has been proposed by any such Governmental Authority so
long as it does not delay the consummation of the Transactions to a date later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this _Section 5.4_, in the event that any
Proceeding by a Governmental Authority is commenced, threatened or is
reasonably foreseeable that seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Transactions, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any
and all action, including a Remedial Action, to avoid or resolve any such
Proceeding as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date). In addition, each
party shall cooperate with each other party and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to contest, defend and resist any such Proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Proceeding or Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, delays, interferes with or restricts consummation of the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to, in connection
with obtaining any Consent of any Governmental Authority (including the
Regulatory Approvals) in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions,
offer or accept, or agree, commit to agree or consent to, any undertaking,
term, condition, liability, obligation, commitment, sanction or other measure
(including any Remedial Action) that constitutes a Burdensome Condition. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Burdensome Condition_ " means any
undertakings, terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments,
sanctions or other measures (including any Remedial Action) that would have or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, assets, liabilities,
businesses or results of operations of (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (ii) Parent and its 

 



34  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and determined after giving effect to the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such undertakings, terms,
conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments, sanctions or other
measures shall not constitute or be taken into account in determining whether
there has been or is such a material adverse effect to the extent such
undertakings, terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments,
sanctions or other measures are expressly set forth in _Section 1.6_. The
Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, in
connection with obtaining any Consent of any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, (x) offer to agree to any
undertaking, term, condition, liability, obligation, commitment, sanction or
other measure (including any Remedial Action) that would reasonably be
expected to be material and adverse to Parents ability to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals on substantially the terms that Parent reasonably
expects, or (y) accept, or agree, commit to agree or consent to, any
undertaking, term, condition, liability, obligation, commitment, sanction or
other measure (including any Remedial Action); _provided_ , _however_ , the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall take any Remedial Action requested by
Parent if such Remedial Action is conditioned upon the consummation of the
Transactions.

5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that it shall, from and after the Effective Time, assume the
obligations under the Companys Change in Control Severance Plan (as in
effect as of the date hereof) for Certain Executives (as amended and in effect
as of the date of this Agreement) and Severance Pay Plan and perform the
obligations under such plan. For a period of one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Parent will maintain the Severance Pay Plan in accordance with
its existing terms and shall provide, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to provide, to each employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time whose employment is not
subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or relationship
(collectively, the " _Company Non-Union Employees_ "), for so long as the
applicable employee remains employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) during such one (1)-year period, a base
salary or base wage rate, an annual cash bonus opportunity, and a long-term
incentive opportunity (including target bonus amounts), in each case, that is
no less than that provided to such Company Non-Union Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time and employee benefits (excluding incentive
compensation) which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than the
employee benefits (excluding incentive compensation), in the aggregate,
provided to such Company Non-Union Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits (other than for vesting purposes under any
equity-based or incentive compensation plan and other than for purposes of
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans)) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) providing benefits to any Company Non-Union Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, credit each Company
Non-Union Employee with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Non-Union Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any corresponding Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company
Non-Union Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits or where prior service with Parent or its Subsidiaries is not
credited for similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries or
with respect to frozen or grand-fathered plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
In addition, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, provide that: (i) each Company Non-Union Employee
shall be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New
Plans that are welfare benefit plans to the extent such New Plan provides
benefits of the same type as an Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company

 



35  Non-Union Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") other than limitations or waiting
periods that would have been in effect with respect to such Company Non-Union
Employee under such Old Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Non-Union Employee, Parent shall cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless such conditions would not have been waived under the corresponding Old
Plan in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by a Company Non-Union Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall fully comply with all notice, consultation, bargaining and other
obligations to any labor union, labor organization or other representative of
employees, including any such obligations that may arise or exist in
connection with the Transactions.

 

(d) To the extent a Company Non-Union Employee or a Company Retired Employee
becomes eligible to participate in Parents or one of its Subsidiarys
retiree medical plan, for all purposes (including purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the retiree medical
plan of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, each (i)
Company Non-Union Employee and (ii) former employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries whose employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
ended as a result of such former employees retirement and who is eligible to
participate in the Companys retiree medical plan as of the Effective Time
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include any such individuals who
waived participation in such retiree medical plan but are still eligible,
pursuant to the terms of such retiree medical plan as in effect on the date
hereof, to participate in such plan) (the " _Company Retired Employees_ "),
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Non-Union Employee or Company Retired Employee
was entitled, immediately before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under the Companys retiree medical plan as of the Effective Time.
For a period of one (1) year immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, provide postretirement medical benefits
to "Eligible Retirees" (as defined below) that are no less favorable than
those provided under the Companys postretirement medical program as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Retiree Health Plan_
"). " _Eligible Retirees_ " means Company Retired Employees who participate
in the Company Retiree Health Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and
Company Non-Union Employees who retire prior to the last day of such one (1)
year period and become eligible to participate in the Company Retiree Health
Plan (or any plan provided in lieu of the Company Retiree Health Plan during
such one (1) year period) prior to the last day of such one (1) year period
and who, in each case, continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements of
the Company Retiree Health Plan (or would continue to satisfy such
requirements if such individual was a participant in such plan).

 

(e) On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent a list,
organized by site of employment, that specifies each employee of the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries who have experienced, or to the Companys knowledge
will experience, an employment loss or layoff as defined by the WARN Act on or
within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall update
this list up to and including the Closing Date.

 



36 (f) From and after the Effective Time, with respect to employees whose
employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement or relationship,
the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary shall comply with all
collective bargaining agreements as may be in effect from time to time, it
being understood that this paragraph shall not be construed as a limitation
on the rights of the parties to such an agreement to amend such agreement in a
manner permitted by applicable Law.

 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall be deemed to create or be treated as
an amendment of any benefit plan or prohibit the termination of any benefit
plan in a manner that is not inconsistent with this _Section 5.5_. The
provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are solely for the benefit of the respective
parties to this Agreement and nothing in this  _Section 5.5_, express or
implied, shall confer upon any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or
legal representative or beneficiary thereof or other Person, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever
under this Agreement or a right in any employee or beneficiary of such
employee or other Person under an Employee Benefit Plan that such employee
or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under the terms of
that Employee Benefit Plan.

5.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current
and former director, officer and employee of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, whenever asserted,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission
relating to their position with the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or
alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective Time (including any
Proceeding relating in whole or in part to this Agreement or the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation to include provisions for limitation of liabilities of
directors and officers, indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the Indemnified Persons no less favorable to the Indemnified
Persons than as set forth in the Companys Organizational Documents in effect
on the date of this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not, for six (6) years after the Effective Time, amend, repeal or otherwise
modify the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of any Indemnified
Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent
required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume and fulfill all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Indemnified Persons in respect of limitation of liability,
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation as provided in the
Companys Organizational Documents and the respective Organizational Documents
of each of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, which shall in each case survive the Transactions and continue in
full force and effect to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause to be obtained, and Parent shall fully
prepay the premiums of, a "tail" insurance policy or policies providing
insurance coverage in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys director and officer liability policies existing as of the date
hereof and disclosed on _Section 5.6(c)_ of the

 



37  Company Disclosure Schedule for matters, acts or omissions arising, existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, with a claims period of at
least six (6) years from the Effective Time, and from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier providing such insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent be required to spend more than 300% (the " _Cap Amount_ ") of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the
amount of such premium being set forth in _Section 5.6(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) for the six (6) years of coverage under such tail
policy, but if the cost of such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, Parent shall
purchase as much coverage as is reasonably obtainable for the Cap Amount.

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, the
parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or
expense advancement pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ and his or her heirs and
representatives.

 

5.7 _Agreement to Defend; Litigation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
notify as promptly as reasonably practicable the other of the commencement of
any shareholder litigation relating to this Agreement or the Transactions of
which it has received notice (" _Transaction Litigation_ "). The Company shall
give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in, but not control, the
defense or settlement of any such Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including _Section
4.1(b)(xiv)_), no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

5.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing, and shall provide each other reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, other public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions (including any statement that constitutes "proxy materials" or
"solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17
under the Exchange Act), and shall not issue any such press release or, to
the extent reasonably practicable, make any other public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process,
or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such partys capital stock is
traded, in which case such party will, to the extent reasonably practicable,
promptly inform the other party in writing in advance of such disclosure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this  _Section
5.8_ shall not apply to any release or public statement (a) relating to an
Adverse Recommendation Change if made in accordance with _Section 5.3_ and
(b) that is not inconsistent in any material respect with the prior public
disclosures regarding the Transactions. The Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to advise Parent in advance of the content of any Current Report on
Form 8-K relating to material developments involving the Company that
the Company intends to file with the SEC.

5.9 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall take such actions as reasonably necessary to cause any

respect to Company Common Stock) pursuant to the Transactions by any officer
or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance
with the procedures set forth in such Rule 16b-3 and the Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999).

 



38 5.10 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. The Company shall not take any action
that would cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by
any Takeover Laws (or Article Seventh of the Company Articles of
Incorporation). If any Takeover Laws become applicable to the Transactions,
the Company and the Company Board shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

 

5.11 _Notifications_. Until the Effective Time, to the extent not in violation
of any applicable Law, (a) each party shall give notice to the other party as
promptly as reasonably practicable of (i) any circumstance, development,
change, event, effect or occurrence of which it has knowledge that has had or
that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, or (ii) any material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to a failure of any condition to the obligations of
the other party to consummate the Merger as set forth in _Article VI_ to be
satisfied and (b) the Company shall provide a copy of any written
"comment letter" received by the Company or the Regulated Utility Subsidiary
after the date of this Agreement from the staff of the SEC regarding any
Company SEC Documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement and (B) in no event shall the failure to comply with this _Section
5.11_ give rise to a failure of any condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be
satisfied.

5.12 _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation_. Parent shall take all actions
necessary to (including taking all actions necessary to cause Intermediate
Parent to) (a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform
promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement and (b)

forth in this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not
engage in any activity of any nature except for activities related to or in
furtherance of the Transactions.

5.13 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective
operations.

5.14 _Financing_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to consummate
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Letters,
on or prior to the Closing Date, including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) (A) maintain in effect the Debt Letters (other than as otherwise
permitted by this _Section 5.14_) and satisfy on a timely basis all of its
obligations thereunder and (B) negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing reflecting the terms contained
in the Debt Letters (or with other terms agreed by Parent and the Financing
Sources, subject to the restrictions on amendments of the Debt Letters set
forth below), and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all the conditions to the
Debt Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto that are
applicable to Parent and are within Parents control (but excluding any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of any of
the Companys failure to furnish information required under _Section 5.15_).

 



39 (b) In the event that all conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and 
_Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can be
satisfied only at the Closing), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Financing Sources to fund on the Closing Date the Debt
Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the
Transactions, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights
under the Debt Letters (including by using reasonable best efforts to take
enforcement action to cause such lenders and the other Financing Sources to
fund such Debt Financing).

 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
Parents efforts to obtain the Debt Financing and to satisfy the conditions
thereof, including advising and updating the Company, in a reasonable level of
detail, with respect to status and proposed closing date of the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall notify the Company as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event, with respect to
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , within one (1) Business Day) if at any time prior
to the Closing Date:

 

(i) any Debt Letter expires or is terminated for any reason (or if any Person
attempts to terminate or repudiate any Debt Letter in writing to Parent,
whether or not such attempted termination or repudiation is valid);

(ii) any Financing Source refuses to provide to Parent or its Subsidiaries
all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters on
the terms set forth therein (or expresses in writing to Parent that such
Person does not intend to enter into the definitive documents related to the
Debt Financing or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby); or

(iii) if at any time Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt
Letters or the definitive documents related to the Debt Financing.

 

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent may not amend, modify,
terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt Letters (other than to
add lenders, arrangers, agents, bookrunners, managers and other financing
sources) which would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the maximum Debt
Financing, (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the Debt Financing or
otherwise expand, amend or waive any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
or (iii) otherwise expand, amend or modify any provision of the Debt Letters,
in each case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions or (B) adversely impact
in any material respect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against
the Financing Sources under the Debt Letters or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto. In the event that new debt commitment letters are
entered into in connection with any amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of the Debt Letters permitted pursuant to this _Section
5.14(d)_, such new commitment letters shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Debt Financing" and deemed to be the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt
Letters.

(e) To the extent that Parent believes in good faith that it will not have
funds available, including cash on hand and the amounts set forth in the Debt
Letters, that are sufficient to enable it to consummate the Transactions,
Parent shall (i) notify the Company in writing thereof as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any case, within one (1) Business Day,
following the occurrence of such event, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain substitute financing, with terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Parent in the aggregate than the terms and conditions set forth

 



40  in the Debt Letters, sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the
Transactions in accordance with its terms (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and
(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment
letter that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after
execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of
the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form
removing only the fee amounts, pricing caps, time periods, the rates and the
economic terms of the "market flex") with respect to such Substitute
Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute
Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the "Debt
Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be
deemed the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(f) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Debt Letters.

(g) Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither
Parents nor Merger Subs obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner
upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Debt Financing or any Substitute
Financing except to the extent limited in _Section 8.11_.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will any failure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with this
_Section 5.14_ be used by the Company as a basis to (x) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ or (y) assert the failure of the
condition set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_ to be satisfied, except in each case
to the extent Parent has acted in bad faith or committed a Willful and
Material Breach with respect to its obligations pursuant to this _Section
5.14_.

 

5.15 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to Closing, upon the reasonable request of Parent, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives who are not officers
or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, in each case, use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with any
Financing, including any offering of securities, requested repayment or
refinancing of Indebtedness, and such reasonable best efforts shall include:
(i) causing management teams of the Company, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, to
participate in meetings, rating agency presentations, due diligence sessions
and road shows, if any; (ii) providing information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to Parent and its Representatives (including the
Financing Sources) as reasonably requested by Parent; (iii) preparing and
furnishing to Parent on a timely basis the Required Information, which shall
be prepared in accordance with applicable securities Laws, and other
financial data (including such information reasonably necessary to allow
Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements in accordance with applicable
securities Laws) and such other financial information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by Parent, including, without
limitation, balance sheet, income statements and statements of cash flows for
each subsequent interim financial quarter ended at least forty-five (45) days

similar documents (" _Offering Documents_ "); (v) (A) using its reasonable
best efforts to cause Deloitte or other relevant accountants of the Company
and its respective Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent, including by
participating in drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions, and
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of, and customary
comfort letters from, such accountants to the extent required in connection
with any offering of securities by Parent if necessary for Parents use of
financial statements of the Company or its Subsidiaries on a timely basis and
(B) cooperating with Parents legal counsel in connection with any legal
opinions that such counsel may be required to deliver in connection with any
Financing; (vi)

 



41  assisting in the amendment or novation of any Derivative Transaction of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case, on terms that are reasonably
requested by Parent; _provided_ that no obligation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries under any such amendments or novations shall be effective until
the Closing Date; (vii) furnishing promptly all documentation and other
information required by any Governmental Authority or as reasonably requested
by any Financing Source under applicable "know your customer," anti-bribery

_et seq._ , and economic sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department to the extent requested at
least seven (7) Business Days prior to Closing; (viii) in connection with any
Financing, executing and delivering any definitive financing documents as
reasonably requested by Parent and delivering such officers certificates
(other than any solvency certificate) as are customary in financings of
such type and as are, in the good faith determination of the persons
executing such officers certificates, accurate; _provided_ that no obligation
of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any such definitive financing
documents, including any pledge and security documents, shall be effective
until the Closing Date; (ix) causing the taking of any corporate, limited
liability company or partnership actions, as applicable, by the Company or its
Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the completion of any Financing;
(x) seeking to obtain customary payoff letters, lien terminations and releases

Indebtedness to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date;
_provided_ that the documents in respect of such arrangements contemplated by
this clause (x) shall not need to be effective until the Closing Date; and
(xi) using reasonable best efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts in
respect of any Financing benefit from the Companys existing lending and
investment banking relationships. If at any time any information in any
Offering Document should be discovered by the Company or any of its
Representatives that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to such
Offering Document, so that such Offering Document shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact, omit to state a material fact that is required
to be stated therein or omit to state a material fact that is necessary to be
stated therein in order for a statement not to be misleading, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent thereof and provide any such information to be
set forth in such amendment or supplement.

 

(b) Nothing in this _Section 5.15_ shall (i) require any such cooperation to
the extent that it would (A) require the Company to pay any commitment or
other fees (unless promptly reimbursed in accordance with _Section 5.15(c)_)
or otherwise incur any liabilities or give any indemnities that would be
effective prior to the Closing (other than such liabilities referred to in
_Section 5.15(c)(i)_ or _Section 5.15(c)(ii))_, (B) unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries,

connection with the activities set forth in _Section 5.15(a)_ shall be paid
or reimbursed by Parent, and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any claim, loss,

expenses of counsel and accountants) or obligation suffered or incurred by
them in connection 

 



42  with any Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than (i) with respect to information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries provided by the Company in writing for use in the Offering
Documents to the extent any such obligation is a result of any such
information containing an untrue statement of a material fact, omitting to
state a material fact that is required to be stated therein or omitting
to state a material fact that is necessary to be stated therein in order for
such information not to be misleading and (ii) to the extent such liability or
obligation arise from gross negligence or bad faith of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or a Willful and Material Breach by the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event

or committed a Willful and Material Breach with respect to its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 5.15_ or (y) assert the failure of the condition

Willful and Material Breach with respect to its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.15_.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, promptly following
Parents request, the Company shall deliver a notice (an " _Existing Loan
Notice_ ") prepared by Parent, which notice shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, to the lenders under the Companys and
its Subsidiaries then existing credit facilities or term loans specified in

such Existing Loan Lenders of this Agreement and the contemplated Merger. At
Parents election, the Existing Loan Notice to certain Existing Loan Lenders
may include a request for a consent, which request shall be in form and

construing the language contained therein. The words "this Agreement,"
"herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar import,
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision
unless expressly so limited. The words "this Article," "this Section," "this

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

 



61  ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY

adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each party agrees that, if for any reason any
party shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
otherwise breached this Agreement, then the party seeking to enforce this
Agreement against such nonperforming party shall be entitled in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other remedy that may be available to it
whether in law or equity including monetary damages (but only to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_), to seek and obtain
in the courts contemplated by  _Section 8.8_ (a) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (b) the issuance of immediate injunctive and other
equitable relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree to waive any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of
any such injunctive or other equitable relief. Each party further agrees not
to assert that any of the foregoing remedies is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to object to such a remedy
on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy for any such breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, it is agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance of Parents obligation to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions if and only if (i) all conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature can
be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable
of being satisfied at such time), (ii) no Financing Failure has occurred or
is occurring and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that
if the Debt Financing is funded, then the Closing pursuant to _Article I_ will
occur. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.11_ are an integral part of the Transactions and
that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this
Agreement.

 



62 8.12 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may
be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by written agreement of the
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) following receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions
hereof which by Law would require further approval by the shareholders of the
Company without such approval, (b) _Section 7.3(j)_, _Section 8.7_, 
_Section 8.8_, _Section 8.11_, _Section 8.15_ and this _Section 8.12_ (and
any provision in this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification,
waiver or termination of such provision would modify the substance of such
Sections) may not be amended or supplemented in a manner that adversely
impacts in any respect the Financing Sources (and solely in the case of
_Section 8.8_ and _Section 8.15_, the Financing Persons) without the prior
written consent of the lead arrangers of the Financing Sources and (c) after
the Effective Time, this Agreement may not be amended or supplemented in any
respect.

 

8.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company
or Parent, as applicable, by action taken or authorized by its board of
directors, may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements
or covenants contained herein or waive any of such partys conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the parties in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party to any
extension, waiver or any consent under this Agreement shall be valid unless
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

8.14 _Transfer Taxes_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 2.3(d)(ii)_ and
_Section 2.3(i)_, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
when due and shall not be a liability of holders of Company Common Stock
other than such Taxes and fees actually assessed by a Governmental Authority
against any holders of Company Common Stock.

 

8.15 _Lenders_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, except for claims by Parent pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter
and any definitive documentation related thereto, no Financing Person shall
have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or shareholders for any
obligations or liabilities of any party under this Agreement or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or Debt
Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
