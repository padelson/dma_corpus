thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund; No_ _Liability_. At any time following twelve months
after the Effective Time, the Buyer will be entitled to require the Paying
Agent to deliver to it any funds (including, without limitation, any earnings
received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying
Agent and that have not been disbursed to the Company Holders and thereafter
such holders will be entitled to look only to the Buyer (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements) and only as general
creditors thereof with respect to such holders applicable payment, upon and
subject to delivery of the duly executed applicable Letter of Transmittal, as
applicable, and, with respect to any Company Holder, upon due surrender of
their certificates formerly representing such interests, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable to any Company Holder for any
amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate(s)
has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory
to the Buyer and the Paying Agent, the Buyer or Paying Agent will pay such
holder the payment to which such holder is entitled, as provided in this
_Article 2_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer may, in its sole
discretion and as a condition precedent to issuing such payment, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate(s) to deliver an

 



29

    

 agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer
and a bond in such sum as the Buyer may reasonably direct as indemnity, not to
exceed the amount of the Company Holders Merger Consideration, against any
claim that may be made against the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(f) _Company Options and Company RSU Awards_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof), the Company shall distribute to each
Company Award Holder an Equity Award Cancellation Agreement in substantially
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (an " _Equity Award Cancellation
Agreement_ "). Subject to Buyers receipt of a duly-executed Equity Award
Cancellation Agreement from the applicable Company Award Holder, the Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) pay each such Company
Award Holder, as promptly as practicable through its payroll (and in any event
no later than the next payroll period of the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing Date), such Company Award Holders share of the
cash portion of the Closing Merger Consideration in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule, and (ii) cause the Buyers transfer agent to deliver a
statement reflecting such Company Award Holders shares of Buyer Common Stock,
if any, in book entry, which amounts shall be paid less any applicable tax
withholding required by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, all
applicable Tax withholding for the Per Share Closing Consideration payable to
a Company Award Holder (including any portion paid in the form of Buyer
Common Stock, if any) shall be deducted from the portion of such Per Share
Closing Consideration payable in cash to such Company Award Holder. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain executed Equity Award
Cancellation Agreements from all Company Award Holders prior to the Closing
Date.

(g) _Optionholder Notes_. Each holder of Company Options as of the date of
this Agreement who elects to exercise his or her Company Options prior the
Effective Time may elect to execute a promissory note in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Optionholder Note_ ") for the purpose of paying
the applicable exercise price and any applicable withholding Taxes payable by
such holder with respect to the exercise of such Company Options (each holder
who so elects is referred to herein as an " _Electing Optionholder_ "). The
amount of each Optionholder Note shall be referenced as the " _Note
Obligation_ " and reflected on the Allocation Spreadsheet opposite the name of
each Electing Optionholder. The Note Obligations, plus any interest due at
the time of repayment of the Optionholder Notes, shall be repaid by each
Electing Optionholder automatically by offsetting the Note Obligation against
the portion of the Closing Consideration to be paid in cash to such Electing
Optionholder.

Section 2.9 _Shareholders_ __ _Representative_.

 

(a) By voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger or by surrendering or
delivering to the Paying Agent or the Company (or its designee payroll
service provider), as applicable, an executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Paying Agent, in exchange for the consideration to be paid in accordance with
this Agreement, each Company Holder irrevocably approves the depositing
of the funds held in the Shareholders Representative Fund and the
constitution and appointment of, and hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the sole, exclusive, true
and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact of all Company Holders
and each of them (the " _Shareholders_ __ _Representative_ ") with respect to
any and all matters relating

 



30

    

 to, arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement or any agreements ancillary hereto, including for purposes of taking
any action or omitting to take any action on behalf of each Company Holder
hereunder to:

(i) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents that the Shareholders Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement, or
in connection with any of the matters set forth in clauses (ii) through (xi)
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(a)_;

 

(ii) following the Closing, amend any terms of this Agreement related to the
Development Milestone Events and the associated payment amounts and timing
thereof, Buyers obligation to develop and seek Marketing Approval of MT1621
and the Development Milestone Review Committees rights to information related
to the Development Milestone Events;

 

(iii) receive funds, make payments of funds and give receipts for funds;

 

(iv) do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the Company
Holders that the Shareholders Representative deems necessary or appropriate
in its discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully
and completely as the Company Holders could do if personally present;

 

(v) administer the defense or settlement of any disputes regarding the Closing
Cash Payment adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ and agreeing to or
negotiating the Final Closing Statement and Final Closing Cash Payment;

 

(vi) administer the defense or settlement of any disputes regarding any
Contingent Payments pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.13_;

(vii) contest any claims for indemnification pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.1_, to deliver any Claim Dispute Notice pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4_,
and to administer the defense or settlement of any such claims for
indemnification, and of any disputes with respect thereto;

(viii) give any written direction to the Paying Agent;

 

(ix) give or receive notices to be given or received by the Company Holders
under this Agreement, or the Paying Agent Agreement (except to the extent
that this Agreement, or the Paying Agent Agreement expressly contemplates that
any such notice shall be given or received by each Company Holder
individually);

 

(x) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement; and

(xi) take any other action that, pursuant to the express terms hereof, is to
be (or which may be taken by) the Shareholders Representative.

 



31

    

All actions, notices, communications and determinations by or on behalf
of the Company Holders shall be given or made by the Shareholders
Representative and all such actions, notices, communications and
determinations by the Shareholders Representative shall conclusively be
deemed to have been authorized by, and shall be binding upon, any of and all
Company Holders, and no Company Holder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Without limiting the rights
and obligations of the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub under this Agreement,
the Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the
Estimated Closing Statement, Allocation Schedule, the Transaction Expense
Schedule, and the CoC Payment Schedule _,_ (ii) rely upon any signature
believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has
proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company Holder.

 

(b) The Shareholders Representative may resign at any time. If the
Shareholders Representative resigns, dies or becomes legally incapacitated,
then a majority of the Company Holders, based on their respective Pro Rata
Percentages, shall promptly designate in writing to Buyer a single Person to
fill the Shareholders Representative vacancy as the successor Shareholders
Representative hereunder. If at any time there shall not be a Shareholders
Representative or the Company Holders fail to designate a successor
Shareholders Representative, then Buyer may have a court of competent
jurisdiction appoint a Shareholders Representative hereunder. A majority of
the Company Holders, based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages, may also
replace the Person serving as the Shareholders Representative from time to
time and for any reason upon at least ten (10) days prior written notice to
Buyer.

(c) The Shareholders Representative shall act for the Company Holders on all
of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Shareholders
Representative reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Holders. The Shareholders Representative is authorized to act on behalf of
the Company Holders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the
Company Holders. In taking any actions as Shareholders Representative, the
Shareholders Representative may rely conclusively, without any further
inquiry or investigation, upon any certification or confirmation, oral or
written, given by any Person the Shareholders Representative reasonably
believes to be authorized thereunto. The Shareholders Representative
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
into this Agreement against the Shareholders Representative. The
Shareholders Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect
to any action or omission by the Shareholders Representative in connection
with the Shareholders Representatives services pursuant to this Agreement
and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Shareholders Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Shareholders Representative shall not be liable for any
action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Company Holders will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholders Representative from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_
") arising out of or in connection with the Shareholders Representatives
execution and performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or
incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the

 



32

    

 Shareholders Representative, the Shareholders Representative will
reimburse the Company Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative
Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Shareholders Representative by the
Company Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Shareholders Representative from (i) the funds in the Shareholders
Representative Fund and (ii) the Escrow Fund, any Development Milestone
Payment or any Royalty Payment, in each case only at or after such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company
Holders; provided, that while this section allows the Shareholders
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Company Holders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Shareholders Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Shareholders Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Company Holders or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or
provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to,
the Company Holders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to
be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Shareholders Representative
under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Shareholders Representative or the termination
of this Agreement. Except for this Agreement and the Shareholders
Representative engagement letter, the Shareholders Representative has not
entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding with the Company or
any Company Holder, and the Company Holders do not have any requirements,
prerequisites or veto rights in connection with the Shareholders
Representatives fulfillment of its obligations or exercise of its rights
under this Agreement other than as set forth in such engagement letter.

 

(d) The Shareholders Representative shall treat confidentially any nonpublic
information disclosed to it pursuant to this Agreement and shall not use such
nonpublic information other than in the performance of its duties as the
Shareholders Representative. In addition, the Shareholders Representative
shall not disclose any nonpublic information disclosed to it pursuant to this
Agreement to anyone except as required by Law; _provided_ that (i) the
Shareholders Representative may disclose such nonpublic information to legal
counsel and other advisors under an obligation of confidentiality and non-use
in its capacity as such (for the purpose of advising the Company Holders on
any information disclosed to such Shareholders Representative pursuant to
this Agreement), (ii) the Shareholders Representative (or legal counsel or
other advisor to whom information is disclosed pursuant to clause (i) above)
may disclose such nonpublic information disclosed to the Shareholders
Representative pursuant to this Agreement in any Action relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in either case,
discussion in preparation therefor) and (iii) the Shareholders Representative
may disclose to employees, advisors, agents or consultants of the
Shareholders Representative and to any Company Holder (in each case who have
a need to know such information and who are subject to confidentiality
obligations with respect thereto) any such nonpublic information disclosed to
the Shareholders Representative.

(e) Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the authority of the
Shareholders Representative as the agent, representative and attorney-in-
fact of the Company Holders for all purposes under this Agreement and shall
have no Liability for any such reliance. No Company Holder may revoke the
authority of the Shareholders Representative. Each Company Holder, by voting
in favor of

 



33

    

 or consenting to the Merger or by surrendering or delivering a Certificate
or an affidavit in lieu thereof to the Paying Agent or the Company (or its
designee payroll service provider), as applicable, along with an executed
Letter of Transmittal hereby ratifies and confirms, and hereby agrees to
ratify and confirm, any action taken by the Shareholders Representative in
the exercise of the power-of-attorney granted to the Shareholders
Representative pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, which power-of-
attorney, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable and shall survive the
death, incapacity or incompetence of such Company Holder.

 

(f) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Shareholders Representative Fund
Amount to the Shareholders Representative, which shall be maintained by the
Shareholders Representative in a segregated account (the aggregate amount of
cash so held by the Shareholders Representative from time to time, the "
_Shareholders_ __ _Representative Fund_ "). The Shareholders Representative
will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these
funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. The Company Holders shall not receive interest or other earnings
on the Shareholders Representative Fund and the Company Holders irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Shareholders Representative any ownership right
that they may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in the
Shareholders Representative Fund. The Company Holders acknowledge that the
Shareholders Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice. The Shareholders Representative shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Shareholders
Representative Fund other than as a result of its bad faith, gross negligence
or willful misconduct. For Tax purposes, the Shareholders Representative Fund
shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.1(f)_. The Shareholders
Representative shall be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in the performance of its duties (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) under this Agreement from the
Shareholders Representative Fund; _provided_ that if the Shareholders
Representative Fund is insufficient to pay such expenses, then the
Shareholders Representative shall be reimbursed directly from the Company
Holders on a several basis (and not a joint and several basis) according to
their respective Pro Rata Percentages.

(g) Upon the determination of the Shareholders Representative that the
Shareholders Representative Fund is to be distributed to the Company Holders,
(i) the Shareholders Representative shall calculate the amount to be
distributed to the Company Holders after (A) payment of all of the
Shareholders Representatives out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with its services as Shareholders Representative and (B) deduction of the
Employer Tax Amount payable on or triggered by such payment of the portion of
such amount to be paid to the Company Award Holders by the Surviving
Corporation with the amount in clause (B) to be calculated iteratively, (ii)
deposit with the Paying Agent such portion of the resulting amount payable to
the Company Holders other than the Company Award Holders, and (iii) pay to the
Surviving Corporation such portion of the resulting amount payable to the
Company Award Holders plus the Employer Tax Amount calculated in clause (i)(B)
above. The Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
make payments to the Company Holders pursuant to the Allocation Schedule,
less any applicable Tax withholding required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , than such amounts payable to the Company Award Holders shall in no
event be paid more than five years following the Closing Date. Any portion of
the Shareholders Representative Fund that remains undeliverable or unclaimed
after twelve (12) months of the initial delivery attempt (or such earlier
date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts 

 



34

    

 would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity by
Law) shall become, to the extent permitted by Law, including any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law, the property of Buyer, free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. The
Shareholders Representative Fund shall not be available to Buyer to satisfy
any claims in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 2.10 _Close of Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital
Stock on the records of the Company unless and until reopened by the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, no shares of Company Capital
Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding, and the holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable Law.

Section 2.11 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who (i) voted against the Merger (if submitted for approval
at a meeting of shareholders); (ii) did not consent in writing to the Merger
(if submitted for approval by written consent in lieu of a meeting); or (iii)
has not otherwise contractually waived its rights of dissent and appraisal,
and, in each case, who has exercised and perfected its rights of dissent and
appraisal for such shares in accordance with the Dissent Statute and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such rights of dissent and appraisal
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and the holder or holders of such Dissenting Shares, but
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to the Dissent Statute. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who,
pursuant to the Dissent Statute, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for
such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the Dissent
Statute (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to such provisions).

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.11(a)_, if any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders rights to dissent and appraisal under the
Dissent Statute, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to relief provided under the Dissent Statute,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holders shares of Company Capital Stock shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the consideration for
Company Capital Stock set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, without interest,
following surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Company
Capital Stock in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ or, in the case
of a lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed certificate, upon delivery
of the documents, if required, described in _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

(c) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall give
the Shareholders Representative prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, negotiations between the Surviving Corporation and any holders of
Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related
instruments served on or by the Surviving Corporation.

 



35

    

Section 2.12 _Closing Cash Payment Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. No later than four (4) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare in good faith and provide to
Buyer a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its good faith estimate
of the estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the estimated Closing
Indebtedness Amount, the estimated Closing Cash Amount, the estimated Seller
Transaction Expenses and the estimated Change of Control Payments (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ "). The Estimated Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

 

(b) _Estimated Closing Cash Payment_. The amount of the Closing Cash Payment
shall be calculated using the estimated Closing Net Working Capital,
estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount, the estimated Closing Cash Amount, the
estimated Seller Transaction Expenses and the estimated Change of Control
Payments set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, which shall be subject
to a "true-up" adjustment after the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.12(f)_.

 

(c) _Proposed Final Closing Statement_. Not later than ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and deliver to
the Shareholders Representative, a statement setting forth in reasonable
detail its proposed final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the Seller Transaction
Expenses and the Change of Control Payments (the " _Proposed Final Closing
Statement_ "). The Proposed Final Closing Statement will be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and in accordance with the
definitions in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any calculations with respect to Taxes in the Estimated
Closing Statement and the Proposed Final Closing Statement shall be calculated
as of the end of the day on the Closing Date taking into account the effect
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Shareholders
Representative and its Representatives shall have reasonable access to the
books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents), supporting data, facilities and employees of the Surviving
Corporation for purposes of assisting the Shareholders Representative and its
Representatives in their review of the Proposed Final Closing Statement and
the Buyer shall cooperate with the Shareholders Representative and its
Representatives in good faith in connection with such review; _provided_ ,
that such access shall be limited to normal business hours.

 

(d) _Dispute Notice_. The Proposed Final Closing Statement will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties unless the Shareholders Representative
provides a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer no later than the
twentieth (20th) Business Day after the delivery to the Shareholders
Representative of the Proposed Final Closing Statement. Any Dispute Notice
must set forth, based upon the information available to the Shareholders
Representative, in reasonable detail the Shareholders Representatives
alternative calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses
and the Change of Control Payments, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt,
any item not included in the Dispute Notice shall be considered final and
binding.

(e) _Resolution of Disputes_. Buyer and Shareholders Representative will
attempt to promptly resolve the matters raised in any Dispute Notice in good
faith. If the Parties have not resolved the matters raised in any Dispute
Notice, within ten (10) Business Days after the date of

 



36

    

 delivery of any Dispute Notice pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12(d)_ either
Buyer or Shareholders Representative may provide written notice to the other
(the " _Dispute Submission Notice_ ") that it elects to submit the disputed
items to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen jointly by
Buyer and the Shareholders Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In
the event that an Accounting Firm has not been selected by mutual agreement of
Buyer and the Shareholders Representative within ten (10) Business Days
following the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice, each of Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative shall promptly select an accounting firm and
promptly cause such two accounting firms to mutually select a third
independent accounting firm to act as the Accounting Firm within twenty (20)
Business Days of the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice. The Accounting
Firm will promptly, in accordance with the rules set forth in the Accounting
Firms engagement letter and its customary practices review only
those unresolved items and amounts specifically set forth and objected to in
the Dispute Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to each such specific
unresolved item and amount in accordance with this Agreement. In any such
case, a single partner of the Accounting Firm selected by such Accounting
Firm in accordance with its normal procedures and having expertise with
respect to settlement of such disputes and the industry in which the Surviving
Corporation operates shall act for the Accounting Firm in the determination
proceeding, and the Accounting Firm shall render a written decision as to each
disputed matter, including a statement in reasonable detail of the basis for
its decision. In no event shall the decision of the Accounting Firm provide
for a calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness
Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses or the Change
of Control Payments that is less than or greater than the calculation thereof
shown in the Proposed Final Closing Statement or less than or greater than
the Shareholders Representatives alternative calculation thereof shown in
the Dispute Notice. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
borne equally by Buyer and the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the
Company Holders). The decision of the Accounting Firm with respect to the
disputed items of the Proposed Final Closing Statement submitted to it will be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. As used herein, the Proposed
Final Closing Statement, as adjusted to reflect any changes agreed to by the
Parties and the decision of the Accounting Firm, in each case, pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.12(e)_, is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing
Statement_ ". Each of the Parties to agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Accounting Firm (including by executing a
customary engagement letter reasonably acceptable to it) and to cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable after the
commencement of the Accounting Firms engagement.

 

(f) _Closing Cash Payment Adjustment_. If any of the Closing Net Working
Capital, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the Seller
Transaction Expenses or the Change of Control Payments (as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ and as set forth in the Final Closing
Statement) differs from the estimated amount thereof set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement, the following shall occur:

(i) the Closing Cash Payment shall be recalculated using the Closing Net
Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the
Seller Transaction Expenses or the Change of Control Payments, as applicable,
in the Final Closing Statement in lieu of the Closing Net Working Capital,
the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Closing Cash Amount or the Seller
Transaction Expenses, as applicable, in the Estimated Closing Statement (such
recalculated Closing Cash Payment, the " _Final Closing Cash Payment_ ");

 



37

    

(ii) if the Final Closing Cash Payment exceeds the Closing Cash Payment paid
at Closing, Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days, (A) calculate the
amount of such excess to be paid to the Company Holders, after deduction of
the Employer Tax Amount payable on or triggered by the payment of the portion
of such amount to be paid to the Company Award Holders by the Surviving
Corporation, with the amount in this clause (A) to be calculated iteratively,
(B) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Paying Agent by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, a portion of the resulting excess amount for
further disbursement to the Company Holders other than the Company Award
Holders, and (C) deliver to the Surviving Corporation the balance of such
resulting excess amount for further disbursement to the Company Award
Holders, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above, each _pro rata_ in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages as a portion of the
Merger Consideration payable to the Company Holders pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.7(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_, as applicable. The Shareholders
Representative shall calculate the amount to be distributed to each Company
Holder according to each Company Holders respective Pro Rata Percentage and
the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall disburse
such amounts to the Company Holders, less applicable Tax withholding; or

 

(iii) if the Final Closing Cash Payment is less than the Closing Cash Payment
paid at Closing (such shortfall, the " _Overpayment Amount_ "), the
Shareholders Representative and Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days,
instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund the lesser of (x)
the Overpayment Amount and (y) the then-existing balance of the Escrow Fund
to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the account
designated by Buyer, such Overpayment Amount; _provided_ that payment from the
Escrow Fund shall be the Buyers sole and exclusive remedy for the payment of
the Overpayment Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no claim by Buyer for the payment of the
Overpayment Amount shall be asserted directly against any of the Company
Holders.

Section 2.13 _Contingent Payments_.

 

(a) _Development Milestones_. Subject to the Right of Setoff, Buyer shall make
the payments described in Table 1 below (each, a " _Development Milestone
Payment_ ") following the first achievement or occurrence by or on behalf of
the Buyer, a Rights Transferee or their respective Affiliates, of the
corresponding event with respect to MT1621 or a MT1621 Backup (each a "
_Development Milestone Event_ ") described in the row to the left of such
payment in Table 1\. In no event shall more than one Development Milestone
Payment be due for either of the two Development Milestone Events in Table
1\.

For clarity, if the two components of MT1621 are individually approved or if
the applicable MT1621 Backup contains two components that are individually
approved (i.e., any combination set forth in sub-clause (2) of the definition
of MT1621 Backup) then the Development Milestone Events set forth in Table
1 above shall be deemed achieved upon obtaining Marketing Approval for both
components in the applicable territory.

 

(i) From and after the Closing Date, not more than once during any six month
period, Buyer shall schedule a meeting between the Development Milestone
Review Committee and a senior representative of the Buyer, (a " _Buyer
Representative_ ") having knowledge of, and actively involved in managing,
Buyers efforts to achieve the Development Milestone Events, by telephone

Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
Agreement against the members of the Development Milestone Review Committee.

of the portion of such amount to be paid to the Company Award Holders) and
the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall disburse
such amounts to the Company Holders, less applicable Tax withholding.

upon the occurrence of any Product Sale or Business Sale during the Earnout
Period, Buyer shall cause the acquiring Third Party to assume the obligations
of Buyer (and Buyer shall remain responsible for such Third Partys
performance absent a novation; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the

Shareholders Representatives consent, such consent not to be unreasonably

(v) The Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) will
bear the full cost of such audit, unless such audit discloses that they

but subject to subsection (vi) below, the Buyer shall bear the reasonable
cost of the Accounting Firm for such audit.

Buyer regarding the findings of an audit under this _Section_ __ _ 2.14(a)_,
the Parties will initially attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute

dispute within thirty (30) days after delivery to both Parties of the
Accounting Firms report, Buyer will select, subject to the Shareholders

 



42

conditioned or delayed, an internationally recognized independent certified

dispute in accordance with such procedures as such independent accounting firm
may determine, and such accounting firms determination will be binding on
both Parties absent manifest error by such accounting firm.

use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to commercialize, promote and sell MT1621
in the United States and Major European Market Countries after Marketing
Approval (including where required or reasonably prudent to obtain, pricing
and reimbursement approvals) has been obtained in the applicable country.
Buyer further agrees that it, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates
will not take any action in bad faith that would reasonably be expected to

doubt, any Development Milestone Payment or Royalty Payments made to any
permitted transferee pursuant

 



43

    

 to this _Section_ __ _ 2.14_ shall be delivered to the Paying Agent or
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for further disbursement to such

methodology will be employed for the translation of foreign currency sales
into Dollars, provided that such methodology is used by Buyer in the
translation of its foreign currency operating results, is consistent with
GAAP, and is audited by Buyers independent certified public accountants
in connection with the audit of the consolidated financial statements of
Buyer, and is used for Buyers external reporting of foreign currency
operating results.

 

Section 2.15 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and any
other applicable withholding agent (each, a " _Withholding Person_ "), will be

contemplated by this Agreement to any Company Holders, recipients of Change of
Control Payments, the Shareholders Representative on the Company Holders
behalf, payments to participants in the Royalty Payment Bonus Plan, or any
other Person, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom under applicable Tax Law and shall pay such amounts to the
appropriate Taxing Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, all compensatory amounts subject to payroll reporting and
withholding payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be
payable through the payroll process of the Surviving Corporation (or any third
party payroll agent of the Surviving Corporation or Affiliate of the
Surviving Corporation designated by Buyer) in accordance with applicable
payroll procedures. Prior to withholding any amounts from a payment made
hereunder other than by reason of withholding on compensatory amounts, Buyer
(or the other applicable withholding agent) shall give the Person(s) concerned
reasonable notice of the proposed withholding and the reasons therefor and
provide such Person with a reasonable opportunity to provide
any documentation to Buyer or the other applicable withholding agent in order
to reduce or eliminate such withholding. To the extent amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, the withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.16 _Accredited/Unaccredited Investors_.

 

(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver
an investor questionnaire in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ H_

include questions and representations relating to the potential issuance of
Buyer Common Stock under this Agreement to such Company Holder under
Regulation D and Regulation S under the Securities Act, including regarding
such Company Holders status as an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule
501 under the Securities Act (" _Accredited Investors_ ").

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, any Company Holder who fails to return a
properly completed Investor Questionnaire within two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date or

 



44

    

 otherwise fails to demonstrate, to Buyers reasonable satisfaction, its, his
or her status as an Accredited Investor, may be deemed by Parent, in its sole
discretion, to not be an Accredited Investor.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no shares of
Buyer Common Stock shall be payable to Company Holders that are not
Accredited Investors in connection with payment of the Merger Consideration,
and each such Company Holder shall instead receive (if, when and to the extent
applicable) an additional cash payment equal to the number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock such Company Holder was otherwise entitled to multiplied by the
Buyer Stock Price in lieu thereof, which payment shall not reduce the amount
of cash payable to, or increase the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock issuable to, the Company Holder that are Accredited Investors. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any adjustment pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.16(c)_ increase the Contingent Payments.

 

Section 2.17 _Legend_. All certificates representing any shares of Buyer
Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall have a
restrictive legend in the following form:

ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT AND QUALIFICATION UNDER THE STATE ACTS OR EXEMPTIONS FROM SUCH
REGISTRATION OR QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF THE
SECURITIES ACT, THE EXEMPTION AFFORDED BY RULE 144 THEREUNDER).

to be treated as a taxable sale of shares of the Company by the Company
Holders, it being understood and agreed that neither Buyer nor Merger Sub nor
any of their Affiliates, representatives or agents, make any representations
or warranties to the Company or to any Company Holder regarding the Tax
treatment of the Merger, or any of the Tax consequences to the Company or any
Company Holder of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions or
the other agreements contemplated by this Agreement. The Company acknowledges
that the Company and the Company Holders are relying solely on their own Tax

421(b) of the Code)as a result of the Merger, and it is intended that the
amount realized as a result of such "disqualifying disposition" attributable
to such a disqualifying disposition for Tax purposes will be equal to the
fair market value of such Company Capital Stock at the time of such
"disqualifying disposition," which amount shall be reported on Form W-2 for
the year in which such amounts are paid to the Company

 



45

    

 Holder pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that no amount with
respect to the Escrow Amount or any Contingent Payments will be reported on a

Surviving Corporation and the applicable Company Holder shall file all Tax
Returns consistently with the foregoing Tax treatment, except as otherwise
expressly required by a Taxing authority. Neither Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, nor any of their Affiliates, agents or representatives shall have
any liability to the Company, any Company Holder or any of their Affiliates
as a result of any Taxing authority taking a contrary position.

Awards or any Contingent Payment is actually paid to Company Award Holders in

local law, as appropriate (provided, however, Buyer is making
no representation or covenant as to whether such Tax treatment shall be
respected by any Governmental Entity); (iii) it is intended that Buyer shall

Period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date will be: (i) in the case of
Property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle

other party of any Tax Matter shall not relieve such other party of any
liability with respect to such Tax Matters except to the extent such party was
actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

 

(ii) Buyer shall have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Matters,
including any settlement or compromise thereof, provided, however, that Buyer

directors, employees, advisors and other Representatives not to, issue a

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor
and fulfill all of the Employee Plans in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the date hereof of or as subsequently amended if
and as permitted pursuant to the term of such Employee Plans. During the
twelve (12) month period immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for each
employee of the Company who continues as an employee of Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates during such period
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), with (i) a base salary or
wage rate no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) target
annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the target
annual cash bonus opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) other employee 

 



71

    

 benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
employee benefits provided to (A) such Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time for so long as the Surviving Corporation
continues to maintain the Employee Plans and (B) following the transfer of
such Continuing Employees to the Buyer Plans, employees of Buyer who are
similarly-situated to such Continuing Employee.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) pay to the Continuing
Employees their target bonus pursuant to the Companys annual bonus plan prior
to March 15, 2020 (subject to the continued employment of such employee
through December 31, 2019 or the earlier termination of such employee by
Buyer without "cause" or by such employee for "good reason" (each as defined
in the Companys Change of Control Severance Plan)), multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed between January 1, 2019
and the Closing and the denominator is 365, and (ii) include each Continuing
Employee in the applicable annual bonus plan of Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation for the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs, on a basis
consistent with similarly-situated employees of Buyer, with such participation
commencing as of the day after the Closing (so that each Continuing Employee
shall be eligible for the full amount of such an annual bonus, pro-rated for
the portion of the year following the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt,
clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence shall not require Buyer to,
or to cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide any Continuing Employee who
participates in the Companys Change of Control Plan with a duplicate payment
of his or her pro-rated target bonus in respect of the Companys annual bonus
plan for fiscal year 2019 in the event such Continuing Employees employment
is terminated by Buyer without "cause" or by such employee for "good reason"
prior to December 31, 2019.

 

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates to (i) give full credit to each Continuing Employee for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and the calculation of benefit accruals
(including for purposes of vacation accruals) under any employee benefit plans
or arrangements maintained by Buyer, its Affiliates, or the Surviving
Corporation (collectively, the " _Buyer Plans_ ") for such Continuing
Employees service with, or credited by, the Company to the same extent
recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than with respect to any severance plan or equity arrangement or defined
contribution plan); (ii) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions, waiting periods, actively at work requirements and evidence of
insurability with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each Continuing Employees under any Buyer Plan that is a welfare
benefit plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Closing Date and (iii) provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the
coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such service shall be recognized or credit given to the
extent such recognition or credit would result in the duplication of benefits.

 

(d) If requested by Buyer, effective no later than the day immediately prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
terminate any and all Employee Plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or
deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code.

 



72

    

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_
or this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an amendment of any
particular Employee Plan, or otherwise, or alter or limit the ability of the
Company, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any compensation or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. No Continuing Employee (or current or former employee of

for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the
right to enforce the provisions hereof.

satisfactory to Buyer (i) that a Company Stockholder vote was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G, and the requisite Company Stockholder approval
was obtained with respect to any payments or benefits that were subject to the
Company Stockholder vote (the " _Section_ __ _ 280G Approval_") or (ii) that
the Section 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, pursuant to
the Section 280G Waiver, such "parachute payments" will not be made, provided
or retained. The 280G Soliciting Materials (including any amendments or
supplements described in _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_) shall be subject to advance

been consummated on or before October 31, 2019 (the " _Expiration Date_ "),
except that no Party will be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

the Shareholders Representative contained in this Agreement was inaccurate
or was breached as of the Agreement Date, or has become inaccurate or has been

result of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the expiration of the Company
Cure Period, _provided_ the Company, during the Company Cure Period, continues
to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach
(it being understood that Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_ if Buyer is in material breach of this Agreement

that the condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ would not be
satisfied on or before the Expiration Date or (ii) if any of Buyers or Merger
Subs covenants contained in this Agreement have been breached such that the
condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ would not be satisfied on or
before the Expiration Date; _provided, however_ , that if an inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub as of a date
subsequent to the Agreement Date or a breach of a covenant by Buyer or Merger
Sub is curable by the same through the use of commercially reasonable efforts

material breach of this Agreement or if such breach by the Buyer or Merger Sub

limitations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ below, from and after the
Effective Time, each Company Holder will severally (in accordance with each

hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
Damages incurred by such Person (such Damages, " _Indemnifiable Damages_ ")
resulting from:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement or in any other certificate executed in connection with this
Agreement by the Company as of the Closing;

(b) any breach or failure to perform on or prior to the Closing any covenant

(e) the VAT Reclaim Amount to the extent Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
(after having used commercially reasonable efforts to receive such payment)
shall not have received a payment of the VAT Reclaim Amount from the

(f) any Taxes of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; Taxes
for which the Company (or any predecessor of the Company) is held liable
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law) by reason of such entity being included in any
consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group at any time on or before
the Closing Date; and Taxes imposed on or payable by third parties with
respect to which the Company has an obligation to indemnify such third
party pursuant to a transaction consummated on or prior to the Closing.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification of_ _Company Holders_. From and after the
Effective Time, Buyer and Merger Sub hereby agree to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, jointly and severally, each Company Holder against and in
respect of, and pay the Company Holder the amount of, any and all Damages
that are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Company
Holders or to which any of the Company Holders may otherwise become directly
or indirectly subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any Third-Party Claim), and that arise from or as a result of, or are
directly or indirectly connected with any of the following:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or Merger Sub
in this Agreement or in any other certificate executed in connection with
this Agreement by the Buyer or Merger Sub as of the Closing; or

 



83

    

(b) any breach or failure to perform on or prior to the Closing any
covenant or agreement herein by Buyer or Merger Sub that is required to be
performed on or prior to the Closing.

Section 8.3  _Limitations on Recovery_. Recovery by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the following
limitations:

 

(a) _Threshold to Recovery of Damages_.

 

(i) No Buyer Indemnified Party may recover Indemnifiable Damages from the
Escrow Fund or the Company Holders in respect of any indemnification pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_ (except with regard to a breach of a Fundamental
Representation, an Extended IP Representation or claims arising as a result of
fraud, which shall not be so limited or subject to any Deductible) until the
aggregate amount (without duplication) of Indemnifiable Damages to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties has exceeded $1,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which
event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the other limitations
contained herein, be entitled to be indemnified for all Indemnifiable Damages
that exceed the Deductible.

 

(b) _Caps on Recovery of Indemnifiable Damages_.

 

(i) Each Company Holders liability for the payment of Indemnifiable Damages
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall be several (in accordance with each
Company Holders Pro Rata Percentage) and not joint.

 

(ii) With regard to indemnification for Indemnifiable Damages under _Section_
__ _ 8.1(a)_ (except with regard to a breach of a Fundamental
Representation, Extended IP Representation, Tax Representation or claims
arising as a result of fraud, which shall not be so limited), amounts retained
in the Escrow Fund will serve as the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole source
of recovery from the Company Holders, and with regard to indemnification for
Indemnifiable Damages under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_ with regard to a breach of
an Extended IP Representation, amounts retained in the Escrow Fund and the
Right of Setoff will serve as the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole source of
recovery from the Company Holders.

 

(iii) Until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, with regard to
indemnification claims made by a Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section_ __ _
8.1(a)_ relating to or arising out of a breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations or under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)-(f)_, a Buyer Indemnified
Party shall recover any Indemnifiable Damages to which it is entitled
hereunder first (A) from the Escrow Fund and (B) solely to the extent amounts
available in the Escrow Fund are insufficient to recover such Indemnifiable
Damages, directly from each Company Holder, severally and not jointly,
according to each such Company Holders Pro Rata Percentage of such
Indemnifiable Damages, up to the aggregate amount actually received by such
Company Holder pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
8.1(a)_ relating to or arising out of a breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations, the Extended IP Representations, the Tax Representations,
under _Section_

 



84

    

  _8.1(b)-(f)_ or as a result of fraud in excess of the amounts then
remaining in the Escrow Fund (or in the event that the Escrow Fund has already
been exhausted or terminated), and Buyer has delivered a Claim Certificate
(as defined in _Section_ __ _ 8.4_) with respect thereto, Buyer shall have
the right but not the obligation to setoff, on a dollar for dollar basis, the
amount of Indemnifiable Damages (in the case of the Fundamental
Representations and the Tax Representations, or under _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)-(f)_ or as a result of fraud) or [***] the amount of Indemnifiable
Damages (in the case of the Extended IP Representations)
reasonably determined by the Buyer Indemnified Party as necessary to satisfy
then pending claims brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such
indemnification rights arising from such claim against Contingent Payments
payable (but not any Contingent Payments previously paid) to the Company
Holders (the " _Right of Setoff_ "). Once such claim is finally determined in
accordance with this Agreement, if the Indemnifiable Damages relating to such
claim are determined to be less than the amount setoff against the applicable
Contingent Payment, or if the Buyer Indemnified Party is determined not to be
entitled to indemnification with respect to such claim, Buyer shall promptly,
and in any event within five (5) Business Days, deliver (i) to the Surviving
Corporation for further distribution by the Surviving Corporation to the
applicable Tax authorities, the Employer Tax Amount arising out of the payment
of the amounts described in clause (ii)(B) below to the Company Award
Holders, (ii) after deduction of the Employer Tax Amount described in clause
(i), (A) to the Paying Agent for further disbursement to the Company Holders (
_pro rata_ in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages) such
remaining portion of the amount equal to the remaining amount of such
Contingent Payment payable to the Company Holders other than the Company Award
Holders, as applicable, and (B) to the Surviving Corporation for further
disbursement to the Company Award Holders ( _pro rata_ in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Percentages) an amount equal to the portion of the
remaining amount of such Contingent Payment, less applicable Tax withholding.
After the five (5) year anniversary of the Closing Date, a Buyer Indemnified
Party may recover for indemnification claims under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_
relating to or arising out of a breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations, the Extended IP Representations or the Tax Representations,
or under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)-(f)_; _provided_ such recovery shall be
limited to the Right of Setoff.

 

(c) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Indemnifiable
Damages with respect (i) to any Liability reflected in the Estimated Closing
Statement, up to the amount of such Liability reflected in the Estimated
Closing Statement or (ii) to the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
have already recovered the same Indemnifiable Damages with respect to such
indemnifiable matter pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement.

(d) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall take such commercially reasonable
actions as are available to them to mitigate the amount of any Damages (other
than mitigation efforts that would be harmful to Buyer or the business of the
Company; _provided_ that a mitigation effort shall not be considered harmful
to Buyer or the business of the Company simply because it will limit Buyers
recovery for Indemnifiable Damages in accordance with this _Article 8_ ). The
amount of Indemnifiable Damages payable under this  _Article 8_ shall be
reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds actually received from an insurance
carrier by the Buyer Indemnified Party with respect thereto (net of any
applicable deductibles or similar costs or payments), (ii) indemnity or
contribution amounts actually received from third parties (net of any
applicable costs of recovery or collection

 



85

    

 thereof) and (iii) any tax deduction or other tax benefit, if any, actually
recognized by any Indemnified Party as a result of incurring such Damages in
the Taxable year in which such Damages are incurred; _provided_ , that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_ shall require a Buyer Indemnified
Party to litigate any dispute to obtain any insurance proceeds, indemnity or
contribution amount; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if a Buyer Indemnified
Party receives insurance proceeds, indemnity or contribution amounts or
recognizes tax benefits, including the receipt of tax refunds or a reduction
in cash taxes payable, after having received payment from (or on behalf of)
any Company Holders with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages, such Buyer
Indemnified Party shall pay to the Shareholders Representative the lesser of
(x) the amount of the insurance proceeds received and tax benefits and (y)
the amount of indemnification received by the Buyer Indemnified Party from the
Company Holders, and the Shareholders Representative will distribute such
funds to the Company Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentage.

(e) Materiality standards or qualifications or any references to Material
Adverse Effects in any representation, warranty or covenant shall not be
taken into account in determining whether a breach of or default in connection
with such representation, warranty or covenant (or failure of any
representation or warranty to be true and correct) exists, or in determining
the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages with respect to such breach, default
or failure.

(f) Indemnifiable Damages will be limited to actual Damages incurred by the
Indemnified Parties and will exclude exemplary or punitive Damages, or special
Damages that are in the nature of exemplary or punitive Damages (except to the
extent such types of Damages are specifically awarded by an arbitrator or
Governmental Entity to a third party and paid to such third party by an
Indemnified Party in connection with a Third-Party Claim).

 

Section 8.4 _Notification of Certain Claims_.

 

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party or Company Holder (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") believes that it has a bona fide claim for indemnification pursuant
to this _Article 8_ , other than in respect of a Third-Party Claim, then Buyer
(if such Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party) or the Shareholders
Representative (if such Indemnified Party is a Company Holder), as the case
may be, shall promptly deliver to the Shareholders Representative or Buyer,
respectively, a certificate (any certificate delivered in accordance with the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_, a " _Claim Certificate_ "): (i)
stating that an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this _Article 8_ ; (ii) containing a calculation, prepared in good faith, of
the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled to receive,
which shall be the amount of Damages such Indemnified Party claims to have so
incurred or suffered or could reasonably be expected to incur or suffer
and (iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Buyer or the Shareholders Representative, as the case may be)
the material facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such claim.

 

(b) Buyer is the sole and exclusive Person authorized to act for and bring
claims on behalf of Buyer Indemnified Parties, and the Shareholders
Representative is the sole and exclusive Person authorized to act for and
bring claims on behalf of Company Holders.

 



86

    

(c) No delay in providing such Claim Certificate will affect an
Indemnified Partys rights hereunder except to the extent that (and then only
to the extent that) the indemnifying party is adversely prejudiced thereby.

 

(d) If the Escrow Fund is available to satisfy the recovery of the claim
asserted in such Claim Certificate and has not been fully released, at the
time of delivery of any Claim Certificate to the Shareholders Representative,
a duplicate copy of such Claim Certificate shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent by or on behalf of Buyer (on behalf of itself or any other Buyer
Indemnified Party).

(e) If the Shareholders Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, objects
to any claim made in any Claim Certificate, then the Shareholders
Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, shall deliver a written notice (a
" _Claim Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer or the Shareholders Representative, as
the case may be, during the 30-day period commencing upon receipt by the
Shareholders Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, of the Claim
Certificate. The Claim Dispute Notice will set forth the principal basis
for the dispute of any claim made in the applicable Claim Certificate. If the
Shareholders Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, does not deliver a
Claim Dispute Notice hereunder prior to the expiration of such 30-day period,
then such claim for indemnification set forth in such Claim Certificate shall
be deemed to have been conclusively determined in favor of the Indemnified
Party that delivered the Claim Certificate for purposes of this _Article 8_
on the terms set forth in the Claim Certificate and the applicable Indemnified
Party will be indemnified for the amount of the Damages set forth in the Claim
Certificate pursuant to this _Article 8_.

 

(f) If a Claim Dispute Notice is properly delivered hereunder, then Buyer and
the Shareholders Representative will attempt in good faith to resolve any
such objections raised in such Claim Dispute Notice. If Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative agree to a resolution of such objection, then a
memorandum setting forth the matters conclusively determined by Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative will be prepared and signed by both Parties.

(g) If no such resolution can be reached during the 30-day period following
receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice hereunder, then upon the expiration of
such 30-day period, either Buyer or the Shareholders Representative may
bring suit to resolve the objection in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.5_.

 

Section 8.5 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party or Company Holder receives notice of any
Action that has been or may be brought or asserted by a third party against
such Indemnified Party and that may give rise to a claim by such Indemnified
Party for Damages under this _Article 8_ (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ "),
such Indemnified Party will, promptly after receipt of notice of any such
Third-Party Claim, notify the Shareholders Representative of such Third-Party
Claim where one or more of the Company Holders are the Person(s) from whom
indemnification is sought and notify Buyer where Buyer is the Person from
whom indemnification is sought, in each case by the delivery of a certificate
regarding the same, which shall be deemed a Claim Certificate. The failure of
an Indemnified Party to so notify the party from whom indemnification is being
sought of the commencement of any such Third-Party Claim will not relieve any
party from liability in

 



87

    

 connection therewith, except to the extent that such failure materially and
adversely affects the ability of such party from whom indemnification is being
sought to defend its interests in such Third-Party Claim.

(b) Buyer, upon written notice to the Shareholders Representative, will have
the right in its sole discretion to assume and control the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that the Shareholders Representative and
its counsel (at Shareholders Representatives sole expense on behalf of the
Company Holders) may participate in (but not control the conduct of) the
defense of such Action except to the extent such participation would adversely
affect any privilege of Buyer or a Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of
such Third-Party Claim. Buyer will have the right, in its sole discretion, to
settle any Third-Party Claim, but no settlement of any such Third-Party Claim
with third party claimants will be determinative of whether such Third-Party
Claim gives rise to any right to indemnification hereunder, and, if so, the
amount of, Damages under this _Article 8_ relating to such matter unless the
Shareholders Representative consents to such settlement (and the Company
Holders shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party for
any Damages payable pursuant to a settlement to the extent that such
settlement is not reasonable, including in the amount of costs and expenses
agreed to in such settlement). In the event that the Shareholders
Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Company Holders will
have no power or authority to object under any provision of this _Article 8_
to the amount of Damages with respect to such settlement.

(c) If requested by Buyer, the Shareholders Representative will enter into a
separate confidentiality or joint defense agreement prior to participating in
the defense of any Third-Party Claim.

(d) The party controlling the defense of a Third-Party Claim will (i) keep
the non-controlling party reasonably advised of the status of such Third-Party
Claim and the defense thereof and will consider in good faith recommendations
made by the non-controlling party with respect thereto and (ii) make available
to the non-controlling party any documents or materials in its possession or
control that may be necessary to understand the defense of such claim (subject
to confidentiality obligations and the protection of the attorney-client
privilege). The non-controlling party will reasonably cooperate with and
assist the controlling party in the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
including by furnishing the controlling party with such information as it may
have with respect to such Third-Party Claim (including copies of any summons,
complaints or other proceedings which may have been served on such party and
any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting the same).

 

(e) Costs and expenses (including attorneys fees, costs and other expenses
incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any applicable claim or
Action) shall constitute Indemnifiable Damages for which a Buyer Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification if and solely to the extent that such
underlying claim or Action gives rise to Indemnifiable Damages for which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(a)_ (without taking into account such costs and expenses).

 

Section 8.6 _Treatment of Adjustments_. The Company Holders, on the one hand,
and Buyer and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree that, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, all payments made by or on behalf of either of
them to or for the benefit of the other

 



88

    

 (including any payments to the Company) under this _Article 8_ will be
treated as adjustments to the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
for Tax purposes and that such treatment will govern for purposes hereof.

Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, this _Article 8_ , will be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Company Holders from
and after the Closing Date for any claims arising under this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that the foregoing sentence will not be deemed a waiver
by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive or equitable
relief, any right or remedy arising from a criminal Action, or any right or
remedy arising by reason of any claim of fraud.

ARTICLE 9

91

    

 obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 9.4 _Consents and Approvals_. For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any Party, to be valid and binding on
the Parties, such consent or approval must be in writing.

 

Section 9.5 _Enforcement_.

 

(a) Each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Chancery Court, and any federal court of the United States of
America sitting in the State of Delaware, for the purposes of any suit, action
or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby. Each Party agrees to commence any such action, suit
or proceeding either in the Delaware Chancery Court or if such suit, action
or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional
reasons, in any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware. Each Party further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by the U.S. registered mail to such Partys
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to
which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_. Each
Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the Delaware Chancery Court, and (ii)
any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware, and hereby and thereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. This _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ shall not apply to any dispute
under _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ that is required to be decided by the Accounting
Firm.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY. Each
Party hereto (i) certifies that no Representative of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such Party would not, in the event
of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(ii) acknowledges that it and the other Parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.5_.

Section 9.6 _Amendment and Waiver_.

 

(a) No failure or delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.

 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time, whether before or after
the Shareholder Approval has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
after the Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by shareholders of either
Party, without the further approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may
not be amended,

 



92

    

 supplemented or modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the Parties; _provided_ that, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, Buyer and the Shareholders Representative may cause this Agreement to
be amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative. In the
case of a waiver, such waiver shall be effective only if it is made or given
in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver and shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which made or
given.

 

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with all annexes,
schedules (including the Disclosure Schedule) and exhibits and all ancillary
agreements, documents or instruments to be delivered in connection herewith
and therewith, contain the entire agreement and understanding between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior discussions, negotiations, commitments, agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, relating to such subject matter.

 

Section 9.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties
and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing herein expressed or
implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
Parties and such successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder.

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile, .pdf or other electronically transmitted signatures and such
signatures shall be deemed to bind each Party hereto as if they were the
original signatures.

 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all matters relating to or
arising out of this Agreement (whether sounding in contract, tort or
otherwise) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
substantive Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws thereof.

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that
irreparable damage would occur (for which monetary relief, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy) in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, as
applicable, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, including if the
parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. It is
accordingly agreed that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by any of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, as
applicable, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
against Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, in any court having
jurisdiction, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled at law or in equity
and (ii) the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither the Company nor Buyer would have entered into this
Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable

 



93

    

 relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the Parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 9.11_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall this  _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, be used,
alone or together with any other provision of this Agreement, to require the
Company to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company
made herein.

 

Section 9.12 _Representation_. Each of the Parties hereby agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees
and Affiliates, that Fenwick and West LLP may serve as counsel to each and any
of the Shareholders Representative, the Company Holders and their respective
Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the
one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Fenwick
and West LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any
director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller
Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement notwithstanding such representation of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, even though the interests of the Shareholders
Representative, the Company Holders and other members of the Seller Group may
be directly adverse to Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, and each of the Parties hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Affiliate thereof to
consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation.
The Parties agree that any privilege attaching as a result of Fenwick and West
LLP representing the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute arising in
connection with, this Agreement or any agreement entered into pursuant to this
Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, provided
that such privilege from and after the Closing shall be controlled by the
Shareholders Representative, and all communications prior to the Closing
between the Company or any of its employees, directors or advisors, the
Shareholders Representative, any Company Holder or any other member of the
Seller Group, and any third parties, on the one hand, and Fenwick and West on
the other, shall be deemed to be the confidential communications of the
Company Holders and the Shareholders Representative (and shall be controlled
by the Shareholders Representative). As to any privileged attorney-client
communications between Fenwick and West LLP and the Company or any of its
employees, directors or advisors, the Shareholders Representative, any
Company Holder or any other member of the Seller Group prior to the Closing
Date (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), each of
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, and its Subsidiaries together with any of
their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that
no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any
action against or involving any member of the Seller Group, after the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and a Person other than a member of the Seller
Group, on the other hand, after the Closing, Buyer, the Surviving

 



94

    

 Corporation and any of their respective Affiliates may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third-party of such privileged
communications; _provided_ that none of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Shareholders Representative.

 

Section 9.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

SCHEDULE 5.4

 

REGISTRATION OF BUYER COMMON STOCK

 

Section 1\. _Registrable Securities_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _Registrable Securities_ " shall mean all of the shares of Buyer Common
Stock to be issued to Company Holders under this Agreement (the " _Closing
Shares_ ") other than shares of Buyer Common Stock issued to a Company Holder
that has not provided the information required by paragraph 7 one Business
Day prior to the filing of the Resale Registration Statement.

 

Section 2\. _Resale Registration Statement_. Buyer agrees that it will file a
prospectus supplement to Buyers registration statement on Form S-3ASR filed
October 2, 2017 (File No. 333-220759) (or another registration statement on
Form S-3, or such other form under the Securities Act then available to
Buyer), providing for the resale pursuant to Rule 415 from time to time, and
on a continuing basis, by each holder thereof (each a " _Holder_ "), of the
Registrable Securities (such registration statement, including the prospectus,
any pre-effective or post-effective amendments and supplements thereto, all
exhibits thereto and all material incorporated by reference or deemed to be
incorporated by reference, if any, therein being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Resale Registration Statement_ " and such prospectus supplement,
including the base prospectus included in the Resale Registration Statement,
the " _Resale Prospectus Supplement_ "). Buyer agrees to file the Resale
Prospectus Supplement within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that Buyer will be permitted to postpone or suspend (upon
written notice to the Holders) the use of the Resale Prospectus Supplement or
the Resale Registration Statement (on one or more occasions) (a) if the
disclosure requirements of the Securities Act in connection with the Resale
Registration Statement would require Buyer to include material information
(including information to supplement, update or correct existing disclosures)
that has not theretofore been included or incorporated by reference in the
Resale Registration Statement and Buyers Board of Directors has determined in
its reasonable judgment that Buyer has a bona fide business reason not to
disclose such material information; provided, that the aggregate number of
days Buyer shall be permitted to so postpone or suspend the use of the Resale
Prospectus Supplement or effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement
shall not exceed thirty (30) consecutive days or an aggregate of sixty (60)
days in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, or (b) if the SEC shall
determine (and notify Buyer) that financial statements required to be included
or incorporated by reference in the Resale Registration Statement or Resale
Prospectus Supplement pursuant to Rules 3-05 and 11-01 of Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC related to an acquisition by the Company are not yet
so included or incorporated; provided, that (1) Buyer shall consult with the
Holders promptly upon receipt of any such notice and shall permit counsel for
the Holders to participate in any discussions with the SEC regarding
such determination; (2) such postponement or suspension of the use of the
Resale Prospectus Supplement or effectiveness of the Resale Registration
Statement shall only continue until such time any such required financial
statements are included or incorporated; and (3) Buyer shall be not permitted
to so postpone or suspend the use of the Resale Prospectus Supplement or the
Resale Registration Statement after (or for a period ending after) the date
five Business Days after the Closing Date.

Section 3\. _Withdrawal_. Any Holder on behalf of whom any Registrable
Securities have been included in the Resale Prospectus Supplement shall have
the right to withdraw any or

 



1

    

 all of the Registrable Securities to be registered thereby by giving written
notice to such effect to Buyer prior to the filing of the Resale Prospectus
Supplement.

 

Section 4\. _Registration Procedures_. In connection with the Resale
Registration Statement, Buyer shall:

 

(a) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to
remain effective for a continuous period of not less than one (1) year __ or,
if earlier, until the termination of the Buyers registration obligations
pursuant to paragraph 6, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to as
promptly as is practicable obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the
registration or qualification (or the effectiveness thereof) or suspending or
preventing the use of any related prospectus in any jurisdiction with respect
thereto;

 

(b) notify as promptly as reasonably practicable each seller of Registrable
Securities of each of (A) the filing of the Resale Prospectus Supplement and
any amendment or supplements thereto, (B) the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or any state securities law authorities or any other governmental
authorities with respect to any such registration statement or Resale
Prospectus Supplement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and (C) any
oral or written stop order with respect to such registration, any suspension
of the registration or qualification of the sale of such Registrable
Securities in any jurisdiction, or any initiation or threatening of any
proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing; provided that Buyer shall
not be required to notify sellers of Registrable Securities of any events
described in (A) to (C) of this paragraph related to the Shelf Registration
Statement that do not affect the availability of the Resale Prospectus
Supplement;

 

(c) if requested, furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities, the
underwriters, and the sales or placement agent, if any, and counsel for each
of the foregoing, a conformed copy of such registration statement and each
amendment and supplement thereto (in each case, including all exhibits thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein) and such additional number
of copies of such registration statement, each amendment, and supplement
thereto (in such case without such exhibits and documents), the prospectus
(including each preliminary prospectus) included in such registration
statement, and the Resale Prospectus Supplements and all exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, and such other documents as such
seller, underwriter, agent, or counsel may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such
seller; provided, that Buyer shall have no obligation to provide any document
pursuant to this section that is available on the SECs EDGAR system;

 

(d) use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such
Registrable Securities under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions as the holders of Registrable Securities reasonably request and
do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable the holders of Registrable Securities to consummate
the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by
such holders and keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long
as the registration statement remains effective under the Securities Act
(provided that Buyer shall not be required to (x) qualify generally to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it would not otherwise be required to
qualify but for this paragraph, (y) subject itself to taxation in any such
jurisdiction in which it would not 

 



2

    

 otherwise be subject to taxation but for this paragraph, or (z) consent to
the general service of process in any jurisdiction in which it would not
otherwise be subject to general service of process but for this paragraph);

(e) notify each seller of such Registrable Securities, at any time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, upon the discovery that, or of
the happening of any event as a result of which, the registration statement
covering such Registrable Securities, as then in effect, contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or any fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and furnish to
each such seller a supplement or amendment to the Resale Prospectus Supplement
to such registration statement so that such registration statement shall not,
and such Resale Prospectus Supplement as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of such Registrable Securities shall not, contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or any fact necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading;

(f) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities so
registered to be listed on The Nasdaq Global Market or such other national
securities exchange or established over-the-counter market as is then the
principal market on which or through which similar securities of Buyer are
then listed or traded;

(g) use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable
laws related to such registration statement and offering and sale of
securities and all applicable rules and regulations of governmental
authorities in connection therewith (including, without limitation, the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act); and 

(h) permit any Holder, which Holder, in its reasonable judgment, might be
deemed to be an underwriter or controlling Person of Buyer, to participate in
the preparation of such registration statement and to require the insertion
therein of material, furnished to Buyer in writing, that in the reasonable
judgment of such Holder and such Holders counsel should be included.

Section 5\. _Expenses_. All expenses incident to Buyers performance of, or
compliance with, its obligations under this Agreement, including, without
limitation, all registration and filing fees, all fees and expenses of
compliance with securities and "blue sky" laws, all printing and copying
expenses, all messenger and delivery expenses, all fees and expenses of
Buyers independent counsel (collectively, the " _Registration Expenses_ ")
shall be borne by Buyer. Buyer shall not be responsible for the fees and
expenses of any counsel, or any of the accountants, agents, or experts
retained by the Holders in connection with the sale of Registrable Securities.
Buyer will pay its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all
salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties, the expense of any annual audit, and the expense of any
liability insurance) and the expenses and fees for listing the securities to
be registered on each securities exchange and included in each established
over-the-counter market on which similar securities issued by Buyer are then
listed or traded or for listing on any other exchange or automated quotation
system.

 



3

    

Section 6\. _Termination_. Buyers obligations under Section 5.4 of the
Agreement and this Schedule 5.4 shall terminate, with respect to each Holder,
on the earliest date on which all of such Holders Registrable Securities
have: (a) been registered on the Resale Registration Statement and disposed
of in accordance therewith; (b) become eligible to be sold, without volume or
manner of sale limitations, pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
any successor rule or regulation thereto that may be adopted by the SEC, (c)
ceased to be outstanding, whether as a result of redemption, repurchase,
cancellation, exchange or otherwise, (d) been sold to the public pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor rule or regulation thereto
that may be adopted by the SEC, or (e) one year from the Closing Date. Buyer
will take such action as may reasonably requested by any Holder to remove any
restrictive legend or other restriction on resale with respect to any
Registrable Securities for which Buyers obligations under this Schedule
shall have terminated pursuant to this paragraph.

Section 7.  _Selling Stockholder Information_. Each of the Holders shall
furnish the information set forth in Part 1, the Company Holder Information
Questionnaire, included in the Investor Questionnaire to Buyer. In connection
herewith, each Holder shall be required to represent to Buyer that all such
information which is given is both complete and accurate in all material
respects when made.
