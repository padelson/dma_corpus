_Qteros Option Notice_ "), the Qteros Shares shall, subject to Buyer paying
the Qteros Asset Consideration at the Closing, be an Acquired Asset and shall
be transferred to Buyer at the Closing, but only if and to the extent that the
Qteros Shares are freely assignable and transferable at the Closing pursuant
to any Contracts governing Sellers rights with respect thereto and pursuant
to applicable Legal Requirements; _provided further_ that, in the event that
(I) Buyer has timely delivered and not withdrawn the Qteros Option Notice and
irrevocably agreed to pay the Qteros Asset Consideration to Sellers upon
Sellers having the right to freely assign and transfer the Qteros Shares to
Buyer and (II) the Qteros Shares are not freely assignable and transferable

shall cause each of the Scheduled Contracts and Leases for which Buyer
delivers an Assignment Election prior to the Designation Deadline to be
assumed and assigned to Buyer pursuant to one or more contract assignment and

21 (b) Sellers shall be responsible for the verification of all Cure Costs for
each Assigned Contract and Assigned Lease and for the Scheduled Contracts and
Leases, including all administrative responsibilities associated therewith, in
the Bankruptcy Case and otherwise, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
establish the proper Cure Cost, if any, for each Assigned Contract and
Assigned Lease (as soon as practicable and in all events prior to the
Designation Deadline, where possible), including taking all reasonable actions
with respect to the filing and prosecution of any pleadings and proceedings
in the Bankruptcy Court and the service and delivery of any related notices or
pleadings.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay any and all Pre-Closing Determined Cure
Amounts. " _Pre-Closing Determined Cure Amount_ " means the Cure Cost of a
Pre-Closing Designated Contract or Lease for which the Cure Cost thereof has
been finally established prior to the Closing Date (whether by Order of the
Bankruptcy Court or agreement among Buyer, Sellers and the applicable
counterparty thereto). " _Pre-Closing Designated Contract or Lease_ " means
(i) each Contract listed or described on  _Schedule 1.1(a)_ , (ii) each Lease

(d) (i) With respect to each Assigned Contract and Assigned Lease (other than
any Pre-Closing Designated Contract or Lease for which the Pre-Closing

Bankruptcy Court or agreement among Buyer, Sellers and the
applicable counterparty thereto) prior to the Designation Deadline, (A) if
such Cure Cost is less than or equal to the Cure Cost Escrow Amount with
respect to such Assigned Contract or Assigned Lease, Sellers shall pay,
satisfy or otherwise discharge such Cure Cost no later than the Cure Costs
Deadline and (B) if such Cure Cost is greater than the Cure Cost Escrow Amount
with respect to such Assigned Contract or Assigned Lease, (I) Sellers and
Buyer shall cause the Expense Fund Agent to release, and disburse to Buyer,
such Cure Cost Escrow Amount from the Cure Cost Account of the Expense Fund no
later than the Cure Costs Deadline, and (II) effective from and after the
earlier of such release and the Cure Costs Deadline, such Cure Cost shall be
an Assumed Liability for which Buyer is solely responsible and for which none
of Sellers shall have any liability whatsoever; and (ii) with respect to each
Assigned Contract and Assigned Lease (other than any Assigned Contract or
Assigned Lease for which the Pre-Closing Determined Cure Amount is paid
pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_) as to which the Cure Cost thereof has not been
finally established (whether by Order of the Bankruptcy Court or
agreement among Buyer, Sellers and the applicable counterparty thereto) prior
to the Designation Deadline, Sellers and Buyer shall cause the Expense Fund
Agent to release, and disburse to Buyer, the Cure Cost Escrow Amount with
respect to such Assigned Contract or Assigned Lease from the Cure Cost
Account of the Expense Fund no later than the Cure Costs Deadline, and,
effective from and after the earlier of such release and the Cure Costs
Deadline, such Cure Cost shall be an Assumed Liability for which Buyer is
solely responsible and for which none of Sellers shall have any liability
whatsoever. Sellers and Buyer shall cause the Expense Fund Agent to release
and disburse the amount of the applicable Cure Cost from the Cure Cost
Account of the Expense Fund, to the extent funds are available therein, for
the purpose of paying any Cure Cost pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)(i)(A)_ and,
in each case, to concurrently release and disburse to Sellers the excess, if
any, of the applicable Cure Cost Escrow Amount over such Cure Cost.

Designation Deadline, Sellers may in their sole and absolute discretion,
subject to applicable Legal Requirements, assume, assign or reject any
Contract or Lease other than an Assigned Contract or Assigned Lease.

(f) From the Effective Date through and including the Designation Deadline,
(i) Sellers shall maintain and perform all Liabilities required to be
performed under each Assigned Contract, each Assigned Lease or each of the
Scheduled Contracts and Leases, subject to _Section 2.5(e)_, and (ii)

_Schedule 1.1(b)_ to _Schedule 1.1(b)-1_.

(h) Each of the Scheduled Contracts and Leases as to which Buyer has not
delivered an Assignment Election prior to the Designation Deadline shall be

2.6 _Assignment of Acquired Assets_.

To the maximum extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, the Acquired Assets
shall be assumed by and assigned to Buyer pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code as of the Closing Date or such other date as specified in the
Sale Order or this Agreement, as applicable. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign any asset or any right thereunder if an
attempted assignment without the consent of a third party, which consent has
not been obtained prior to the Closing (after giving effect to the Sale Order
and the Bankruptcy Code), would be legally invalid. If with respect to any
Acquired Asset such consent is not obtained or such assignment is not
attainable pursuant to Sections 105, 363 or 365 of the Bankruptcy Code other
than as a result of the failure to pay Cure Costs (other than Cure Costs to be
paid by Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.5_), then such Acquired Asset shall not
be transferred hereunder and the Closing shall proceed with respect to the
remaining Acquired Assets without any reduction in the Purchase Price. In the
case of licenses, certificates, approvals, authorizations, leases, Contracts
and other commitments included in the Acquired Assets (i) that cannot be
transferred or assigned without the consent of third parties, which consent
has not been obtained prior to the Closing (after giving effect to the
Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), Sellers shall, at Buyers sole expense
and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required,
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in endeavoring to obtain such consent and, if
any such consent is not obtained, Sellers shall, following the Closing, at
Buyers sole expense and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that
may be required, cooperate with Buyer in all reasonable  



 

23  respects to provide to Buyer the benefits thereof in some other manner, or
(ii) that are otherwise not transferable or assignable (after giving
effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), Sellers shall, following
the Closing, at Buyers sole expense and subject to any approval of the
Bankruptcy Court that may be required, reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
provide to Buyer the benefits thereof in some other manner (including the
exercise of the rights of Sellers thereunder); _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 2.6_ shall (x) require Sellers to make any expenditure or incur any
obligation on their own or on behalf of Buyer or Parent for which funds in
the full amount of such expenditure or obligation are not provided to Sellers
by Buyer in advance in cash or (y) prohibit any Seller from ceasing operations
or winding up its affairs following the Closing.

2.7 _Covenant Not to Sue_.

The Parties acknowledge that certain Trade Secrets owned by Sellers may exist
in the Facilities or other Acquired Assets or in the knowledge of the
individuals employed at the Facilities as of the Closing Date. Sellers shall
not challenge Buyers or its Affiliates (or any of their respective
successors or assigns) use of such Trade Secrets for any purpose. Buyer and
Parent acknowledge that Sellers may use or permit others to use such Trade
Secrets for any purpose, and Buyer and Parent shall not challenge such use.
Each of Buyer and Parent, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
expressly (i) releases the other from any Liabilities arising out of the use
of the Trade Secrets, and (ii) waives, disclaims, and releases any rights in
and to any improvements or enhancements made to the Trade Secrets by or on
behalf of the other after the Closing Date.

2.8 _Trademark License-Back; Domain Names_.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer hereby grants to Sellers and their
Affiliates, for the period commencing upon the Closing Date and continuing
through the second (2nd) anniversary of the Domain Name Transfer Deadline,
a non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, and royalty-free
license to use the House Marks in connection with the other plants,
facilities, and goods and services of Sellers, generally consistent with past
practice of Sellers and including in connection with the disposition of such
assets. The foregoing grant in this _Section 2.8(a)_ is made by Buyer without
any representations or warranties of any nature whatsoever (whether express,
implied or statutory) regarding the House Marks including any representations
or warranties regarding Buyers, Sellers or Sellers Affiliates rights in or
rights to use the same, and neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates, nor
any of their respective sublicensees or any other Persons claiming by,
through or under any of them shall have any rights, remedies or recourse
whatsoever against Buyer with respect to the House Marks. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Sellers agree that Buyer shall have no
obligation to incur any costs or other Liabilities to maintain the House Marks
or to protect or defend them against abuse or infringement of any nature
whatsoever by any Persons.

(b) No later than the 30th day following the earlier of (i) effectiveness of a
plan of reorganization or liquidation with respect to all Sellers and/or (ii)
conversion of all Sellers cases constituting part of the Bankruptcy Case to
cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (such 30th day, the " _Domain
Name Transfer Deadline_ "), Sellers shall cause to be transferred to Buyer
all Internet domain names owned by such Sellers containing the House Marks or
close variants thereof.



 

24 2.9 _Further Assurances_.

(a) At the Closing, and at all times thereafter as may be necessary, Sellers
shall execute and deliver to Buyer such other instruments of transfer
as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to vest in Buyer good and
indefeasible title to the Acquired Assets free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than Permitted Encumbrances and to comply with the purposes and intent
of this Agreement and such other instruments as shall be reasonably necessary
or appropriate to evidence the assignment by Sellers and assumption by Buyer
of the Assigned Contracts and the Assigned Leases, and each of Sellers, on the
one hand, and Buyer and Parent, on the other hand, shall use its reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to
be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law, and
execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that
nothing in this _Section 2.9_ shall prohibit any Seller from ceasing
operations or winding up its affairs following the Closing. 

(b) Each party shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance to
enforce the covenants and agreements set forth in this  _Section 2.9_. This
_Section 2.9 _shall survive the Closing.

be to the credit of Buyer as provided in _Section 3.3(d)(ii)(A)_, or (b) in
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_  



 

25   _11.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 11.1(c)(ii)_, as provided in _Section 11.2(b)_.

3.3 _Payments on the Closing Date_.

(a) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall deliver to Buyer a written statement, reasonably satisfactory to Buyer

amounts or calculations in the Closing Statement, or should Sellers object to
any of the amounts or calculations in the Buyer Statement, Buyer and Sellers
shall cooperate in a diligent good faith manner to resolve such objections
prior to the Closing, and the Closing Statement or Buyer Statement, as
applicable, shall be adjusted prior to the Closing to reflect any changes
agreed to by Buyer and Sellers prior to the Closing. 

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to the Persons entitled thereto, as shown
on the Closing Statement, (i) all Specified Trade Payables that have been
fixed in amount and that are due and payable on or before the Closing Date, as
shown on the Closing Statement, and (ii) all Allowed Administrative
Transaction Expenses that have been fixed in amount, as shown on the Closing

26 (c) Prior to the Closing, U.S. Bank National Association, or such other Person

Agent_ "), shall establish an expense fund (the " _Expense Fund_ ") consisting
of the following three segregated, interest-bearing accounts: a Cure Cost
Account (the " _Cure Cost Account_ "), a Trade Payables Account (the " _Trade
Payables Account_ ") and an Administrative Expenses Account (the "
_Administrative Expenses Account_ "). The Expense Fund shall be
maintained pursuant to an Expense Fund Escrow Agreement substantially in the
form of _Exhibit J_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit the following
amounts, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, with the Expense
Fund Agent for deposit into the following accounts of the Expense Fund, and

each case as shown on the Closing Statement; and

(iii) into the Administrative Expenses Account, the estimated aggregate
amount of all Allowed Administrative Transaction Expenses that have not been

From time to time after the Closing, (1) Buyer and Sellers shall cause amounts
to be released and disbursed from the Cure Cost Account solely as provided in
_Section 2.5(d)_, (2) Sellers shall draw on the Trade Payables Account
solely for the purpose of paying Specified Trade Payables that become fixed in
amount and/or become due and payable on or after the Closing Date and (3)
Sellers shall draw on the Administrative Expenses Account solely for the

fixed in amount on or after the Closing Date. After the payment in full of all
amounts to be paid from the Trade Payables Account or the Administrative
Expenses Account, or, in the case of the Cure Cost Account, after the
completion of all releases and disbursements from such account required under
_Section 2.5(d)_, Sellers shall be entitled, subject to the approval of the
Bankruptcy Court, to cause any funds remaining in such account (together with
all interest accrued thereon) to be released from escrow and disbursed to
Sellers. To the extent that any amounts in either the Trade Payables Account
or Administrative Expenses Account are insufficient to pay any amounts for
which such accounts are earmarked, and to the extent that any amounts in the
Cure Cost Account are insufficient to pay any Cure Costs required to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)(i)(A)_, Sellers shall be solely and exclusively
responsible for any such deficits or shortfalls.

(d) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Sellers in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of the Company set forth in the

the Closing Direct Payments and (D) the aggregate amount of the deposits made
by Buyer at the Closing into the accounts of the Expense Fund pursuant to
_Section 3.3(c)_ (such amount to be paid to Sellers, the " _Closing
Date Payment_ "). Sellers shall be solely responsible for allocating the
Closing Date Payment among themselves (and any Affiliates, creditors or other
third parties entitled to any portion thereof), and agree that Buyer shall
have no responsibility or Liability whatsoever for or with respect to the
allocation or distribution of the Closing Date Payment beyond Buyers duty to
wire the same to the account designated in the Closing Statement.

3.4 _Discharge of Assumed Liabilities After Closing_.

Buyer shall pay, perform or satisfy the Assumed Liabilities from time to time
and as such Assumed Liabilities become due and payable or are required to be
performed or satisfied in accordance with their respective terms.

3.5 _Inventory Adjustment_.

(a) Sellers and/or Sellers Representatives shall, commencing on the Closing
Date, conduct a physical count of the Inventory as of the Closing in
accordance with the methodology prescribed by  _Schedule 1.1(d)_. Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such physical count of the
Inventory to be completed not later than the first (1st) Business Day
following the Closing Date, and Buyer may have its Representatives present
during such physical count of the Inventory. Within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of completion of such physical count of the Inventory, Sellers
shall deliver to Buyer a written statement (the " _Seller Inventory
Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers determination, together with supporting
data and calculations, of the Inventory Closing Value. Buyer and Parent shall
afford Sellers and Sellers Representatives such access to the properties,
assets and books and records of the Business and of Buyer and its Affiliates
as is necessary, in Sellers reasonable judgment, in connection with the
physical count of the Inventory, preparation of the Seller Inventory
Statement pursuant to this _Section 3.5(a) _and resolution of any dispute
hereunder with respect to the Inventory Closing Value.

(b) Unless on or before the third (3rd) Business Day after Buyers receipt of
the Seller Inventory Statement, Buyer delivers to Sellers notice disputing the
Inventory Closing Value set forth in the Seller Inventory Statement and
setting forth in reasonable detail Buyers determination of the Inventory
Closing Value and the basis therefor (such notice, the " _Buyer Objection
Notice_ "), the Inventory Final Amount shall be the Inventory Closing Value as
set forth in the Seller Inventory Statement.

(c) If Buyer timely delivers to Sellers the Buyer Objection Notice, Buyer and
Sellers shall, during the period commencing upon Sellers receipt of the
Buyer Objection Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the fifth
(5th) Business Day thereafter (such period, the " _Initial Resolution Period_
"), work in good faith to resolve any and all disputes with respect to the
Inventory Closing Value; _provided_ that items not disputed in the Buyer
Objection Notice shall be deemed not to be in dispute at any time during the
Initial Resolution Period or thereafter. If all disputes with respect to the
Inventory Closing Value are resolved during the Initial Resolution Period, the
Inventory Final Amount shall be the Inventory Closing Value as agreed upon by
Buyer and Sellers during the Initial Resolution Period.



 

28 (d) If, immediately after the Initial Resolution Period, any of the items
comprising the Inventory Closing Value remain in dispute, Buyer and Sellers
shall promptly engage an independent certified public accounting firm or
independent certified appraisal firm (the " _Inventory Arbiter_ ") mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed by Buyer or Sellers) to decide such items and shall
instruct the Inventory Arbiter to render such decision no later than
the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of commencement of such
engagement. The Inventory Arbiter shall act as an expert and not as
an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the written submissions of
Sellers and Buyer, and not by independent investigation, only the specific
items under dispute by Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.
The decision of the Inventory Arbiter shall include a statement of the
Inventory Arbiters determination of each disputed item and a statement of the
Inventory Closing Value reflecting the Inventory Arbiters determination of
all disputed items, shall be set forth in a written report delivered to
Sellers and Buyer and shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding
on the Parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Inventory Arbiter shall be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement, including  _Schedule 1.1(d)_, and
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Sellers
in the Seller Inventory Statement or Buyer in the Buyer Objection Notice, as
applicable. If the Inventory Final Amount is not established as provided in
_Section 3.5(b)_ or _Section 3.5(c)_, the Inventory Final Amount shall be
the Inventory Closing Value set forth in the decision of the Inventory
Arbiter.

(e) The " _Buyer Inventory Adjustment Amount_ " and the " _Seller Inventory
Adjustment Amount_ " are to be determined and delivered as follows: If the
Inventory Final Amount exceeds the Inventory Estimated Amount, (x) the Buyer
Inventory Adjustment Amount shall be zero, and the Seller Inventory Adjustment
Amount shall be the amount of such excess plus interest on such amount at the
Applicable Rate from (and including) the Closing Date to (and excluding) the
Inventory Adjustment Payment Date, and (y) Buyer shall deliver to Sellers the
Seller Inventory Adjustment Amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately

or lease and to operate and use its properties and to carry on its business as
now conducted. Sellers are duly qualified or licensed to do business and are
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of their
business or the nature of their properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed

5.2 _Authority; Validity; Consents_.

Each Seller has, subject to requisite Bankruptcy Court approval, the requisite
corporate or limited liability company power and authority necessary to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which such Seller is a party and to consummate the

enforceability is limited by general principles of equity. Subject to
requisite Bankruptcy Court approval, except (x) as  



 

34  required to comply with the HSR Act, (y) for entry of the Sale Order and (z)
for notices, filings and consents required in connection with the Bankruptcy

requisite Bankruptcy Court approval, have been obtained and taken, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents

the certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement of Buyer

and Buyer and Parent shall hold harmless and indemnify Sellers from any claims
with respect to any such fees or commissions.

_A CTION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE_

7.1 _Investigation of the Business by Buyer_.

After the Effective Date and prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall, in
accordance with reasonable procedures to be established in good faith by
mutual agreement of Sellers Interim Access Manager and Buyers Interim
Access Manager, (a) afford Buyers authorized Representatives access during
normal business hours to the offices, properties, key employees, outside
accountants, agreements and other documentation and financial records
(including computer files, retrieval programs and similar documentation) with
respect to the Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to
the extent Buyer reasonably deems necessary, and permit Buyer and its
authorized Representatives to make copies of such materials, (b) furnish to
Buyer or its authorized Representatives such additional information concerning
the Acquired Assets, the Business and the Assumed Liabilities as shall be
reasonably requested by Buyer or its authorized Representatives and (c) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their outside accountants and outside
counsel to cooperate with Buyer in its investigation; _provided_ that Buyer
shall submit to Sellers requests for such access, information or cooperation,
including reasonable detail regarding the requested access, information or
cooperation, a reasonable period in advance of the time at which such access,
information or cooperation is to  



 

41  be provided, and all such requests shall be submitted only to James Bonsall
(or his successors as the Companys Chief Restructuring Officer), as Sellers
designated representative, or to such other individuals as Mr. Bonsall (or
such successors) may designate from time to time to receive such requests ("
_Sellers  Interim Access Manager_"). Such requests of Buyer shall be
submitted only by Craig Schnupp, or another individual reasonably acceptable
to Sellers Interim Access Manager as Craig Schnupps successor, as Buyers
designated representative (" _Buyer s Interim Access Manager_").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such access, information
or cooperation shall be permitted or required to the extent that it would
require Sellers to disclose information subject to attorney-client
privilege.

Agreement, (w) as disclosed in _Schedule 7.2_ , (x) with the prior written

debtors in possession, to cause any of their current property insurance
policies with respect to the Facilities or any of the other Acquired Assets

unless, simultaneously with such termination, cancellation or lapse,
replacement, policies providing coverage equal to or greater than the coverage
under the canceled, terminated or lapsed policies are in full force and
effect; and



 

42 (vi) use reasonable best efforts, taking into account Sellers status as

(b) Sellers shall not:

effect to the Sale Order), sell, lease (as lessor), transfer or otherwise
dispose of, or mortgage or pledge, or voluntarily impose or suffer to be

reasonable wear and tear excepted;

this _Section 7.2_.

7.3 _HSR Act; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to _Section 7.3(c)_, as soon as reasonably practicable (and, in
any event, within five (5) Business Days) following entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order, Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer and Parent, on the other
hand, shall each prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any
notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act with the United States
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, and request early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act. Each of Buyer and Parent, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand, shall promptly respond to any requests for additional
information or documentary materials in connection with such filings and
shall, subject to _Section 7.3(d)_, take all other actions necessary to cause
the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest
practicable date after the date of filing. Buyer shall be responsible for
payment of the applicable filing fee under the HSR Act, and each Party shall
be responsible for payment of its own respective costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses) associated with
the preparation of its portion of any antitrust filings.



 

43 (b) In addition to the actions to be taken under _Section 7.3(a)_, but
subject to  _Section 7.3(d)_, Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer and
Parent, on the other hand, shall use all reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including using all
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all
reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in
_Article 9_ and _Article 10_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining, at the
earliest practicable date, of all necessary Governmental Authorizations and
the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, if any)
and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any
Proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (iii) the defending of any
Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority
vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer and Parent, on the other hand, (i)
shall promptly inform each other of any communication from any Governmental
Authority concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, and
any filing, notification or request for approval and (ii) shall permit the
other to review in advance any proposed written or material oral
communication or information submitted to any such Governmental Authority in
response thereto. In addition, none of Parties shall agree to participate in
any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, unless such Party consults with the other
Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by any such Governmental
Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat, in each case to the maximum extent practicable. Subject to any
restrictions under applicable laws, rules or regulations, each of Buyer and
Parent, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall furnish the
other with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives on the one hand, and the
Governmental Authority or members of its staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding
documents and communications which are subject to preexisting confidentiality
agreements or to the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine or
which refer to valuation of the Business) or any such filing, notification or
request for approval. Each Party shall also furnish the other Party with such
necessary information and assistance as such other Party and its Affiliates
may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary
filings, registration or submissions of information to the Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby and any such filing, notification or request for
approval.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates nor Sellers shall be required to
(i) offer, negotiate, commit to or  



 

44  effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital
stock, properties, assets, rights, products or businesses of Parent or Buyer
(or any of their respective Affiliates, if applicable), or the Business, or
(ii) permit or suffer to be imposed any other restrictions on the activities
of Parent or Buyer or their respective Affiliates or the Business.

7.4 _Bankruptcy Court Approval_.

(a) Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale of the
Acquired Assets and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts
and Assigned Leases are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. Sellers and
Buyer acknowledge that (i) to obtain such approval, Sellers must demonstrate
that they have taken reasonable steps to obtain the highest and otherwise best
offer possible for the Acquired Assets, and that such demonstration shall
include giving notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
creditors and other interested parties as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court,
and, if necessary, conducting the Auction, and (ii) Buyer must provide
adequate assurance of future performance under the to-be-assigned leases and
executory contracts.

(b) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested,
from either the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order, Sellers shall
immediately notify Buyer of such appeal or stay request and shall provide to
Buyer promptly a copy of the related notice of appeal or order of stay.
Sellers shall also provide Buyer with written notice of any motion or
application filed in connection with any appeal from either of such orders.

(c) From and after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 11.1_,
Sellers shall not take any action which is intended to (or is reasonably
likely to), or fail to take any action the intent (or the reasonably likely
result) of which failure to act is to, result in the reversal, voiding,
modification or staying of the Bidding Procedures Order or this Agreement. If
Buyer is the Successful Bidder at the Auction, Sellers shall not take any
action which is intended to (or is reasonably likely to), or fail to take any
action the intent (or the reasonably likely result) of which failure to act
is to, result in the reversal, voiding, modification or staying of the Sale
Order or this Agreement.

7.5  _Bankruptcy Filings_.

From and after the Effective Date and until the Closing Date, Sellers shall
deliver to Buyer copies of all pleadings, motions, notices, statements,
schedules, applications, reports and other papers that are filed in the
Bankruptcy Case at the time of their filing, but with respect to any such
papers that Sellers may file that relate, in whole or in part, to this
Agreement, or to Buyer or Parent or their respective agents or
representatives, Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to provide such prior
notice as may be reasonable under the circumstances before the filing of such
papers. Sellers inadvertent failure to comply with this _Section 7.5_ shall
not constitute a breach under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sellers shall not file any pleadings, motions, notices, statements, schedules,
applications, reports and other papers in the Bankruptcy Case that would, or
would reasonably be expected to, alter, modify, limit or restrict Buyers
rights or remedies pursuant to this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which may be granted or withheld in Buyers sole
discretion).



 

45 7.6 _Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement_.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after
entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, Sellers agree to pay Buyer both
the Expense Reimbursement and the Break-Up Fee in the event this Agreement is
terminated if and to the extent provided in _Section 11.2_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the terms and conditions set forth in _Section
11.2_ with respect to the payment of the Break-Up Fee shall become operative
only if and to the extent that the Bankruptcy Court enters the Bidding
Procedures Order.

7.7 _Update of Schedules; Notice of Developments_.

(a) Sellers may make modifications to _Schedule 1.1(h)_ at any time until
delivery of the Closing Statement by Sellers to Buyer, solely to reflect (i)
any new Contracts for natural gas, utilities or rail entered into by Sellers
at arms length in the ordinary course of the Business under which Sellers
have incurred or will incur pre-paid expenses or charges for goods to be
provided or services to be performed to or for the benefit of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates at any time after the Closing, or (ii) the deletion of
any Contracts from such schedule.

(b) _Schedule 1.1(d)_ shall be updated by Sellers no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date to reflect (i) all terminations and
additions, since the Effective Date, of employees who work primarily at the
Facilities or whose jobs relate primarily to the Facilities, including the
position, status and date of hire of all such employees added since the
Effective Date; _provided_ that in no event shall the aggregate number of
employees added to _Schedule 1.1(d)_ exceed the number of employees removed
from _Schedule 1.1(d)_ ; and (ii) any changes to position and status since
the Effective Date for employees listed on _Schedule 1.1(d)_.

(c) Sellers shall give prompt written notice to Buyer upon obtaining
Knowledge (i) of any development constituting a Material Adverse Effect (and
identifying it as such), (ii) that any representation or warranty made by
Sellers herein was untrue or inaccurate as of the Effective Date, (iii) of
any matter or event first arising or occurring after the Effective Date that,
if existing or occurring on or before the Effective Date, would have been
required to be set forth, disclosed or described in the schedules to
this Agreement in order for any representation or warranty made by Sellers
herein to be true and correct, (iv) of any development materially and
adversely affecting the ability of any Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (v) of any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers shall have the right,
from time to time prior to the Closing, to amend or supplement the schedules
to this Agreement with respect to any matter described in clause (iii) above.
No disclosure pursuant to this _Section 7.7(c) _and no amendment or
supplement of the schedules to this Agreement pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be deemed to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, or breach of covenant, or to otherwise affect or diminish any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Sellers in this Agreement,
for purposes of determining whether any condition set forth in _Article 9_
has been satisfied or for any other purpose. This _Section 7.7(c)_ shall not
constitute a covenant or agreement for purposes of _Section 9.2_. 



 

46 7.8 _Bidding Procedures; Segregation of Bid Deposits_.

(a) The bidding procedures to be employed with respect to this Agreement shall
be those reflected in the Bidding Procedures Order. Buyer agrees
and acknowledges that Sellers and their Representatives and Affiliates are
and may continue soliciting inquiries, proposals or offers for the Acquired
Assets in connection with any alternative transaction pursuant to the terms of
the Bidding Procedures Order.

(b) As further provided in the Bidding Procedures Order, Sellers shall
promptly segregate all bid deposits received from other bidders (if any) in
the Auction into the BUFER Account, until the aggregate amount of such
deposits equals $11,000,000. Monies held in the BUFER Account shall be
maintained free and clear of all Encumbrances whatsoever and such monies shall
not be subject to any claims by creditors of Sellers respective estates
unless and solely to the extent such monies are disbursed to the Sellers
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Upon the termination of this
Agreement under any circumstance resulting in Buyer being entitled to receive
the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement in accordance with the
applicable provisions of _Section 11.2_, the Break-Up Fee and/or Expense
Reimbursement (as applicable) shall be disbursed to Buyer from the BUFER
Account and, thereafter, any remaining moneys held in the BUFER Account shall
be released to Sellers or as the Bankruptcy Court may otherwise direct. The
Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement (i) shall be funded from the VSE Bid
Deposit of the Successful Bidder for the Acquired Assets, (ii) shall be
secured by a first priority, unprimable security interest in the VSE Bid
Deposit of the Successful Bidder for the Acquired Assets and perfected by
language in the Bidding Procedures Order, without need for further action to
perfect such security interest, (iii) shall be approved and payment authorized
by the Bankruptcy Court in the Bidding Procedures Order and (iv) shall
automatically be deemed an allowed super priority administrative expense
under Sections 503(b)(1) and 364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bidding
Procedures Order. The VSE Bid Deposit of the Successful Bidder for the
Acquired Assets shall not be the sole source for payment to Buyer of the
Break-Up Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement to which Buyer is entitled pursuant
to the applicable provisions of _Section 11.2_, and, in the event that the
VSE Bid Deposit of the Successful Bidder for the Acquired Assets shall be
unavailable, or to the extent that the VSE Bid Deposit of the Successful
Bidder for the Acquired Assets shall be insufficient, to pay to Buyer the full
amount of the Break-Up Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement to which Buyer
is entitled pursuant to the applicable provisions of _Section 11.2_, the
Break-Up Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement, to the extent not paid to Buyer
from the VSE Bid Deposit of the Successful Bidder for the Acquired Assets,
shall remain a super priority administrative expense of Sellers under Section
364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code with priority over any and all administrative
expenses of any kind, including those specified in Section 503(b) or 507(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code.

7.9 _Communications with Customers and Suppliers_.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, Sellers will use
their reasonable best efforts to arrange for meetings or discussions
between Representatives of Buyer and material customers and vendors of the
Business designated by Buyer, such meetings or discussions to be held at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Auction (provided that Buyer timely
designates such customers and vendors to Sellers). In addition, in accordance
with the  



 

47  procedures for requesting access, information or cooperation under _Section
7.1_, Buyer shall have the right to contact (i) any counterparties to
Assigned Contracts, Assigned Leases or Scheduled Contracts and Leases who
object to Cure Costs set forth in any Cure Notices sent to them, and (ii)
Governmental Authorities, to confirm the amount of any Taxes of Sellers that
Buyer is or may become liable for under this Agreement and to discuss the
status of any economic development or similar agreements between any Seller
and such Governmental Authorities. Other than as set forth in the preceding
two sentences or with the prior consent of Sellers (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), prior to the Closing, Buyer
and Parent shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and
Representatives not to, contact, or engage in any discussions or otherwise
communicate with, any of Sellers customers, suppliers and other Persons with
which Sellers have material commercial dealings where the subject matter
thereof relates to Sellers, the Acquired Assets, the Business, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that
contacts, discussions and communications with such Persons in the ordinary
course of Parents and its Affiliates existing business shall not be
restricted by this  _Section 7.9_).

7.10 _Transition Services_.

Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to finalize, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date, but in all events prior to the Auction,
any sections marked "TBD" or "to be determined" in the exhibits to the
Transition Services Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit P_.

7.11 _Cessation or Reduction of Operations_.

Should Sellers, for any reason, either cease to operate any of the Facilities
prior to Closing or materially reduce production at any of the Facilities
prior to Closing, then Buyer shall not be obligated to assume any Assigned
Contracts (whether the same are Approved Commercial Contracts, Assumed
Contracts or otherwise) that Buyer cannot reasonably be expected to honor or
perform under after Closing as a result of such cessation or reduction of
operations. In such event, the parties shall consult in good faith and make
such adjustments to the list of Assigned Contracts as is appropriate under
the circumstances, and reflect such adjustment in an amendment to this
Agreement that does not otherwise alter this Agreement.

7.12  _Approved Commercial Contracts_.

Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
provide Buyer with a schedule listing all then-executory Approved Commercial
Contracts, setting forth, for each Approved Commercial Contract on such
schedule, the name of the counterparty thereto, a description of the type and
quantity of goods covered thereby, an estimated dollar value thereof, and the
delivery and/or other key performance dates thereunder. Upon Buyers request,
Sellers shall promptly provide Buyer with copies of any Approved Commercial
Contracts disclosed on any such schedule. 

7.13 _Approved Contracts_.

Except for Approved Commercial Contracts or as otherwise required by Legal
Requirements, the Parties agree that to the extent Sellers enter into any
Contract with a third party in the ordinary course of the Business during the
period from the Effective Date to the  



 

48  Closing Date, no such Contract shall be assigned to and assumed by Buyer
hereunder unless and until Buyer designates such Contract as an Approved
Contract. In order to permit Buyer to evaluate whether it will designate any
Contract as an Approved Contract, Sellers covenant and agree to provide Buyer
with prompt notice of any such Contract being entered into that involves
consideration of $50,000 or more or that could reasonably be considered
critical for the continued operation of the Business consistent with past
practice or to enable the Facilities or the Business to comply with any Legal
Requirement. To the extent that Buyer desires to assume Sellers rights and
obligations under any such Contract, the Parties shall amend _Schedule 1.1(a)_
to include any such Contract identified by Buyer as an Approved Contract.

7.14 _Pre-Closing Owned Real Property Matters_.

Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree that (i) as of the Effective Date, the
legal descriptions for Owned Real Property in _Schedule 5.4(a)-1_ are
identical to legal descriptions contained in the title commitments issued by
the Title Company and (ii) such legal descriptions are subject to revision
based on (A) reasonable comments provided to the Title Company by Buyer and
(B) review of a final, updated ALTA/ACSM survey of each of the Facilities and
the Office Building. To the extent that the legal descriptions contained in a
title commitment for any Facility or the Office Building are revised (whether
one or more times), Sellers and Buyer agree to amend this Agreement to update
the legal descriptions contained in _Schedule 5.4(a)-1_ to match the legal
descriptions appearing in the revised title commitments. Sellers agree to use
reasonable best efforts to obtain ALTA/ACSM land title surveys of each of the
Facilities and the Office Building prior to the Closing.

7.15 _Off-Site Equipment_.

With respect to the oil extraction equipment and the equipment associated with
the Facility in Reynolds, Indiana, in each case listed on _Schedule 2.2(d)_ ,
Buyer shall have the right, by written notice to Sellers given not later than
ten (10) days prior to the Sale Hearing, to elect to acquire all of Sellers
right, title and interest in and to such equipment, on the condition that
Buyer shall be required to take assignment of the existing vendor contracts
related to such equipment (as shown on _Schedule 2.2(d)_ ) at the Closing and
pay any cure costs that must be paid, including pursuant to Sections
365(b)(1)(A) and (B) of the Bankruptcy Code, in order to enable Sellers to
assume such Contracts and assign them to Buyer. However, Buyer shall not be
required to reimburse Sellers for any amounts paid by Sellers for such
equipment.

ARTICLE 8

_A DDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

8.1 _Taxes_.

(a) Any sales Tax, use Tax or similar Tax attributable to the sale or transfer
of the Acquired Assets and not exempted under the Sale Order or by Section
1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code ( " _Sales Taxes_ ") and any real property
transfer Tax, documentary stamp Tax or similar Tax attributable to the sale or
transfer of the Acquired Assets and not exempted under the Sale Order or by
Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be  



 

49  borne one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer. Sellers and Buyer shall use
reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt the sale and
transfer of the Acquired Assets from any such Sales Taxes and Transfer Taxes,
and in furtherance thereof, Buyer shall provide Sellers with any exemption
certificates, resale certificates or similar certificates that may be
applicable to Buyer or any of its Affiliates acquiring any of the Acquired
Assets. Sellers shall be responsible for preparing and filing all necessary
Tax Returns or other documents with respect to Sales Taxes, and Buyer shall be
responsible for preparing and filing Tax Returns with respect to Transfer
Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any such Tax Return requires
execution by the other Party, the Party responsible for preparing the Tax
Return shall deliver it to the other Party not less than ten days before the
due date thereof, and the other Party shall promptly execute such Tax Return
and return it to the Party responsible for filing it.

(b) All liability for any real or personal property Taxes with respect to the
Acquired Assets for a Tax period or year, or portion thereof, that ends on or
before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") shall be borne by
Sellers. All liability for any real or personal property Taxes with respect to
the Acquired Assets for a Tax period or year, or portion thereof, that begins
after the Closing Date (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ ") shall be borne
by Buyer. The total amount of such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period of any Tax period or year commencing on or before, and ending after,
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be the product of (i) such
Tax for the entirety of such Straddle Period, multiplied by (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days for such Straddle Period included
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in such Straddle Period, and the balance of such Taxes shall be
allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. At the Closing, the real and
personal property Taxes with respect to each Acquired Asset for the applicable
Straddle Period shall be prorated in accordance with the foregoing provisions
based on the property Tax assessment for such Acquired Asset for such Straddle
Period, if available, or if otherwise, based on the property Taxes paid with
respect to such Acquired Asset during the preceding Tax year. With respect to
any not yet delinquent Taxes relating to a Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Buyer will assume responsibility for the actual payment of all such
Taxes to the applicable Governmental Authority. With respect to any Taxes
relating to a Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax Period that are delinquent as
of the Closing Date, the amount of which is known and not subject to dispute,
Buyer shall either pay the delinquent amount of such Taxes directly to the
applicable Governmental Authority at the Closing or, at Buyers option, to
the Title Company at the Closing, for further payment by it to the applicable
Governmental Authority. With respect to any Taxes relating to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period which are either due and payable or delinquent, in the event that
Buyer elects to cause such Taxes to be paid at or prior to Closing, any
Permitted Encumbrances listed in _Schedule 1.1(g)_ concerning such paid Taxes
shall not be listed as a Permitted Encumbrance in the deed for the applicable
Owned Real Property.

(c) Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, as the case may be
(the " _Reimbursing Party_ "), shall provide reimbursement for any Tax paid by
the other (the " _Paying Party_ ") all or a portion of which is the
responsibility of the Reimbursing Party in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 8.1_ or which represents an overpayment for Taxes by the Paying
Party. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any such Tax, the
Paying Party shall give notice to the Reimbursing Party of the Tax
payable and the Paying Partys and Reimbursing Partys respective liability
therefor, although failure to do so will not relieve the  



 

50  Reimbursing Party from its liability hereunder except to the extent the
Reimbursing Party is prejudiced thereby. Any amounts which may become payable
from any Seller to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_ shall constitute
a constitute a super priority administrative expense of Sellers under Section
364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code with priority over any and all
administrative expenses of the kind specified in Sections 503(b) or 507(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code.

(d) Buyer and Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business and the Acquired Assets (including access
to books and records and Tax Returns and related working papers dated
before Closing) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns,
the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by
any taxing authority, the prosecution or defense of any claims, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax, and the claiming by Buyer of any federal,
state or local business tax credits or incentives that Buyer may qualify for
in any of the jurisdictions in which any of the Acquired Assets are located;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer nor any Seller shall be required
to disclose the contents of its income Tax Returns to any Person. Any expenses
incurred in furnishing such information or assistance pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(d)_ shall be borne by the Party requesting it.

(e) Buyer and Sellers hereby waive compliance with all "bulk sales," "bulk
transfer" and similar laws that may otherwise be applicable with respect to
the sale and transfer of any or all of the Acquired Assets to Buyer.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Buyer be responsible for any income taxes or their equivalent payable by
Sellers as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor
shall Buyer be responsible or liable for any "clawback" provisions or
retractions of any tax credits or incentives assessed against any Sellers or
their Affiliates for periods during which Sellers owned the Acquired Assets.

8.2 _Payments Received_.

Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, each agree that,
after the Closing, each will hold and will promptly transfer and deliver to
the other, from time to time as and when received by them, any cash, checks
with appropriate endorsements (using their best efforts not to convert such
checks into cash) or other property that they may receive on or after the
Closing which properly belongs to the other and will account to the other for
all such receipts.

8.3 _Assigned Contracts and Assigned Leases: Adequate Assurance and
Performance_.

(a) With respect to each Assigned Contract and each Assigned Lease, Buyer
shall provide adequate assurance as required under the Bankruptcy Code of
the future performance by Buyer of each such Assigned Contract or Assigned
Lease. Buyer and Sellers agree that they will promptly take all actions
reasonably required to assist in obtaining a Bankruptcy Court finding that
there has been an adequate demonstration of adequate assurance of future
performance under the Assigned Contracts and the Assigned Leases, such as
furnishing  



 

51  timely requested and factually accurate affidavits, non-confidential
financial information and other documents or information for filing with the
Bankruptcy Court and making Buyers and Sellers employees and
representatives available to testify before the Bankruptcy Court.

(b) Buyer shall pay, perform or satisfy the Assumed Liabilities from time to
time and as such Assumed Liabilities become due and payable or are required to
be performed or satisfied in accordance with their respective terms.

(c) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 8.3(a)_, Buyer acknowledges
that Sellers have no duty to maintain any letters of credit to secure
performance or payment under any Assigned Contracts or Assigned Leases after
the Closing, and Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with Sellers in Sellers
efforts to secure the release of any such letters of credit posted by
Sellers, such cooperation to include, if necessary, the provision by Buyer of
a Parent guaranty or letter of credit to secure Buyers payment and/or
performance under any Assigned Contracts or Assigned Leases after the Closing.

8.4 _Employee Matters_.

(a)  _Transferred Employees_. Buyer shall offer employment effective as of
the Closing Date to all of the Facility Employees (identified on _Schedule
1.1(d)_ , as updated pursuant to _Section 7.7(b)_) who are active (i.e., not
out on short or long term disability or workers compensation or for any other
reason other than normal vacation absences) as of Closing, at the same
location and rate of pay and otherwise on substantially similar terms, in the
aggregate, as those under which each such Facility Employee was employed
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Those employees who accept Buyers
offer of employment made pursuant to this _Section 8.4(a)_ and commence
working for Buyer on the Closing Date are referred to herein as "
_Transferred Employees_." Each Facility Employee who is not an active employee
as of the Closing Date (each an " _Inactive Employee_ ") shall remain Sellers
responsibility until such employee commences employment with Buyer. When an
Inactive Employee is able to return to active status in accordance with
Sellers leave policies, and _provided_ that such return occurs within six (6)
months of the Closing Date unless the Inactive Employee is otherwise required
by applicable Legal Requirements to be reinstated at a later date, Buyer shall
make such offer of employment to such individual in accordance with this
Section _8.4(a)_ , and, provided such individual accepts Buyers offer of
employment, such individual will be considered a Transferred Employee as of
the date of such acceptance. Buyer shall have no liability for any Inactive
Employee until the date such employee becomes a Transferred Employee. All
Buyers decisions to offer or not offer employment to Sellers employees shall
be in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

(b) _Credit Under Buyer Plans_. Buyer will cause any employee benefit plans of
Buyer (or any Affiliate thereof sponsoring or maintaining such plans) in which
the Transferred Employees are entitled to participate from and after the
Closing Date (the " _Buyer Plans_ ") to take into account, for purposes of
eligibility and vesting thereunder (but not for purposes of benefit accrual),
service by the Transferred Employees with Sellers prior to the Closing as if
such service were with Buyer, to the same extent such service was credited
under a comparable Benefit Plan prior to the Closing (except to the extent it
would result in the duplication of benefits). In addition, with respect to
each Buyer Plan that is a "welfare benefit  



 

52  plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Buyer shall, or shall cause an
Affiliate of Buyer sponsoring or maintaining such Buyer Plan to (i) cause
there to be waived any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, insurability
requirements or other eligibility limitations and (ii) to the extent possible
under the terms of the provider agreements governing the Buyer Plans,
give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out of
pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, the Transferred Employees and their dependents under a
comparable Benefit Plan in any plan year ongoing as of the Closing Date.

(c) _WARN Act_. On the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide a list setting
forth the name and Facility of any and all Facility Employees who have
experienced an employment loss or layoff (as defined by the WARN Act) within
ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date (the " _WARN List_ "). For a period
of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not engage in any
conduct which would result in an employment loss or layoff for a sufficient
number of employees of Buyer at any Facility which, if aggregated with any
such conduct prior to the Closing Date, would trigger the WARN Act. In
satisfying its obligations under this _Section 8.4(c)_, Buyer shall take into
account and be entitled to rely upon the WARN List.

8.5 _Post-Closing Books and Records and Personnel_.

For five (5) years after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be
required by any Governmental Authority or ongoing claim), (a) Buyer shall not
dispose of or destroy any of the business records and files of the Business
received by Buyer as Acquired Assets and (b) Parent and Buyer shall allow
Sellers (including, for clarity, any trust established under a chapter 11 plan
of Sellers or any other successors of Sellers) and any of their directors,
officers, employees, counsel, representatives, accountants and auditors
reasonable access during normal business hours, at Sellers sole expense and
upon reasonable advance notice, to all employees and files of Parent and Buyer
and their respective Subsidiaries and any Documents included in the Acquired
Assets for purposes relating to the Bankruptcy Case, the wind-down of the
operations of Sellers, the functions of any such trusts or successors, or
other reasonable business purposes, and Sellers (including any such trust or
successors) and such directors, officers, employees, counsel, representatives,
accountants and auditors shall have the right to make copies of any such
files, books, records and other materials. Until the closing of the
Bankruptcy Case or the liquidation and winding up of Sellers estates, Sellers
shall preserve and keep the records retained by them relating to the Business
and the Acquired Assets and, at Buyers sole expense, shall make such records
and Sellers personnel available to Buyer as may be reasonably required by
Buyer in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by,
Proceedings, Actions or Tax audits against, or governmental
investigations of, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or in order to enable Buyer
to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document. In the event any Party desires to destroy any such records during or
after the time during which they must be maintained pursuant to this _Section
8.5_, such Party shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the
other Parties and any such other Parties shall have the right at their option
and expense, upon prior written notice given within such ninety (90) day
period to the Party desiring to destroy such records, to take possession of
the records within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of such
notice, or such shorter period as the liquidation and winding up of Sellers
estates shall permit.



 

53 8.6 _Parent Guarantee_.

Parent shall cause the performance of all of Buyers agreements, covenants and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (the "
_Buyer Obligations_ "). Parent hereby unconditionally, absolutely, continually
and irrevocably guarantees to each Seller and each Sellers respective
successors and assigns full and punctual performance, discharge
and/or payment, as applicable, of all of the Buyer Obligations (such
guarantee, the " _Parent Guarantee_ ") and shall be liable for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of Buyer under
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. The Parent Guarantee is a
guarantee of payment and performance and not merely collection. The Parent
Guarantee and the obligations of Parent under this _Section 8.6_ shall be
valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation,
impairment, discharge or termination for any reason, and the liability of
Parent under the Parent Guarantee is exclusive and independent of any other
guarantee of the Buyer Obligations, whether executed by Parent, by any other
guarantor or by any other Person. Without limitation as to the foregoing, no
amendment to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents,
including an amendment that amends, modifies, extends or accelerates the
time or manner of payment and/or performance of any of the Buyer Obligations
shall, with or without any notice to or consent of Parent, in any way
discharge, terminate, release, affect or impair the obligations of Parent
under the Parent Guarantee. With respect to the Parent Guarantee, Parent
waives (u) notice of the Buyer Obligations and the acceptance of the Parent
Guarantee by Sellers, (v) promptness, diligence, protest, presentment, demand
for payment, notice of default or non-payment, notice of dishonor, notice of
protest and all other notices of any kind, (w) all defenses based on Buyers
failure to duly authorize, execute or deliver this Agreement or any other
Transaction Documents, based on any claim as to unenforceability of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or based on any other occurrence
or state of facts that would cause any representation or warranty of Buyer
under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents not to be true
and correct, (x) any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations
under this _Section 8.6_ and the Parent Guarantee by reason of any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor-
relief proceeding and any right to require the marshalling of assets of
Buyer, (y) all defenses that may be available by virtue of any valuation,
stay, moratorium law or other Legal Requirement now or hereafter in effect,
and (z) all other defenses of a surety or guarantor to which it may be
entitled; provided, however, that, except for the defenses described in clause
(w) of this sentence, Parent shall be entitled to assert as a defense against
the Parent Guarantee with respect to any Buyer Obligation any defense that
Buyer would be entitled to assert with respect to such Buyer Obligation.
Without limitation as to the foregoing, the obligations of Parent under this
_Section 8.6_ and the liability of Parent under the Parent Guarantee shall
not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, terminated or affected by (i)
any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security
for any of the Buyer Obligations; (ii) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Buyer; (iii) any
claim, setoff, defense, or other right that Parent may have against any Seller
(other than pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents); (iv) any delay or failure by Sellers in the exercise
of their rights and remedies under this Agreement, including under this
_Section 8.6_, or any other Transaction Document; (v) any delay or failure of
Sellers to enforce this Agreement or any other Transaction Document against
Buyer or to obtain any judgment against Buyer or to pursue any action to
enforce any judgment against Buyer; (vi) any direction as to application of
payment by Buyer or by any other Person; (vii) any other continuing or other
 



 

54  guarantee, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other
Person as to any of the Buyer Obligations; (viii) any payment on or
in reduction of any such other guarantee or undertaking; (viii) any
termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by Buyer; (ix) any
change, reorganization or termination of the corporate or limited liability
company structure or existence of Parent or Buyer or any of their
Subsidiaries and to any corresponding restructuring of the Buyer Obligations;
or (x) any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor. Parent
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set
forth in this _Section 8.6_ are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits. Sellers shall not be obliged to exhaust their recourse against Buyer
or any guarantee or security that any Seller may hold before being entitled to
performance from Parent of the Buyer Obligations. Parents obligations under
the Parent Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until all Buyer
Obligations shall have been fully paid, performed, satisfied and discharged.
To the extent that Parent or Buyer shall make a payment with respect to
any Buyer Obligation, which payment is subsequently invalidated, is declared
to be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided and/or required to
be repaid to Parent, Buyer, a trustee, a receiver or any other Person,
including under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then, to the extent of such avoidance or repayment, the Buyer
Obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.
Parent shall not exercise any rights of subrogation that it may at any time
otherwise have as a result of the Parent Guarantee to the claims of Sellers
against Buyer or any other guarantor of any of the Buyer Obligations and any
contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or
indemnity from any such other guarantor which it may at any time otherwise
have as a result of the Parent Guarantee until such time as the Buyer
Obligations shall have been fully performed, satisfied and discharged. Parent
shall not exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which Sellers now
have or may hereafter have against any such other guarantor, any endorser or
any other guarantor of all or any part of the Buyer Obligations until such
time as the Buyer Obligations shall have been fully paid, performed, satisfied
and discharged. This _Section 8.6_ applies to any assignee of Buyer under
_Section 12.7_ as if references in this _Section 8.6_ to Buyer were to such
assignee (and, in the case of any such application of this _Section 8.6_, the
term Buyer Obligations means all of such assignees agreements, covenants and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents).

8.7 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

(a) Buyer and Parent acknowledge that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article 5_ and the certificate delivered to Buyer
pursuant to _Section 9.1_, neither Sellers nor any other Person on behalf of
Sellers makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect
to Sellers (including representations and warranties as to the condition of
the Acquired Assets) or with respect to any information provided by or on
behalf of Sellers to Buyer or Parent. Neither Sellers nor any other Person
will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to
Buyer, Parent or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer or
Parent, or use by Buyer or Parent, of any such information, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Buyer or Parent in any "data rooms," "data sites," confidential
information memoranda or management presentations in expectation of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.



 

55 (b) In connection with investigation by Buyer and Parent, Buyer and Parent
have received or may receive from Sellers certain projections, forward-
looking statements and other forecasts and certain business plan information.
Buyer and Parent acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that Buyer and Parent are familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer and
Parent are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and
that Buyer and Parent shall have no claim against anyone with respect thereto.
Accordingly, Buyer and Parent acknowledge that Sellers make no representation
or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans).

8.8 _Acquired Assets "AS IS"; Buyer s and Parents Acknowledgment Regarding
Same_.

Buyer and Parent agree, warrant, and represent that (a) Buyer is purchasing
the Acquired Assets on an "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" basis based solely on
Buyers own investigation of the Acquired Assets and the representations and
warranties of Sellers set forth in _Article 5_ and (b) neither Sellers nor any
real estate broker or other Representative of Sellers has made any
warranties, representations or guarantees, express, implied or statutory,
written or oral, respecting the Acquired Assets, any part of the Acquired
Assets, the financial performance of the Acquired Assets or the business
of Sellers, or the physical condition of the Acquired Assets other than the
representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in _Article 5_. Buyer and
Parent further acknowledge that the consideration for the Acquired Assets
specified in this Agreement has been agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer after
good-faith arms-length negotiation in light of Buyers agreement to purchase
the Acquired Assets "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" subject only to the
representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in _Article 5_. Buyer and
Parent agree, warrant and represent that, except as set forth in this
Agreement (including the representations and warranties of Sellers set forth
in _Article 5_ ), Buyer and Parent have relied, and shall rely, solely upon
Buyers and Parents own investigation of all such matters, and that Buyer and
Parent assume all risks with respect thereto. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS SET FORTH
IN _ARTICLE 5_ ), SELLERS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTY, NO WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, NO WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NO
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO ANY REAL OR PERSONAL
PROPERTY OR ANY FIXTURES OR THE ACQUIRED ASSETS.

8.9 _Waiver of Claims by Sellers_.

As a material inducement for Buyer and Parent to execute this Agreement,
Sellers hereby waive, release, relinquish and discharge all claims, demands,
and causes of action (including Avoidance Actions and similar rights and
causes of action, including causes of action  



 

56  under Section 544 through 553 of the Bankruptcy Code) that Sellers (or, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any of their Affiliates and any
other Persons claiming or having the right to claim by, through or under
Sellers or their Affiliates) have against any of the Buyer Parties, whether
absolute or contingent, known or unknown, now existing or hereafter arising;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Sellers do not hereby waive any claims,
demands, rights or causes of action arising under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.

8.10 _Casualty_.

If, prior to the Closing, all or any material portion of any Facility or any
material portion of the Acquired Assets is destroyed by fire or other
casualty, is taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain or
Proceedings for such purposes are pending, Buyer may elect, in Buyers sole
discretion, to:

(a) terminate this Agreement, whereupon no Party shall have any further
obligation to any other hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall
not be entitled to exercise this option unless Restoration Costs exceed
$25,000,000;

(b) eliminate some or all of the affected assets from the Acquired Assets to
be purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and reduce the consideration
payable by Buyer hereunder by an amount to be mutually agreed between Buyer
and Sellers; or

(c) purchase the Acquired Assets notwithstanding any such destruction, taking
or pending taking and reduce the consideration payable by Buyer hereunder in
an amount equal to the Restoration Costs.

" _Restoration Costs_ " means either (i) in the case of damage or destruction
by fire or casualty, the estimated cost to repair or replace the affected
assets or (ii) in the case of a taking or threatened taking, the greater of
(A) value of the assets taken or (B) the costs necessary to
restore substantially the same functional utility to the affected Facility
following the taking. The Restoration Costs shall be as mutually agreed by
Sellers and Buyer or, if they are unable to agree, then shall be as determined
by an engineering firm or appraisal firm mutually acceptable to Sellers and
Buyer.

As used in this _Section 8.10_, a "material portion" means any portion of a
Facility or any other Acquired Assets (i) the value of which equals or exceeds
$5,000,000, or (ii) which is necessary in order to continue to operate any
Facility or the Business in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice.

Sellers shall be entitled to retain all insurance proceeds, awards and other
amounts paid or payable to Sellers by any insurance companies, Governmental
Authorities or other third parties by reason of the destruction or taking of
the affected Acquired Assets.

     | (c) | by Sellers: 
---|---|--- 

(i) in the event of any breach by Buyer or Parent of any of Buyers or
Parents agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein
( _provided_ such breach would result in the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 10.1_ or  _Section 10.3_ to be satisfied) or (if such breach is
material) in the Bidding Procedures Order or Sale Order, and the failure of
Buyer or Parent to cure such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of the
Seller  



 

62  Termination Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers (A) are not
themselves in material breach of any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or in the Bidding
Procedures Order or the Sale Order, (B) notify Buyer in writing (the " _Seller
Termination Notice_ ") of their intention to exercise their rights under
this  _Section 11.1(c)(i)_ as a result of the breach, and (C) specify in the
Seller Termination Notice the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein or in the Bidding Procedures Order or Sale Order of which
Buyer or Parent is allegedly in breach;

(ii) if a Governmental Authority issues a final, non-appealable ruling or
Order prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby where such ruling or
Order was requested, encouraged or supported by Buyer or Parent; or

(iii) if Buyer is not the Successful Bidder at the Auction.

11.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Buyer or Sellers pursuant
to this _Article 11_, all rights and obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any other
Party, except for (i) Buyers liability to take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the Deposit Escrow Agent to make the disbursement required
by  _Section 11.2(b)_ if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
11.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 11.1(c)(ii)_, (ii) Sellers liability to pay the
Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement as required by  _Section
11.2(c)_ if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_,
_Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _Section 11.1(a)(v)_, _Section 11.1(a)(vi)_,
_Section 11.1(a)(vii)_,  _Section 11.1(b)(i)_, _Section 11.1(b)(ii)_,
_Section 11.1(b)(iii)_, _Section 11.1(b)(v)_, _Section 11.1(b)(vi)_ or
_Section 11.1(c)(iii) _and (iii) Sellers liability to take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the Deposit Escrow Agent to make the
disbursement required by _Section 11.2(d)_ if this Agreement is terminated
other than pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 11.1(c)(ii)_. The
provisions of _Section 7.6_ and this _Section 11.2_ (and, to the extent
applicable to the interpretation or enforcement of such provisions, _Article
1_ and _Article 12_ ), shall expressly survive the termination of this
Agreement.

(b) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(c)(i)_ or  _Section 11.1(c)(ii)_, Sellers shall be entitled to
disbursement of the Deposit no later than two (2) Business Days after the
effective date of such termination. The Parties expressly agree and
acknowledge that it would be extremely difficult or impracticable to
ascertain the actual damages that would be incurred by the Seller Parties in
the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)(i)_
or _Section 11.1(c)(ii)_ and that the Deposit represents the Parties
reasonable estimate of the damages that would be incurred by the Seller
Parties in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 11.1(c)(ii)_. Sellers right to receive the Deposit
pursuant to this _Section 11.2(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to the Seller Parties against the Buyer Parties with respect to this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby in the event that this Agreement is terminated in the
circumstances under which the Deposit is so payable, and no Buyer Party shall
have any further liability or obligation  



 

63  relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. If Sellers shall
be entitled to receive and do receive the Deposit in accordance herewith,
then Sellers agree that the Deposit shall be (i) full liquidated damages for
any and all failures to act, defaults or breaches hereunder by Buyer or
Parent, including any material or willful breach by Buyer or Parent, and (ii)
shall constitute a full release and discharge of all claims by the Seller
Parties for damages for such failures to act, defaults or breaches, and that
the Seller Parties shall not have any further cause of action for damages,
specific performance or any other legal or equitable relief against any Buyer
Party with respect thereto.

(c) (i) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(v)_, _Section 11.1(a)(vii)_, _Section 11.1(b)(i)_, _Section
11.1(b)(ii)_, _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_,  _Section 11.1(b)(v) _or _Section
11.1(c)(iii)_, Sellers shall pay to Buyer the Break-Up Fee plus the Expense
Reimbursement within two (2) Business Days following such termination, (ii) in
the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(vi)_, Sellers shall pay to Buyer the Expense Reimbursement (but not
the Break-Up Fee) within two (2) Business Days following such termination and
(iii) in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(ii)_, _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_ or _Section 11.1(b)(vi)_, (A) Sellers
shall pay to Buyer the Expense Reimbursement within two (2) Business Days
following such termination and (B) if, prior to such termination, a proposal
or offer is made in respect of an Alternative Transaction, which proposal or
offer has not been withdrawn prior to such termination, and within six (6)
months following such termination Sellers enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Alternative Transaction or such Alternative Transaction
is consummated, Sellers shall cause to be paid to Buyer the Break-Up Fee
within two (2) Business Days following such event; _provided_ that under no
circumstances shall Sellers be obligated to pay the Break-Up Fee or Expense
Reimbursement more than once; and _provided further_ that, if Sellers fail to
pay any amounts due to Buyer pursuant to this  _Section 11.2(c)_ within the
time period specified herein, Sellers shall pay the costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Buyer in connection
with any Action or Proceeding taken to collect payment of such amounts,
together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the Applicable Rate,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment. The Parties expressly agree and
acknowledge that it would be extremely difficult or impracticable to
ascertain the actual damages that would be incurred by the Buyer Parties in
the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(ii)_, _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_,  _Section 11.1(a)(v)_, _Section
11.1(a)(vi)_, _Section 11.1(a)(vii)_, _Section 11.1(b)(i)_, _Section
11.1(b)(ii)_, _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_, _Section 11.1(b)(v)_,  _Section
11.1(b)(vi)_ or _Section 11.1(c)(iii) _and that the return of the Deposit,
and the payment of the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement, as
applicable, to Buyer (such aggregate amounts returned or paid to Buyer, for
purposes of this _Section 11.2(c)_, the " _Liquidated Damages Amount_ "),
represents the Parties reasonable estimate of the damages that would be
incurred by the Buyer Parties in the event of a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_, _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _Section
11.1(a)(v)_, _Section 11.1(a)(vi)_, _Section 11.1(a)(vii)_, _Section
11.1(b)(i)_,  _Section 11.1(b)(ii)_, _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_, _Section
11.1(b)(v)_, _Section 11.1(b)(vi)_ or _Section 11.1(c)(iii)_. Buyers right
to receive the Liquidated Damages Amount in the circumstances in which it is
payable to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 11.2(c)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to the Buyer Parties against the Seller Parties
with respect to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in the event that this
Agreement is terminated in the circumstances in which the  



 

64  Liquidated Damages Amount is so payable, and no Seller Party shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. If Buyer shall be entitled to receive and does receive the Liquidated
Damages Amount in accordance herewith, then Buyer and Parent agree that such
Liquidated Damages Amount shall be (i) full liquidated damages for any and
all failures to act, defaults or breaches hereunder by Sellers, including any
material or willful breach by Sellers, and (ii) shall constitute a full
release and discharge of all claims by the Buyer Parties for damages for such
failures to act, defaults or breaches, and that the Buyer Parties shall not
have any further cause of action for damages, specific performance or any
other legal or equitable relief against any Seller Party with respect
thereto.

(d) In the event of a termination of this Agreement other than pursuant to
_Section 11.1(c)(i)_ or  _Section 11.1(c)(ii)_, Buyer shall be entitled to
disbursement of the Deposit, no later than two (2) Business Days after the
effective date of such termination.

(e) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
11.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that without these agreements such Party would not have
entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Section 11.2_ do not constitute a penalty.

ARTICLE 12

_G ENERAL PROVISIONS_

12.1 _Survival_.

All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms are to be
performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions, subsequent to
the Closing shall, solely to the extent such covenants and agreements are to
be performed, or prohibit actions, subsequent to the Closing, survive the
Closing in accordance with their terms. All other covenants and agreements
contained herein, and all representations and warranties contained herein or
in any certificated deliveries hereunder, shall not survive the Closing and
shall thereupon terminate, including any Actions for damages in respect of any
breach thereof.

The Parties agree that the confidentiality agreements entered into by them
and their Affiliates, dated November 28, 2008, shall continue in full force
and effect notwithstanding the execution and delivery by the Parties of this

become a matter of public record as a result of the Bankruptcy Case and the
Filings related thereto shall not constitute a breach of such confidentiality
agreements, and (b) disclosures permitted under this Agreement shall not
constitute a breach of such confidentiality agreements.

Unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement or by obligations of
Buyer or Sellers or their respective Affiliates pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of  



 

65  any securities exchange, Buyer and Parent, on the one hand, and Sellers, on

12.5  _Waiver_.

Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power,
or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no
single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege shall
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or
the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, (a) no waiver that may be given by a Party shall
be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given, and (b)

This Agreement (including the Schedules and the Exhibits) and the other
Transaction Documents supersede all prior agreements between Parent and/or
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, with respect to its
subject matter and constitute a complete and exclusive statement of the terms
of the agreements between Parent and/or Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers,
on the other hand, with respect to their subject matter. This Agreement may
not be amended except by a written agreement executed by all of the Parties.

12.7 _Assignment_.

in the sole discretion of such other Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall be permitted, upon prior notice to Sellers, to assign all or
part of its rights or obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates,
but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer or Parent of its obligations under
this Agreement.



 

67 12.8 _Severability_.

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability. 

12.9 _Expenses_.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, including _Section
11.2_, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, the Parties shall bear their own respective expenses (including
all compensation and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, consultants,
actuaries and independent accountants) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

12. _10 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue; Jury Trial Waiver_. 

(a) Except to the extent the mandatory provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
apply, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to
be performed entirely in such state without regard to principles of conflicts
or choice of laws or any other law that would make the laws of any other
jurisdiction other than the State of New York applicable hereto.

(b) Without limitation of any Partys right to appeal any Order of the
Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims
or disputes which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this
Agreement, any breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) any and all claims relating to the foregoing shall be filed
and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the Parties hereby consent
and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court
and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any such Action or Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the
Bankruptcy Case is closed, all Actions and Proceedings arising out of
or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in a New York
state court or a federal court sitting in the state of New York, and the
Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
such courts in any such Action or Proceeding and irrevocably waive the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Action or
Proceeding. The Parties consent to service of process by mail (in accordance
with _Section 12.4_) or any other manner permitted by law.

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
SELLERS, BUYER OR PARENT OR THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE
NEGOTIATION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF.



 

68 12.11 _Counterparts_.

This Agreement and any amendment hereto may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original of this
Agreement or such amendment and all of which, when taken together, shall
be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in _Section 12.4_, delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement or any amendment hereto by telecopier,
facsimile or email attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement or such amendment, as applicable.

12.12 _Parties in Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns, and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any legal or equitable benefit, claim, cause of action, remedy or
right of any kind.

12.13 _Non-Recourse_.

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner or equityholder of Buyer, Parent or any Seller shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of such Party under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

12.14 _Schedules; Materiality_.

The inclusion of any matter in any Schedule shall be deemed to be an
inclusion for all purposes of this Agreement, to the extent that such
disclosure is sufficient to identify the Section to which such disclosure is
responsive, but inclusion therein shall not be deemed to constitute an
admission, or otherwise imply, that any such matter is material or creates a
measure for materiality for purposes of this Agreement. The disclosure of any
particular fact or item in any Schedule shall not be deemed an admission as
to whether the fact or item is "material" or would constitute a "Material
Adverse Effect."

12.15 _Specific Performance for Post-Closing Covenants_.

Solely with respect to the Parties respective covenants under this Agreement
that survive the Closing, and solely to the extent to be performed after the
Closing, (a) each Party recognizes that if such Party breaches or refuses to
perform any such covenant, monetary damages alone would not be adequate
to compensate the non-breaching Party or Parties for their injuries, (b) the
non-breaching Party or Parties shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any
other remedies that may be available, to obtain specific performance of the
terms of such covenants, (c) if any Action or Proceeding is brought by the
non-breaching Party or Parties to enforce such covenants, the Party in breach
shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law, (d) 



 

69  each Party agrees to waive any requirement for the security or posting of
any bond in connection with any Action or Proceeding seeking specific
performance of such covenants and (e) each Party agrees that the only
permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for specific
performance of such covenants is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of such covenants. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, no Party shall be entitled to any equitable
remedy, including an injunction or order for specific performance, to enforce
any provision of this Agreement prior to the Closing.

12.16 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy for Breach_.

(a) In the event of any breach prior to the Closing by Buyer or Parent of any
of Buyers or Parents agreements, representations or warranties contained
herein or in the Bidding Procedures Order or Sale Order, including any breach
that is material or willful, Sellers sole and exclusive remedy shall be to
exercise its rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(c)_, in accordance with the terms of such  _Section 11.1(c)_, and to
receive the disbursement of the Deposit as liquidated damages as provided in
_Section 11.2(b)_, and the Seller Parties shall not have any further cause of
action for damages, specific performance or any other legal or equitable
relief against any Buyer Party with respect thereto.

(b) In the event of any breach prior to the Closing by any Seller of any of
Sellers agreements, representations or warranties contained herein or in the
Bidding Procedures Order or Sale Order, including any breach that is material
or willful, Buyers and Parents sole and exclusive remedy shall be to
exercise Buyers rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(b)_, in accordance with the terms of such _Section 11.1(b)_, and to
receive payment of the Liquidated Damages Amount as liquidated damages as
provided in _Section 11.2(c)_, and the Buyer Parties shall not have any
further cause of action for damages, specific performance or any other legal
or equitable relief against any Seller Party with respect thereto.

 

12.17 _No Special Damages_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no Party
shall be liable to or otherwise responsible to any other Party or any other
Person for exemplary, punitive, consequential, indirect, incidental or other
special damages (including loss of revenue, income or profits or loss in
value of assets or securities) for any matter arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, regardless of how caused and regardless of
the theory of recovery.
