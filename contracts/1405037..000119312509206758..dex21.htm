vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

This Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of October 9, 2009 by and among Chaparral Energy, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Chaparral"), United Refining Energy Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and Chaparral Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"). Parent, Merger Sub and
Chaparral are sometimes referred to herein individually as a "Party" and
collectively as the "Parties."

WITNESSETH:

A. Parent, Chaparral and Merger Sub intend to effect the merger of Merger Sub
with and into Chaparral (the "Merger"), with Chaparral continuing as the
surviving entity following the Merger, as a result of which all of the issued
and outstanding common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Chaparral (the
"Chaparral Common Stock"), will automatically be exchanged into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (as defined herein) upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance
with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), as amended.

B. The Board of Directors of Chaparral and the Boards of Directors of each of
Parent and Merger Sub have unanimously approved this Agreement and the Merger
and each of them have determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the respective
best interests of Chaparral, Parent and Merger Sub.

C. The Chaparral Stockholders (as defined herein) have approved and adopted
this Agreement and the Merger, and the Board of Directors of Parent has
resolved to recommend that its stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement
and the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereto agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

_TERMS OF THE MERGER_

1.1 _The Merger_.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined herein), Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into Chaparral. Upon consummation of the Merger,
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and Chaparral, as
the surviving company in the Merger (the "Surviving Company"), shall continue
its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent.

1.2 _The Closing; Effective Time; Effect_.

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
Section 7.1, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI hereof, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Ellenoff Grossman and Schole LLP at 10:00 a.m. New
York City time no later than the second Business Day after the date that all
of the closing conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or
waived, unless 



 

1  another time, date or place is agreed upon in writing by the Parties hereto.
The date on which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing
Date."

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, concurrently with the Closing,
the Parties shall file with the Secretary of State of Delaware (the "DE
Secretary of State") a certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL
substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (referred to herein
as the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such other time
as is agreed by the Parties hereto, in accordance with the DGCL and as
specified in the Certificate of Merger. The time when the Merger shall become
effective is herein referred to as the "Effective Time." The Certificate of
Merger shall change the name of the Surviving Company to Chaparral Subsidiary,
Inc.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall possess
all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Chaparral and
Merger Sub, and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties
of Chaparral and Merger Sub shall become the claims, obligations,
liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving Company.

1.3 _Exchange of Securities_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Chaparral or the holders of any securities of Chaparral, all of
the Chaparral Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive an
aggregate of sixty three million (63,000,000) shares of common stock (the
"Stock Consideration") of Parent, par value $0.0001 per share ("Parent Common
Stock"). At the Closing, (i) fifty eight million (58,000,000) shares of the
Stock Consideration shall be distributed to the stockholders of Chaparral of
record immediately prior to the Closing (individually, a "Chaparral
Stockholder" and collectively, the "Chaparral Stockholders") in
accordance with the allocation set forth on _Exhibit B_ attached hereto, and
(ii) five million (5,000,000) shares of the Stock Consideration (the "Escrow
Shares") shall be escrowed to cover any indemnification claims of
Parent against Chaparral pursuant to Section 5.3 of this Agreement and such
Escrow Shares shall be subject to forfeiture and cancellation in the event the
Escrow Shares are not earned pursuant to Section 1.4(a)(i) of this Agreement.

 

(b) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of Merger Sub shall be exchanged into one (1) issued and outstanding
share of common stock of the Surviving Company, and all such Surviving Company
common stock shall constitute the only outstanding common stock and common
stock equivalents of the Surviving Company following the Effective Time. From
and after the Effective Time, any certificate representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent common stock of the
Surviving Company into which such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
represented thereby were exchanged in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

(c) All Chaparral Common Stock shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Chaparral Stockholders, be automatically cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and each Chaparral Stockholder shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Stock
Consideration and the Earn-Out Shares (as defined in Section 1.4 below). The
Stock Consideration and Earn-Out Shares are referred to collectively herein as
the "Merger Consideration".

(d) Each Chaparral Stockholder shall enter into a "lock-up"
agreement substantially in the form set forth on _Exhibit C_ attached hereto
(a "Lock Up Agreement") pursuant to which such Chaparral Stockholder shall
agree, for a period of one year from the Closing Date, that such
Chaparral Stockholder shall neither, on his, her or its own behalf or on
behalf of entities, family members or trusts affiliated with or controlled by
him, her or it, offer, issue, grant any option on, sell or otherwise dispose
of any portion of the Stock Consideration issued to such Chaparral
Stockholder.



 

2 1.4 _Earn-Out Shares_. In addition to the Stock Consideration, Chaparral
Stockholders shall be entitled to up to an additional: (1) fifteen million
(15,000,000) shares of Parent Common Stock, which includes the Escrow Shares
(the "Share Price Earn-Out Shares"), and (2) five million (5,000,000) shares
of Parent Common Stock (the "EBITDA Earn-Out Shares" and together with the
Share Price Earn-Out Shares, the "Earn-Out Shares") in the event Parent
achieves certain earn-out triggers, defined in terms of a combination of
criteria as follows:

(a) _Share Price Earn-Out Shares_. The following table ("Table X") sets forth

(i) If Criterion A and B in Table X are met at any time during the period
from the Closing through December 31, 2010, the Chaparral Stockholders shall
be vested in the Escrow Shares, which will be distributed to the Chaparral
Stockholders in accordance with the allocation set forth on _Exhibit B,_
unless such shares otherwise remain subject to escrow pursuant to Section 5.3
hereof and the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement (defined in
Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement).

(ii) If Criterion A and C in Table X are met at any time during the period
from the Closing through December 31, 2011, Parent shall issue to the
Chaparral Stockholders an aggregate of ten million (10,000,000) shares of
Parent Common Stock as Share Price Earn-Out Shares, _less_ any Share Price
Earn-Out Shares issued pursuant to subsection 1.4(a)(i) above. 

(iii) If Criterion A and D in Table X are met at any time during the period
from the Closing through December 31, 2012, Parent shall issue to the
Chaparral Stockholders an aggregate of fifteen million (15,000,000) shares of
Parent Common Stock as Share Price Earn-Out Shares, _less_ any Share Price
Earn-Out Shares issued pursuant to subsections 1.4(a)(i) and (ii) above.

(b) _EBITDA Earn-Out Shares_. In the event (1) Criterion A on Table X above
is met and (2) Parents EBITDA for any fiscal year from 2010 through 2014,
based on the information shown on Parents audited financial statements filed
on Form 10-K (or equivalent form) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"), is in excess of six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000),
Parent shall issue to the Chaparral Stockholders an aggregate of five million
(5,000,000) shares of Parent Common Stock as EBITDA Earn-Out Shares. For
purposes of clarification, the EBITDA Earn-Out Shares may only be earned once,
without regard to whether the criteria set forth in this Section 1.4(b) is
achieved in any fiscal year following issuance of the EBITDA Earn-Out Shares
for the initial fiscal year in which they were earned. For purposes of this
Agreement, "EBITDA" of Parent shall be calculated in the same manner as the
calculation of "Consolidated EBITDAX" for Chaparral under its Fifth Amendment
to Seventh Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 21, 2009, by and among
Chaparral, Chaparral Energy, L.L.C., as Borrower Representative for the
Borrowers, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the
Lender parties thereto 



 

3  (the "Chaparral Credit Agreement"); _provided however_ , that cash proceeds
received from the termination or other monetization of any Swap Agreement (as
defined in the Chaparral Credit Agreement) shall not reduce Consolidated Net
Income (as defined in the Chaparral Credit Agreement).

(c) The Earn-Out Shares shall be distributed to the Chaparral Stockholders in
accordance with the allocation set forth on _Exhibit B_ attached hereto within
a reasonable period following achievement of the applicable criteria and,
if applicable, the provisions of Section 5.3 of this Agreement.

(d) The Lock Up Agreement for each Chaparral Stockholder shall also provide
that for a period of six (6) months from the date of issuance of any Earn-Out
Shares, such Chaparral Stockholder shall neither, on his, her or its own
behalf or on behalf of entities, family members or trusts affiliated with or
controlled by him, her or it, offer, issue, grant any option on, sell or
otherwise dispose of any portion of the Earn-Out Shares then-issued to such
Chaparral Stockholder.

(e) Any contingent stock payment hereunder shall be treated as comprised of
two components, respectively a principal component and an interest component,
the amounts of which shall be determined as provided in Treas. Reg. Section
1.483-4(b) example (2) using the 3-month test rate of interest provided for in
Treas. Reg. Section 1.1274-4(a)(1)(ii) employing the semi-annual compounding
period. As to each such contingent stock payment to each former Chaparral
Stockholder, shares representing the principal component (with a value equal
to the principal component) and shares representing the interest component
(with a value equal to the interest component) shall be represented by
separate share certificates.

1.5  _Sponsor Earn-Out Shares_. At the Effective Time, the terms of the
Securities Escrow Agreement dated December 11, 2007 (the "Securities Escrow
Agreement") by and among Parent, United Refining, Inc. (the "Sponsor") and
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust company, as escrow agent (the "Escrow
Agent") shall be amended and restated to provide that 5,625,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock owned by the Sponsor and currently escrowed pursuant to
the Securities Escrow Agreement will be subject to forfeiture and cancellation
in the event none or only a portion of the Earn-Out Shares are released from
escrow (the "Sponsor Earn-Out Shares"). The amendment to the Securities
Escrow Agreement (the "Securities Escrow Agreement Amendment") shall provide
that the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares will be released from escrow to the Sponsor
in four equal tranches; each tranche to be released when the Chaparral
Stockholders are entitled to receive 5,000,000 shares of the Share Price Earn-
Out Shares and/or the EBITDA Earn-Out Shares. The Securities Escrow Agreement
Amendment shall provide that it is a condition to the release from escrow of
any Sponsor Earn-Out Shares that the Sponsor enter into a Lock Up Agreement
pursuant to which the Sponsor shall agree, for a period of six months from the
date of release of such shares from escrow, that the Sponsor shall not on
its own behalf or on behalf of entities, Persons or trusts affiliated with or
controlled by it, offer, issue, grant any option on, sell or otherwise dispose
of any portion of the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares then-released to the Sponsor.

1.6 _Tender and Payment_.

(a) _Surrender of Certificates_. Upon surrender of stock certificates
representing the shares of Chaparral Common Stock (the "Chaparral Stock
Certificates") (accompanied by duly executed stock powers) at the Closing as
well as the delivery to Parent of a letter of transmittal which shall include
customary representations and warranties including, but not limited to, the
Chaparral Stockholders right, title and interest in their Chaparral Common
Stock, their acceptance of the terms and conditions of the proposed
transaction, and acknowledgement by the Chaparral Stockholders that any and
all rights, preferences, privileges and obligations owed by Chaparral to
the Chaparral Stockholders, shall cease and be of no further force or effect,
the Chaparral Stockholders holding such Chaparral Stock Certificates shall
receive in exchange therefore stock certificates representing the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Chaparral Common
Stock are converted at the Effective Time, and such Chaparral Stock
Certificates shall be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Chaparral
Stock Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
evidence only the right to receive the applicable number of shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the allocation set forth on _Exhibit B_. If payment
of the Stock Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Chaparral Common Stock 



 

4  is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the letter of
transmittal be in proper form for such transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the Chaparral
Common Stock, or such Person shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. 

(b) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be
issued upon the surrender of the Chaparral Common Stock for exchange. Each
Chaparral Stockholder who receives any portion of the Stock Consideration
payable in Parent Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall have such
fractional share rounded up to the nearest whole number.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Chaparral Common
Stock_. At the Effective Time, the transfer books of Chaparral shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Chaparral Common Stock on the records of Chaparral. From and after the
Effective Time, the Chaparral Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and they shall cease to have any
rights, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.

(d) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from
the Merger Consideration payable to a Chaparral Stockholder any such amounts
as are required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent such amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving Company, or
caused to be withheld by the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Chaparral Stockholders in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

1.7 _Certificate of Incorporation and Governing Documents_. At and after the
Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, and until the same have been duly
amended, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Chaparral, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company. 

1.8 _Directors and Officers_.

Parent shall be the directors set forth in the Proxy Statement, which are
selected pursuant to the methodology set forth in _Section 5.8_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedules.

1.9 _Certain Adjustments to Parent Capitalization_.

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
Parent Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or different
class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-
up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable
in any other securities occurs or is declared with a record date within such
period, or any similar event occurs, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the Chaparral Stockholders the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

1.10 _Other Effects of the Merger_.

The Merger shall have all further effects as specified in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.



 

5 1.11 _Additional Actions_.

If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Company or Parent its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of Merger Sub or Chaparral or otherwise carry
out this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of Merger Sub or Chaparral, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
Merger Sub or Chaparral, all such other actions and things as may be necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

1.12 _Tax-Free Reorganization_.

are intended to be a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the
Code and for the purpose of qualifying the Merger and the Short-Form Merger,
collectively, as a Tax-free transaction for federal income Tax purposes. The
Parties agree to report the Merger and the Short-Form Merger, collectively,
as a Tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a). None of
the Parties will take or cause to be taken any action which would prevent the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a).

ARTICLE II

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CHAPARRAL_

The following representations and warranties by Chaparral to Parent and Merger
Sub are qualified by the Chaparral disclosure schedules, which set forth
certain disclosures concerning Chaparral and its subsidiaries (each a
"Subsidiary" and collectively, the "Subsidiaries") and each of their divisions
and businesses (the "Chaparral Disclosure Schedules"). Except as disclosed in
the Chaparral Disclosure Schedules, Chaparral hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

2.1 _Due Organization and Good Standing_. Each of Chaparral and the
Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its respective business as now being
conducted. Each of Chaparral and the Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the character of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Chaparral has heretofore made available to Parent accurate and
complete copies of Chaparrals and each Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation, formation or organization, bylaws, membership agreements or
other organizational documents, each as currently in effect. None of Chaparral
or any Subsidiary is in violation of any provision of its certificate of
incorporation, formation or organization, stockholder agreements, bylaws,
membership agreements, partnership agreements or other organizational
documents.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall
mean, with respect to a Party, any occurrence, state of facts, change, event,
effect or circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, has, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the assets,
liabilities, business, results of 



 

6  operations or financial condition of such Party and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or to otherwise carry on its business as now being conducted and
as proposed to be conducted following the Effective Time, except, in each
case, for any such effect attributable to (i) changes in laws, regulations or
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), or
interpretations thereof, (ii) the announcement or pendency of this Agreement,
any actions taken in compliance with this Agreement or the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), or
(iii) the failure of a Party or any of its subsidiaries to take any action
referred to in Sections 4.1 or 4.6, as the case may be, due to another Partys
unreasonable withholding, delaying or conditioning of its consent. For
purposes of determining whether a particular change, event, circumstance or
effect has a "Material Adverse Effect," the nature and effect of each change,
event, circumstance or effect shall be considered alone and together and along
with the detrimental impact on the properties, financial condition, business
operations, prospects or results of operations of a Party and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, of such change, event, circumstance or effect.

2.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Chaparral consists of (i) 3,000,000
shares of Chaparral Common Stock and (ii) 600,000 shares of preferred stock,

Common Stock is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-

outstanding securities of Chaparral has been issued in violation of any
foreign, federal or state securities Laws.

(b) There are no: (i) outstanding options, warrants, puts, calls, convertible
securities, preemptive or similar rights, (ii) bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness having general voting rights or that are convertible or
exchangeable into securities having such rights, or (iii) subscriptions or
other rights, agreements, arrangements, contracts or commitments of any
character, relating to the issued or unissued Chaparral Common Stock or equity
or partnership interest in any Subsidiary or obligating Chaparral or any
Subsidiary to issue, transfer, deliver or sell or cause to be
issued, transferred, delivered, sold or repurchased any options or Chaparral
Common Stock of, or other equity interest in, Chaparral or any Subsidiary, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests, or obligating Chaparral or any Subsidiary to grant, extend or
enter into any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other right,
agreement, arrangement or commitment for such equity interests. There are no
outstanding obligations of Chaparral or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any Chaparral Common Stock or other equity interest in,
Chaparral or any Subsidiary to provide funds to make any investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any other entity.

(c) There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which Chaparral or any Subsidiary is a party with respect

similar instrument, (C) all obligations under financing leases, (D) all
obligations under conditional sale or other title retention agreements
relating to property purchased by Chaparral, (E) all obligations under leases
required to be accounted for as capital leases under GAAP, (F) all obligations
in respect of acceptances issued or created, (G) all liabilities secured by
an 



 

7  Encumbrance on any property and (H) all guarantee obligations. As used in
this Agreement, "Expenses" means all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, reserve engineers, financing sources, experts and
consultants to a Party and its affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its
behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, the preparation,
printing, filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of the
Required Parent Vote (as defined in Section 3.4) and all other matters related
to the consummation of the Merger.

2.3 _Subsidiaries_.

_Section 2.3(a)_ of the Chaparral Disclosure Schedules sets forth, a true,
complete and correct list of all Subsidiaries, the authorized shares of each
Subsidiary, the issued and outstanding shares or membership interests of each
Subsidiary, their respective jurisdictions of organization and all
jurisdictions in which each Subsidiary is qualified to conduct business. All
of the capital stock and other equity interests of the Subsidiaries are owned,
directly or indirectly, by Chaparral free and clear of any Encumbrance with
respect thereto. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interests in each of the Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are free of preemptive rights and
were issued in compliance with applicable Laws (as defined in Section 2.6).
No capital stock or other equity interests of any of any of the Subsidiaries
are or may become required to be issued or purchased by reason of any options,
warrants, rights to subscribe to, puts, calls or commitments of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or
exchangeable for, shares of any capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, any Subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which any Subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares of
its capital stock or other equity interests, or options, warrants or rights to
purchase or acquire any additional shares of its capital stock or other equity
interests or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
interests. Neither Chaparral nor any Subsidiary owns any shares of capital
stock or other equity or voting interests in (including any securities
exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into capital stock or other
equity or voting interests in) any other Person other than publicly traded
securities constituting less than five percent of the outstanding equity of
the issuing entity, other than capital stock or other equity interest of the
Subsidiaries owned by Chaparral or another Subsidiary.

corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to

discretion of the court from which such relief may be sought (collectively,

claims, mortgages, pledges, security interests, equities, options,
assignments, hypothecations, preferences, priorities, deposit arrangements,
easements, proxies, voting trusts or charges of any kind or restrictions

would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

2.7 _Chaparral Financial Statements_.

(a) As used herein, the term "Chaparral Financials" means (x) Chaparrals
audited consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes thereto), consisting, in part, of Chaparrals balance sheets as

statements of cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
and (y) the unaudited interim financial statements of Chaparral for the six
month period ended June 30, 2009 and for the three months and nine

in stockholders equity, and cash flow of Chaparral and the Subsidiaries as at
the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial
statements, all in accordance with (i) GAAP and (ii) Regulation S-X. As of
January 1, 2008, neither Chaparral nor any Subsidiary had any off-balance

inclusion in the Proxy Statement, comply in all material respects with the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), Regulation
S-X and the published general rules and regulations of the SEC.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any

9 (b) For the year ended December 31, 2008 and the quarters ended March 31,
2009 and June 30, 2009, Chaparral has had no (i) significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of Chaparrals internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Chaparrals ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Chaparrals internal
controls over financial reporting.

(c) Chaparral and each Subsidiary has not and, to the knowledge of Chaparral,
no auditor or accountant of Chaparral or any Subsidiary or any manager,
director, officer or consultant of Chaparral or any Subsidiary, has received
any material written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Chaparral or any Subsidiary or their internal accounting controls, including
any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Chaparral or any Subsidiary
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No attorney
representing Chaparral or any Subsidiary has reported evidence of any
violation of consumer protection (including rules and regulations promulgated
by any state or federal Governmental Authority or with jurisdiction,
oversight or regulatory control over the conduct of the business of Chaparral
or its Subsidiaries) or securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Chaparral or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees or agents to the Board of Directors,

Intellectual Property, other than Off-the-Shelf Software Agreements, licensed,

has: (i) all right, title and interest in and to all Chaparral Intellectual
Property owned by it, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted

respect to any such Chaparral Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by
the IRS, United States Department of Labor (the "DOL") or other Governmental

IRS or the DOL.



 

15 (i) All employees, managers, directors, and consultants are
appropriately classified as such under applicable Law in all material

Real Property"). The list set forth in _Section 2.19(a)-1_ of the Chaparral
Disclosure Schedules contains, with respect to each parcel of the Owned Real
Property, a description of all existing leases, licenses or other occupancy
contracts to which Chaparral or any Subsidiary is a party or by which
Chaparral or any Subsidiary is bound as a landlord, including all amendments,
modifications, extensions, 



 

17  renewals and supplements thereto (collectively, the "Landlord Leases"), the
terms of which have been complied with by Chaparral or such Subsidiary in all
material respects. The list set forth in _Section 2.19(a)-2_ of the
Chaparral Disclosure Schedules contains, with respect to each parcel of the

licenses or other occupancy contracts to which Chaparral or any Subsidiary is
a party or by which Chaparral or any Subsidiary is bound as a tenant,
including all amendments, modifications, extensions, assignments, subleases,
renewals and supplements thereto (collectively, the "Tenant Leases") (the
Landlord Leases and the Tenant Leases are herein sometimes collectively called
the "Leases"), the terms of which have been complied with by Chaparral and
such Subsidiary in all material respects. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, Chaparral and the Subsidiaries
have good, valid and marketable title to all of the Owned Real Property and
related personal property, assets and rights, free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of this
Agreement, when used with respect to Company Real Property, the term
"Permitted Encumbrances" means: (i) Encumbrances with respect to Taxes either
not yet due or being contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings or for

encroachments and other matters affecting title which are shown as exceptions
on the title insurance policies and/or title insurance commitments or reports
which have been made available to Parent; (iv) the terms and conditions of the
Tenant Leases; (v) applicable federal, State, local or tribal authority
building and land use regulations, restrictions or requirements, (vi)

(b) A correct and complete copy of each Lease has been furnished to Parent
prior to the date hereof. Chaparral or a Subsidiary, if applicable, has a
valid, binding and enforceable leasehold interest under each of the Tenant
Leases and each of the Leases is in full force and effect (except as such
enforcement may by limited by the Enforceability Exceptions or where the loss
of such Lease would not have a Material Adverse Effect) and to the extent
permitted under the terms of each Lease, grants Chaparral or a Subsidiary the
concurrent right to use and occupy the premises leased thereby. Neither
Chaparral nor any Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of Chaparral, any other
party to any Lease is in breach of or in default under, in any material
respect, any of the Leases, except to the extent any such breach would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Chaparral and the Subsidiaries enjoy peaceful
and undisturbed possession under all Tenant Leases, have not received notice
of any material default, delinquency or breach on the part of any party under
any Lease, and there are no existing material defaults (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) by Chaparral or any Subsidiary or, to the
knowledge of Chaparral, any other party thereto. No Consent under any Lease is
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except
where the failure to obtain such Consent would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, neither Chaparral nor any Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of
Chaparral, any other party to any Landlord Lease, is in breach of or in
default under any of the Landlord Leases.

affecting or relating to the Owned Real Property have heretofore been
furnished to Parent.

(e) There is no action, suit, litigation, hearing or administrative proceeding
pending or, to Chaparrals knowledge, threatened against Chaparral or any
Subsidiary or any partnership in which Chaparral or any Subsidiary owns
an interest, with respect to all or any portion of the Chaparral Real
Property, in each case which is not or would not be fully covered by
insurance, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(f) There are no condemnation or eminent domain proceedings pending, or to
Chaparrals knowledge, threatened against any Owned Real Property and, to
Chaparrals knowledge, there are no condemnation or eminent domain proceedings
pending or threatened against any Leased Real Property.

  

 

18 (g) Neither Chaparral nor any Subsidiary has granted any Person a
purchase option, right of first refusal, right of first offer or other right
to purchase any Owned Real Property.

(h) Neither Chaparral nor any Subsidiary has sent to any holder of any
mortgage or other interest (secured or unsecured) in any Chaparral Real
Property, nor has Chaparral or any Subsidiary received from any such holder, a
notice of default under any financing, loan or other document or security
agreement with respect to any Chaparral Real Property.

(i) There are no finders fees, brokerage commissions or tenant improvement
allowances outstanding with respect to any Chaparral Real Property.

(j) There are no Tax certiorari or Tax appeal proceedings outstanding with
respect to any Owned Real Property as of the date hereof.

(k) Neither Chaparral nor any Subsidiary has assigned its interest as lessor
or lessee under any Lease, other than to Chaparral or a Subsidiary or
collateral assignments in connection with any existing financing of any
Chaparral Real Property.

(l) Chaparral and each Subsidiary have insurable and marketable title to all
Owned Real Property subject to Permitted Encumbrances. Neither Chaparral nor
any Subsidiary has received notice of, or other writing referring to, any
requirements or recommendations by any insurance company that has issued a
policy covering any part of the Chaparral Real Property or by any board of
fire underwriters or other body exercising similar functions, requiring or
recommending any repairs or work to be done on any part of the Chaparral Real
Property, which repair or work has not been completed.

(m) Chaparral has no knowledge of any proceeding pending for the adjustment of
the assessed valuation of all or any portion of any Chaparral Real Property or
abatement with respect to all or any portion of the real estate taxes payable
on any Chaparral Real Property.

(n) The use and operation of the Chaparral Real Property in the conduct of
the business of Chaparral and its Subsidiaries does not violate any instrument
of record or agreement affecting such Owned Real Property, except for such
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Valid policies of title insurance
have been issued insuring all fee simple title to the Owned Real Property,
except where the failure of such policies to be in full force and effect would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and such
policies are in full force and effect. No material claim has been made against
any such policy.

to be drilled at locations to which proved undeveloped reserves are
attributable in the Reserve Reports, collectively the "Wells"). Chaparral or a
Subsidiary has satisfactory title to all other Oil and Gas Interests. As used

fraction of the costs relating to the exploration, development and operation
of such Well no greater than the Working Interest set out in the Reserve
Reports in connection with Chaparrals or a Subsidiarys interest in such Well

satisfied by it hereunder; (ii) receipt of any notice or other communication
in writing from any third party alleging that the Consent of such third party
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (including the Merger or as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby) or any non-compliance with any Law; (iii) receipt of any
notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger or
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby); (iv) the discovery of
any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would reasonably be expected
to cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article
VI not being satisfied or the satisfaction of those conditions being
materially delayed; or (v) the commencement or threat, in writing, of any
Action against any Party or any of its affiliates, or any of their respective
properties or assets, or, to the knowledge of Chaparral or Parent, as
applicable, any officer, director, partner, member or manager, in his or her
capacity as such, of Chaparral or Parent, as applicable, or any of their
affiliates with respect to the consummation of the Merger. No such notice to
any Party shall constitute an acknowledgement or admission by the Party
providing notice regarding whether or not any of the conditions to Closing or
to the 



 

41  consummation of the Merger have been satisfied or in determining whether or
not any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement have been breached.

5.2 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the
Effective Time, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall cooperate fully with the other Parties, to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Proxy
Statement (including the receipt of all authorizations, approvals and permits
required to be obtained from or made with any Governmental Authority in order
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the "Requisite Regulatory Approvals")), and the satisfaction, but not the
waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in Article VI), and to comply
promptly with all requirements of Governmental Authorities applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Parent, Merger Sub, Chaparral and each Subsidiary will cooperate with each
other and will take all commercially reasonable steps, and proceed diligently
and in good faith: (i) to submit any necessary filings, amendments or
revisions to any required Governmental Authority or other third party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) to promptly
submit and make other applications, notices and submissions (or amendments to
any of the foregoing previously submitted) with any Governmental Authority or
other third party which must be filed in order for Chaparral to obtain all
Consents which must be obtained prior to the Closing in order for Chaparral
and the Subsidiaries to operate their respective business as currently
operated and currently intended by the Parties to be operated following the
Closing; provided, however, that Chaparral shall not file any application,
notice or other submission to any Governmental Authority or other third party
that is not in the ordinary course of business of Chaparral consistent with
past practices without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such application, notice or other submission and without
obtaining the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); provided, further, however, that Chaparral shall be
solely responsible for the submission of all such applications, notices and
submissions. All such filings shall be made, if not already made, as promptly
as practicable (but no later than 30 days after the date of this Agreement)
and Parent shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested by Chaparral in
connection with such Consents.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in Sections 5.2(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any applicable Law or if
any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any applicable
Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of
the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Law or
which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and Chaparral
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections
or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

(d) In the event any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, Parent and
Chaparral shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor
Chaparral shall be required to agree to any term, condition or modification
with respect to obtaining any Consents in connection with the 



 

42  Merger or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in:
(i) a Material Adverse Effect of either Party or (ii) Parent, Merger Sub or
Chaparral having to cease, sell or otherwise dispose of any assets or business
(including the requirement that any such assets or business be held separate).

5.3 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnification by Chaparral_. From the date of this Agreement through
the one year anniversary of the Closing Date, Chaparral shall indemnify and
hold harmless each of Parent and Merger Sub, their affiliates and each of
their respective successors and assigns, and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents (each, a "Parent Indemnified Party") from and
against any liabilities, claims (including claims by third parties), demands,
judgments, losses, costs, damages or expenses whatsoever (including reasonable
attorneys, consultants and other professional fees and disbursements of
every kind, nature and description) (collectively, "Damages") such Parent
Indemnified Party may sustain, suffer or incur and that result from, arise out
of or relate to: (i) any breach by Chaparral or any Subsidiary of any of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered in connection with the Merger and/or
(ii) any fraud committed in connection with the execution and delivery of, or
the performance under, this Agreement by Chaparral or any Subsidiary. As the
sole remedy for the indemnity obligations set forth in this Section 5.3(a),
Parent shall reduce the number of Escrow Shares distributable to Chaparral
Stockholders by the value of the Damages.

The Escrow Shares shall be escrowed in accordance with the terms and
conditions of an escrow agreement to be entered into at the Closing between
Parent, Chaparral and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as escrow
agent, in the form mutually agreed to by the Parties and the escrow agent (the
"Indemnification Escrow Agreement"). The Indemnification Escrow Agreement
shall further provide that the Escrow Shares will be forfeited and cancelled
if the Escrow Shares are not earned pursuant to Section 1.4(a)(i) of this
Agreement. The value of each Escrow Share for purposes of paying any claim
for indemnification under this Section 5.3(a) shall be equal to the average
of the prices used in the 30-day period in Table X to determine that the
Chaparral Stockholders had earned the Escrow Shares. Any Escrow Shares
remaining after breaking of the escrow or reduction for Damages paid pursuant
to this Section 5.3(a) will be allocated among the Chaparral Stockholders in
accordance with _Exhibit B_.

(b) _Indemnification by Parent_. From the date of this Agreement through the
Closing Date, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold harmless
Chaparral, its affiliates and each of its successors and assigns, and its
officers, directors, employees and agents (each, a "Chaparral Indemnified
Party") from and against any Damages such Chaparral Indemnified Party may
sustain, suffer or incur and that result from, arise out of or relate to: (i)
any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered in connection with the Merger and/or (ii) any fraud
committed the execution and delivery of, or the performance under, this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub.

(c) _Indemnification Procedures_. A Person seeking indemnification under this
Section 5.3 (the "Indemnitee") must give timely written notice to the Person
from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") as soon as practical
after the Indemnitee becomes aware of any condition or event that gives rise
to Damages for which indemnification is sought under this Section 5.3. The
failure of the Indemnitee to give timely notice shall not affect the
Indemnitees rights to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnitor demonstrates it was materially prejudiced by such failure. In the
event a claim or demand is made by a party against an Indemnitee, the
Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor of such claim or demand,
specifying the nature and the amount of the Damages (the "Claim Notice"). The
Indemnitor shall notify the Indemnitee within twenty (20) days after receipt
of the Claim Notice whether the Indemnitor will undertake, conduct and
control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its expense, the
settlement or defense thereof, and Indemnitee shall cooperate with Indemnitor
in connection therewith, provided that if Indemnitor undertakes such defense:
(i) Indemnitor shall not thereby permit to exist any Encumbrance or other
adverse charge upon any asset of Indemnitee or settle such action without
first obtaining the consent 



 

43  of Indemnitee, except for settlements solely covering monetary matters for
which Indemnitor has acknowledged responsibility for payment; (ii) Indemnitor
shall permit Indemnitee (at Indemnitees sole cost and expense) to
participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by
Indemnitee; and (iii) Indemnitor shall agree promptly to reimburse Indemnitee
for the full amount of any Damages resulting from such claim, except for
those costs expressly assumed by the Indemnitee hereunder. The Indemnitee
agrees to preserve and provide access to all evidence that may be useful in
defending against such claim and to provide reasonable cooperation in the
defense thereof or in the prosecution of any action against a third party in
connection therewith. The Indemnitors defense of any claim or demand shall
not constitute an admission or concession of liability therefor or otherwise
operate in derogation of any rights Indemnitor may have against Indemnitee or
any third party. So long as Indemnitor is reasonably contesting any such claim
in good faith, Indemnitee shall not pay or settle any such claim. If
Indemnitor does not notify Indemnitee within twenty (20) days after receipt
of Indemnitees Claim Notice that it elects to undertake the defense thereof,
Indemnitee shall have the right to contest the claim in the exercise of its
exclusive, reasonable discretion at the expense of the Indemnitor (provided
the Indemnitor shall not be required to pay Indemnitees expenses for the
defense, settlement or compromise of claims which are not covered by
Indemnitors obligations under this Section 5.3 or which Indemnitor has not
consented to).

(d) _Insurance Effect_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any
Damages that are subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement are
covered by insurance, the Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the maximum recovery under such insurance. If the Indemnitee
receives payment from the Indemnitor for indemnification under this Section
5.3 and later receives proceeds from insurance or other amounts in respect of
such Damages, then it shall hold such proceeds or other amounts in trust for
the benefit of the Indemnitor and shall pay to the Indemnitor, as promptly as
practicable after receipt, a sum equal to the amount of the proceeds or other
amount received, up to the aggregate amount of any payments received from the
Indemnitor pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Damages.

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to any claims for fraud, the
rights of any Parent Indemnified Party or Chaparral Indemnified Party for
indemnification relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be strictly limited to those contained in this Section 5.3, and,
except as specifically set forth in Section 9.10, such indemnification
rights, the right to cancel the Escrow Shares and the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of
such Parent Indemnified Party or Chaparral Indemnified Party, as applicable,
with respect to this Agreement or any matter arising under or in connection
with this Agreement. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Parent Indemnified Parties and the Chaparral Indemnified Parties hereby waive
all other rights and remedies, and release all claims against each other, with
respect to this Agreement or any matter arising under or in connection with
this Agreement, whether under any applicable Law, at common law or otherwise.

(f) _Limitations on Indemnification_. The Parties rights to
indemnification hereunder are subject to the following limitations:

(i) Except for claims made prior to the anniversary of the Closing Date but
not yet resolved, any claim for indemnification hereunder may not be pursued
and is hereby released by the Parties and irrevocably waived upon and after
the anniversary of the Closing Date.

(ii) Chaparral may not seek indemnification against the Trust Fund and may
only seek indemnification hereunder against Parent.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Chaparral and
the Chaparral Stockholders hereby irrevocably waive in perpetuity any and all
claims for indemnification hereunder against all other entities controlled by
Parent or its officers and directors; provided, however, that claims for fraud
are not waived hereby. 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Parent and its
affiliates hereby irrevocably waive in perpetuity any and all claims for
indemnification hereunder against all other 



 

44  entities controlled by Chaparral or its officers and directors; provided,
however, that claims for fraud are not waived hereby.

5.4 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Chaparral agree that no public release
or announcement concerning this Agreement or the Merger shall be issued by
either Party or any of their affiliates without the prior consent of the other
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except such release or announcement as may be required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in
which case the applicable Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
either Parent or Chaparral may make any public statement in response to
specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any
such statements are not inconsistent with previous public releases or
announcements made by Parent or Chaparral in compliance with this Agreement.

5.5 _Public Filings_. The Parties shall make all necessary filings with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable Blue Sky laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder, including filing a Current Report on Form
8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act to report the execution of this Agreement.
Parent will promptly advise Chaparral of any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests
by the SEC for additional information. No filing with respect to the Merger
and the transactions contemplated thereby, and no amendment or supplement to
such filings, shall be made without the prior written approval of Chaparral,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or
Chaparral, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by Parent or Chaparral that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders and warrantholders (if applicable) of Parent.

5.6 _Reservation of Stock_. Parent hereby agrees there shall be, or Parent
shall cause to be, reserved for issuance and delivery such number of shares
of Parent Common Stock as shall be required for issuance and delivery of the
Merger Consideration. Parent covenants it will authorize or cause to be
authorized such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as shall be sufficient
to issue the Merger Consideration.

5.7 _Stockholder Meeting and Warrantholder Meeting; Proxy_. As promptly as
practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Parent, acting through
its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable Law:

(a) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the
stockholders of Parent (the "Stockholder Meeting") for the purposes of
considering and taking action upon: (i) the amendment to the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent substantially in the form set
forth on _Exhibit D_ (the "Parent Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation"), (ii) approval of the Merger, including the issuance of the
Merger Consideration and (iii) the authorization and establishment by Parent
of a long-term incentive option plan substantially in the form set forth on
_Exhibit E_ (the "Long-Term Incentive Plan") (collectively, the "Stockholder
Matters");

(b) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the
warrantholders of Parent (the "Warrantholder Meeting") for the purposes of
considering certain amendments to the terms of the Warrant Agreement dated
December 11, 2007, by and between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, as warrant agent (the "Warrant Agreement"), covering all of the
Warrants, which must be approved by a majority in interest of the Warrants
(the "Required Warrantholder Vote"), to allow for the redemption or
restructure of the Warrants within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date (the
"Warrant 



 

45  Restructure", and collectively with the Stockholder Matters, the "Proxy
Matters") (collectively, the "Warrantholder Proposal"). The terms of
any amendment to the Warrant Agreement to allow for the Warrant Restructure
must be mutually agreeable to Parent and Chaparral. Parent shall cause its
investment bankers listed on _Section 3.21_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
to keep Chaparral regularly apprised of the status of the negotiations with
respect to the Warrant Restructure and any expected or anticipated terms and
conditions of the Warrant Restructure;

(c)(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the approvals required
by the stockholders and warrantholders of Parent and (ii) include in the
Proxy Statement (A) the Board of Directors recommendation to the stockholders
and warrantholders of Parent that they vote in favor of all Proxy Matters and
(B) all other requests or approvals necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
adjourn or postpone the Stockholder Meeting or Warrantholder Meeting as and to
the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders and warrantholders as promptly as practicable after the Proxy
Statement is declared effective by the SEC. Chaparral shall cooperate and
assist Parent and its counsel in preparing the Proxy Statement and
acknowledges that a substantial portion of the Proxy Statement shall include
disclosure regarding Chaparral and its management, operations and financial
condition. Chaparral shall make its managers, directors, officers, employees
and consultants available to Parent and its counsel in connection with the
drafting of the Proxy Statement and responding in a timely manner to comments
from the SEC. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and
each amendment thereto, Chaparral shall confirm in writing to Parent and its
counsel that it has reviewed the Proxy Statement (and each amendment thereto)
and approved any information provided by Chaparral and the Chaparral
Stockholders. If, prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect
to Chaparral, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied
by Chaparral or inclusion in the Proxy Statement, Chaparral shall promptly
notify Parent of such event, and Chaparral and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement and, as required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to Parents stockholders and
warrantholders; and

(d) promptly transmit any amendment or supplement to its stockholders or
warrantholders, if at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting or
Warrantholder Meeting, respectively, there shall be discovered any information
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement. 

5.8 _Directors and Officers of Parent; Consultants_.

take all necessary actions so that the persons identified in _Section 5.8_
of the Parent Disclosure Schedules are elected to the positions of officers of

take all necessary actions so that the persons identified in the Proxy
Statement (which are selected pursuant to the methodology set forth in
_Section 5.8_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedules) are elected to the
positions of directors of Parent effective immediately after the Closing. 

5.9 _Hart-Scott-Rodino Filing_. If required pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
Chaparral shall each prepare and file the notifications required of them
thereunder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall promptly and in good faith respond to all information requested of
them by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice in connection
with such notification and otherwise cooperate in good faith with each other
and such Governmental Authorities. Parent and Chaparral shall (a)
promptly inform the other of any communication to or from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) give the other
prompt notice of the commencement of any action, suit, litigation,
arbitration, proceeding or investigation by or before any Governmental
Authority with respect to such transactions and (c) keep the other reasonably
informed as to the status of any such action, suit, 



 

46  litigation, arbitration, proceeding or investigation. Parent and Chaparral
shall split equally all filing fees relating to such filing.

any reasonable fees and expenses payable to Parents investment bankers as

Redemption), and any other of Parents or Merger Subs reasonable unpaid
costs, fees and expenses associated with this Agreement, the Proxy Statement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without
limitation any due diligence expenses incurred.

5.11 _Tax Treatment_. Each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger and the Short-Form Merger described in Section
5.14, collectively, to qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code and will not take any action inconsistent with the
Merger and the Short-Form Merger, collectively, qualifying as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code. Chaparral and Parent shall treat the Merger
Consideration received in the Merger by holders of Chaparral Common Stock as
property permitted to be received by Section 354 of the Code without the
recognition of gain. Each of Chaparral and Parent covenants and agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to defend in good faith all challenges to
the treatment of the Merger and the Short-Form Merger, collectively, as a
reorganization as described in this Section 5.11. Each of Chaparral and Parent
agree that if such Party becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that
is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, it will promptly
notify the other Party in writing of such fact or circumstance. Each of
Chaparral and Parent will comply with all reporting and record-keeping
obligations set forth in the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations
that are consistent with the Merger and the Short-Form Merger, collectively,
qualifying as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

5.12 _New York Office_. The initial 2010 annual budget for overhead expenses
to maintain a New York City office at the corporate headquarters of the
Sponsor shall be $1,200,000 (excluding any compensation John A. Catsimatidis
receives as Executive Chairman of the Board). The New York office will be used
to support the usual activities of an Executive Chairman of the Board of
Directors and/or other New York-based directors, as well as serving as a New
York base for senior officers of Parent when they are in New York, with such
budget to encompass occupancy expenses as well as other corporate expenses
related to that office.

5.13 _Change of Parent Year-End_. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, Parent shall file all forms, make all elections, obtain
all approvals and take any and all other actions necessary to change its year-
end from August 31 to December 31 for both financial reporting and tax
reporting purposes.

5.14 _Merger of Surviving Company into Parent_. Concurrently with the Closing,
the Surviving Company shall be merged with and into Parent pursuant to
Section 253 of the DGCL (the "Short-Form Merger"). As a result of the Short-
Form Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Company shall
cease and Parent shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Short-
Form Merger.

5.15 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. The certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Parent and Surviving Company shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Chaparral as of the
date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at or
prior to the Closing Date were directors, officers, agents or employees of
Chaparral. Parent shall cause (including, without limitation, by paying
premiums 



 

47  on the current insurance policies) to be maintained in effect for six (6)
years after the Closing Date the current policies of the directors and
officers liability or equivalent insurance maintained by or on behalf of
Chaparral with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than the
existing policies (including with respect to the period covered). After
Closing and except for actions, suits, proceedings, hearings, investigations
and claims by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 5.3(a), Parent
will indemnify each individual who served as a director, officer or employee
of Chaparral at any time prior to the Closing Date from and against all
actions, suits, proceedings, hearings, investigations and claims including all
court costs and reasonable attorney fees and expenses resulting from or
arising out of, or caused by, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE VII

_TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT_

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time, notwithstanding any approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Parent and the Chaparral
Stockholders, as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Chaparral and Parent, as duly authorized by
the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors of Chaparral;

(b) by written notice by either Parent or Chaparral if the Closing conditions
set forth in Section 6.1 have not been satisfied by Chaparral or Parent, as
the case may be (or waived by Parent or Chaparral as the case may be) by
December 11, 2009;  _provided_ , _however_ , such date shall be extended
through June 11, 2010 in the event Parent is able to obtain stockholder
approval to extend the corporate existence of Parent on or before December 11,
2009. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose action or
inaction is the primary cause of, or resulted in, any such condition set forth
in Section 6.1 to fail to be fulfilled;

(c) by written notice by either Parent or Chaparral, if any Governmental
Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Order or Law that is, in each case, then in effect and is final and
nonappealable and has the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise preventing or prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger); _provided_ , _however_ , the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to
any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the primary cause of, or resulted in, any such Order or Law to have been
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered;

(d) by written notice by Parent, if (i) there has been a breach by Chaparral
of any of its material representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, or if any material representation or warranty of
Chaparral shall have become untrue or inaccurate, and (ii) the breach or
inaccuracy is incapable of being cured prior to the Closing or is not cured
within twenty (20) days of notice of such breach or inaccuracy;

(e) by written notice by Chaparral, if (i) there has been a breach by Parent
or Merger Sub of any of its material representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any material representation
or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall have become untrue or inaccurate,
and (ii) the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured prior to the
Closing or is not cured within twenty (20) days of notice of such breach or
inaccuracy;

(f) by written notice by Parent if the Closing conditions set forth in Section
6.2, other than Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) (which are addressed by Section
7.1(d)), have not been satisfied by Chaparral (or waived by Parent) by
December 11, 2009; _provided_ , _however_ , such date shall be extended
through June 11, 2010 in the event Parent is able to obtain stockholder
approval to extend the corporate existence of Parent on or before December
11, 2009. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 7.1(f) shall not be available to Parent if Parent is in
material breach of any representation, warranty 



 

52  or covenant contained in this Agreement, and such breach has primarily
caused the Closing conditions set forth in Section 6.2 to not be satisfied; or

(g) by written notice by Chaparral if the Closing conditions set forth in
Section 6.3, other than Sections 6.3(a) and 6.3(b) (which are addressed by
Section 7.1(e)), have not been satisfied by Parent (or waived by Chaparral) by
December 11, 2009; _provided_ , _however_ , such date shall be extended
through June 11, 2010 in the event Parent is able to obtain stockholder
approval to extend the corporate existence of Parent on or before December 11,
2009. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 7.1(g) shall not be available to Chaparral if Chaparral is
in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement, and such breach has primarily caused the Closing conditions
set forth in Section 6.3 to not be satisfied.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and
there shall be no liability on the part of any Party or any of their
respective affiliates or the directors, officers, partners, members, managers,
employees, agents or other representatives of any of them, and all rights and
obligations of each Party shall cease, except: (i) as set forth in Sections
4.2(c) and (d), this Section 7.2 and in Section 7.3 and (ii) subject to
Section 5.3, nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for any
fraud committed by the willful breach of this Agreement prior to termination.
Without limiting the foregoing, and except as provided in Section 5.3, the
Parties sole right with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement by another Party or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be the right, if applicable, to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1. Section 5.3, this Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, including this Section
7.3, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
Expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other related transaction is
consummated. Upon the Closing, Parent will be responsible for any unpaid
Expenses incurred by Chaparral and Parent in connection with the Merger. Each
Party shall, upon the request of the other Party, disclose the costs that such
Party has incurred or anticipates to incur with respect to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated herein.

(b) If (i) Parent obtains stockholder approval to extend its corporate
existence beyond December 11, 2009, and (ii) prior to obtaining the Required
Parent Vote on the Stockholder Matters, the Parent board of directors shall
have (1) effected or authorized a change in its recommendation to the
stockholders of Parent to approve the Merger and (2) consummated a transaction
with a company other than Chaparral prior to June 11, 2010, then Parent shall
pay to Chaparral $2,000,000. In the event of the foregoing, this Section
7.3(b) shall constitute the sole remedy and entire liability and damages of
Parent to Chaparral as a result of the foregoing (for purposes of
clarification, in the event of the foregoing, Chaparral shall not be entitled
to any payment under Section 7.3(c)).

(c) If (i) all conditions to Closing of the Parties set forth in Article VI
have been met or would be met on or before June 11, 2010 but for a failure of
a condition caused by the action or inaction of Parent or its affiliates, and
(ii) Parent elects not to consummate the Merger for any reason other than set
forth in Section 7.1(a), Sections 7.1(b)(c) (not caused by the action,
inaction or the fault of Parent or its affiliates), Section 7.1(d) and/or
Section 7.1(f) (not caused by the action, inaction or the fault of Parent or
its affiliates), then Parent shall reimburse Chaparral for all of its
reasonable and actual out of pocket costs incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
reimbursed expenses shall not exceed $750,000, such amount to be paid solely
and exclusively from the $3,700,000 of working capital of Parent.

Nothing in this Section 7.3 shall be deemed to require Parent to extend its
corporate existence beyond December 11, 2009.



 

53 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time. This Agreement may only be amended pursuant to a
written agreement signed by all of the Parties hereto.

7.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable
Law, any Party hereto may in its sole discretion: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other Party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties by such other Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance by such other Party with any agreement or condition contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by Chaparral, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder.

ARTICLE VIII

_TRUST FUND WAIVER_

8.1 _Trust Fund Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of Parent,
dated December 11, 2007 (the "Prospectus"). Chaparral understands that, except
for a portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Fund,
Parent may disburse monies from the Trust Fund only: (a) to its public
stockholders in the event of the redemption of their shares or the dissolution
and liquidation of Parent, (b) to Parent and the underwriters listed in the
Prospectus (with respect to such underwriters deferred underwriting
compensation only) after Parent consummates a business combination (as
described in the Prospectus) or (c) as consideration to the sellers of a
target business with which Parent completes a business combination. Chaparral
agrees that Chaparral does not now have, and shall not at any time prior to
the Closing have, any claim to, or make any claim against, the Trust Fund or
any asset contained therein, regardless of whether such claim arises as a
result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, the business
relationship between Chaparral, on the one hand, and Parent and/or Merger Sub,
on the other hand, this Agreement, or any other agreement or any other matter,
and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity
or any other theory of legal liability. Chaparral hereby irrevocably waives
any and all claims it may have, now or in the future (in each case, however,
prior to the consummation of a business combination), and will not seek
recourse against, the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever in respect thereof.
To the extent Chaparral commences any action or proceeding based upon, in
connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Parent
or Merger Sub, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief
against Parent or Merger Sub, Chaparral hereby acknowledges and agrees its
sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Fund and that
such claim shall not permit Chaparral (or any party claiming on Chaparrals
behalf or in lieu of Chaparral) to have any claim against the Trust Fund or
any amounts contained therein. This Section 8.1 shall not limit any covenant
or agreement of the Parties that by its terms contemplates performance after
the Effective Time.

ARTICLE IX 

_MISCELLANEOUS_

9.1 _Survival_. Any covenant that by its terms contemplates performance after
the Effective Time shall survive beyond the Closing Date, and the
representations and warranties contained herein shall survive for a period of
one year from the Closing Date.

execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the

been taken or waived, shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and Chaparral irrevocably consents to the 



 

55  service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any other
action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal delivery of
copies of such process to such Party. Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall affect
the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

9.5 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties hereby waives to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury
with respect to any Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
of the Parties: (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party
would not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other Parties have been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 9.5.

9.6  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including
by facsimile or electronic transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by
the different Parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

9.7  _Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained in this

Chaparral, shall mean the actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry of the

necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other

the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

LOCK UP AGREEMENT



   To: | United Refining Energy Corp. 
---|--- 

823 Eleventh Avenue

New York, NY 10019

_Re: Proposed Business Combination Involving United Refining Energy Corp. and
Chaparral Energy, Inc._

 



   1. | Acknowledgement. The undersigned acknowledges that United Refining
Energy Corp. ("United") and Chaparral Energy, Inc. ("Chaparral") are
intending to complete a proposed business combination pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement") dated October 9,
2009 between United, Chaparral and Chaparral Subsidiary, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of United. In consideration of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the undersigned), the
undersigned covenants and agrees with United as follows with respect to the
shares of United common stock issued or issuable to the undersigned (or to
persons or entities with respect to which the undersigned would
have beneficial ownership of such shares within the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission) whether pursuant to the Merger
Agreement as Stock Consideration or Earn-Out Shares (as such terms are defined
in the Merger Agreement) or issued and held in escrow as Sponsor Earn-out
Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) (the "United
Shares"). The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned
has full power and authority to enter into the agreements set forth herein. 
---|--- 



   2. | Lock-Up. The undersigned represents and warrants to United that,
for the duration of the Lock-Up Period (as defined below), the undersigned
will not, directly or indirectly: (i) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell,
lend, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, make any short sale or
otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any United Shares,
(ii) establish or increase any "put equivalent position" or liquidate or
decrease any "call equivalent position" with respect to any United Shares (in
each case within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) or
otherwise enter into any swap, derivative or other transaction or arrangement
that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any economic consequence of
ownership of any United Shares, whether or not such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of United Shares, other securities, cash or other
consideration, or (iii) engage directly or indirectly in any transaction, the
likely result of which would involve a transaction prohibited by either of
clauses (i) or (ii). The undersigned shall not be prohibited from pledging the
undersigned United Shares so long as any pledgee receiving such pledge agrees
in writing to be bound by the terms of this Lock Up Agreement; provided
that the undersigned may not pledge any United Shares, if any, that are held
in escrow pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or the Securities
Escrow Agreement (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement). The
foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from
engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to, or
reasonably expected to lead to, or result in, a sale or disposition of any
United Shares even if such United Shares would be disposed of by someone
other than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions
would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant
of any right (including without limitation any put or call option)
with respect to any of the United Shares or with respect to any security that
includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from the
United Shares. The undersigned agrees and consents to the entry of stop
transfer instructions with Uniteds transfer agent and registrar against, and
authorizes United to cause the transfer agent and registrar to decline, the
transfer of relevant securities held by the undersigned except in compliance
with the foregoing restrictions. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph
shall not apply to transactions relating to United Shares or other securities
acquired in open market transactions after completion of the Merger. 
---|--- 


   3. |

Lock-Up Period. For the purposes hereof, the "Lock-Up Period" shall mean (i)
with respect to all of the United Shares which constitute the Stock
Consideration (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement),  

---|--- 



 

61  the period beginning on the Closing Date (as such term is defined in the
Merger Agreement) and ending on the date that is the one year anniversary of
the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to all of the United Shares that
constitute Earn-Out Shares or Sponsor Earn-Out Shares (as such terms are
defined in the Merger Agreement), the period beginning on the date on which
such Earn-Out Shares or Sponsor Earn-Out Shares, as applicable, are deemed
earned and ending on the date that is the six month anniversary of such date. 

---|--- 



   4. | Conditions Precedent. United and the undersigned hereby
acknowledge and agree that the execution and delivery of this lockup is
conditioned on the execution and delivery of an identical lockup agreement by
each of [Fischer Investments, L.L.C., Altoma Energy G.P., CHK Holdings, LLC
and United Refining, Inc.]. In addition, if the restrictions of any other
lock-up agreement are released, reduced or waived for any of the foregoing
parties or persons, such release, modification or waiver will be automatically
extended to the undersigned and notice of such action will be provided to the
undersigned. 
---|--- 


   5. | Termination. This agreement shall be terminated only upon the
earlier of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement and (ii) one calendar
day following the date that the applicable Lock-Up Period ends as provided in
paragraph 3 hereof. The undersigned further understands that this agreement is
irrevocable, and that all authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred
shall survive death or incapacity of the undersigned and will be binding on
the undersigned and the respective successors, heirs, personal
representatives, and assigns of the undersigned. 
---|--- 


   6. | Damages. The undersigned recognizes and acknowledges that this
agreement is an integral part of the Merger Agreement and that a breach by the
undersigned of any covenants or other commitments contained in this Agreement
will cause the other party to sustain injury for which it may not have an
adequate remedy at law for money damages. Therefore, the undersigned agrees
that in the event of any such breach, United shall be entitled to the remedy
of specific performance of such covenants or commitments and preliminary and
permanent injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other
remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity, and the undersigned
agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable
relief. 
---|--- 


   7. | Governing Law. This agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable therein
(without regard to conflict of laws principles). 
---|--- 



   8. | Facsimile. United and the undersigned shall be entitled to rely on
delivery of a facsimile copy hereof which shall be legally effective to create
a valid and binding agreement of the undersigned and United in accordance
with the terms hereof. 
---|--- 



   9. | Counterparts. This agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 
---|--- 



   10. | Entire Agreement. This agreement constitutes the entire agreement
and understanding between the parties pertaining to the subject matter of this
agreement.

64 _EXHIBIT A_

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF UNITED REFINING ENERGY CORP.

FIRST: The name of the corporation is Chaparral Energy, Inc. (the
"Corporation").

SECOND: The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is Capitol Services, Inc., 615 S. Dupont Highway, Dover, Delaware
19901, County of Kent. The name of the Corporations registered agent at such
address is Capitol Services, Inc.

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the "DGCL"). 

FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 360,000,000, of which
350,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock of the par value of $.0001 per share
and 10,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock of the par value of $.0001 per
share.

A. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is expressly granted authority to
issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for
each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and
such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated
and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of
Directors providing for the issue of such series (a "Preferred Stock
Designation") and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The number of authorized
shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding
shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a
separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof,
unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock
Designation.

B. Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided
in any Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of the Common Stock shall
exclusively possess all voting power and each share of Common Stock shall have
one vote.

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effect by any consent in
writing by such stockholders.

FIFTH: The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time
exclusively by the resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in
office, but shall consist of not less than three (3) and not more than
thirteen (13) members. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three
classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. The number of directors in each
class shall be as nearly equal as possible. At each annual stockholders
meeting after the adoption of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms
expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding
annual meeting of stockholders after their election. Except as the DGCL may
otherwise require, in the interim between annual meetings of stockholders or
special meetings of stockholders called for the election of directors and/or
the removal of one or more directors and the filling of any vacancy in that
connection, newly created directorships and any vacancies in the Board of
Directors, including unfilled vacancies resulting from the removal of
directors for cause, may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining
directors then in office, although less than a quorum (as defined in the
Corporations Bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. All directors shall
hold 



 

65  office until the expiration of their respective terms of office and until
their successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director elected to
fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director
shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the director whose death,
resignation or removal shall have created such vacancy and until his successor
shall have been elected and qualified.

SIXTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation
and of its directors and stockholders:

A. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the by-laws of
the Corporation so provide.

B. The Board of Directors shall have the power, without the assent or vote of
the stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the bylaws
of the Corporation.

C. In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done
by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes
of Delaware, of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and to
any bylaws from time to time made by the stockholders; provided, however,
that no bylaw so made shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which
would have been valid if such bylaw had not been made.

SEVENTH: A. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to
the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of
fiduciary duty by such director as a director, except for liability (i) for
any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174
of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate
action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors,
then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal
or modification of this Article Eighth shall not adversely affect any right
or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to events
occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

B. To the maximum extent permitted by law in effect from time to time, the
Corporation shall indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination
of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, shall pay or reimburse
reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to (a)
any individual who is a present or former director or officer of the
Corporation and who is made a party to the proceeding by reason of his service
in that capacity or (b) any individual who, while a director of the
Corporation and at the request of the Corporation, serves or has served
another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise as a director, officer,
partner or trustee of such corporation, real estate investment trust,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other
enterprise and who is made a party to the proceeding by reason of his service
in that capacity against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and
reasonable expenses incurred by then, unless it is established that (i) the
act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving
rise to the proceeding and (A) was committed in bad faith or (B) was the
result of active or deliberate dishonestly, (ii) the director or officer
actually received an improper personal benefit, or (iii) in the case of any
criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe
that the act or omission was unlawful. The Corporation may, with the approval
of its Board of Directors, provide such indemnification and advance for
expenses to a person who served a predecessor of the Corporation in any of
the capacities described in (a) or (b) above and to any employee or agent of
the Corporation or a predecessor of the Corporation.

The Corporation shall, as a condition to advancing expenses to a director or
officer, obtain a written undertaking by or on behalf of such director or
officer to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Corporation 



 

66  if it shall ultimately be determined that such persons are not entitled to
be indemnified by the Corporation under law or applicable contract.

Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article Seventh, nor the adoption or
amendment of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation
inconsistent with the Article Seventh shall eliminate or reduce the effect of
this Article Seventh in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of
action, suit to claim that, but for this Article Seventh, would accrue or
arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent
provision.

EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a
summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or
on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation
under Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of
trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this
Corporation under Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting
of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such
manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three
fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the
stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may
be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this
Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said
compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by
the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the
creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of
stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be, and also on
this Corporation.

a. General. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. A majority
of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the acts of a
majority of the members of the Committee who are present at any meeting
thereof at which a quorum is present, or the acts unanimously approved by the
members of the Committee in writing, shall be the acts of the Committee.

b. Committee Authority. Subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law,
and in addition to other express powers and authorizations conferred on the
Committee by the Plan, the Committee shall have full power and authority to:
(i) designate Participants; (ii) determine the type or types of Awards to be
granted to a Participant; (iii) determine the number of Shares to be covered
by, or with respect to which payments, rights, or other matters are to be
calculated in connection with, Awards; (iv) determine the terms and 



 

70  conditions of any Award; (v) determine whether, to what extent, and under

suspended and the method or methods by which Awards may be settled, exercised,

the Committee shall vote or act upon any matter relating solely to himself and
grants of Awards to members of the Committee must be ratified by the Board.
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, all designations,
determinations, interpretations, and other decisions under or with respect to
the Plan or any Award shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee,
may be made at any time and shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all
Persons, including the Company, any Affiliate, any Participant, any holder or
beneficiary of any Award, any stockholder and any Employee.

c. Delegation. The Committee may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer and
to other senior officers of the Company its duties under the Plan pursuant to

take other action with respect to, Participants who are subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act.

Company to whom the Committee has delegated authority shall be liable for any
action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any

(including legal fees) arising therefrom to the full extent permitted by

4\. _Shares Available for Awards_.

a. Shares Available. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c), the
aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted under
the Plan shall be up to 7,500,000 Shares. If any Award is exercised, paid,
forfeited, terminated or canceled without the delivery of Shares, then the
Shares covered by such Award, to the extent of such payment, exercise,
forfeiture, termination or cancellation, shall again be Shares with respect to
which Awards may be granted. Awards will not reduce the number of Shares that
may be issued pursuant to the Plan if the settlement of the Award will not
require the issuance of Shares, as, for example, an Other Stock-Based Award
that can be satisfied only by the payment of cash.

b. Sources of Shares Deliverable Under Awards. Any Shares delivered pursuant
to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued
Shares or of treasury Shares and shall be fully paid and nonassessable.

c. Adjustments. In the event that the Committee determines that any dividend
or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities,
or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,
repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the
Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other
securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event
affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to
be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or
potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the
Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of
(i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) with
respect to which Awards may be granted, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or
other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the
grant or exercise price with respect to any Award. 



 

71 5\. _Eligibility_.

Any Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant shall be eligible to be
designated a Participant and receive an Award under the Plan. 

6\. _Awards_.

a. Options. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have
the authority to determine the Participants to whom Options shall be granted,
the number of Shares to be covered by each Option, the purchase price
therefor and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the
Option, including the following terms and conditions and such additional terms
and conditions, as the Committee shall determine, that are not inconsistent
with the provisions of the Plan.

i. _Exercise Price and Grant Date_. The purchase price per Share purchasable
under an Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time the Option is
granted, but shall not be less than the Fair Market Value per Share on such
grant date. The grant date shall not be earlier than the date on which the
Committee approves such grant.

ii. _Time and Method of Exercise_. The Committee shall determine the time or
times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part (which may
include the achievement of one or more Performance Objectives), and the method
or methods by which, and the form or forms, in which payment of the exercise
price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made (which may
include, without limitation, cash, check acceptable to the Company, Shares
held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Companys reported
financial earnings and owned free and clear of any liens, claims,
encumbrances or security interests, outstanding Awards, a " _cashless_ " or "
_cashless-_ _broker_ " exercise (through procedures approved by the Committee
and the Company), other securities or other property, notes approved by the
Committee, or any combination thereof, having a Fair Market Value on the
exercise date equal to the relevant exercise price); _provided, however_ , in
order to exercise an Option, the Person or Persons entitled to exercise the
Option shall deliver to the Company payment in full for the Shares being
purchased and, unless other arrangements have been made with, or procedures
have been established and approved by, the Committee for a cashless or
cashless-broker exercise less any required withholding taxes.

iii. _Incentive Stock Options_. The aggregate number of Shares with respect to
Incentive Stock Options that may be granted under the Plan shall be up to
1,500,000 Shares. The terms of any Option granted under the Plan intended to
be an incentive stock option shall comply in all respects with the provisions
of Section 422 of the Code, or any successor provision, and any regulations
promulgated thereunder. Incentive stock options may be granted only to
employees of the Company and its parent corporation and subsidiary
corporations, within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code. To the extent the
aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares (determined as of the date of grant)
exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under all plans of
the Company and its parent and subsidiary corporations) exceeds $100,000, such
Shares in excess of $100,000 shall be classified as nonqualified stock
options. No Option that is an incentive stock option shall be exercisable
after the expiration of 10 years from its date of grant. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any person owning stock
possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of the Company and
its Affiliates be granted an incentive stock option hereunder unless (1) the
Option exercise price shall be at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of the
Shares subject to such Option at the time the Option is granted and (2) the
term during which such Option is exercisable does not exceed five years from
its date of grant.

iv. _Limits_. The maximum number of Options that may be granted to any
Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed 500,000 Shares.

b. Restricted Stock. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee
shall have the authority to determine the Participants to whom Restricted
Stock shall be granted, the number of Shares of Restricted 



 

72  Stock to be granted to each Participant, the duration of the Restricted
Period during which, and the conditions, including Performance Objectives, if
any, under which if not achieved, the Restricted Stock may be forfeited to
the Company, and the other terms and conditions of such Awards.

i.  _Dividends_. Dividends paid on Restricted Stock may be paid directly to
the Participant, may be subject to risk of forfeiture and/or transfer
restrictions during any period established by the Committee or sequestered and
held in a bookkeeping cash account (with or without interest) or reinvested
in additional shares of Common Stock, which account or shares may be subject
to the same restrictions as the underlying Award or such other restrictions,
all as determined by the Committee in its discretion.

ii. _Registration_. Any Restricted Stock may be evidenced in such manner as
the Committee shall deem appropriate, including, without limitation, book-
entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates. In the
event any stock certificate is issued in respect of Restricted Stock granted
under the Plan, such certificate shall be registered in the name of the
Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms,
conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock.

iii. _Forfeiture and Restrictions Lapse_. Except as otherwise determined by
the Committee or the terms of the Award that granted the Restricted Stock,
upon termination of a Participants employment (as determined under criteria
established by the Committee) for any reason during the applicable Restricted
Period, all Restricted Stock shall be forfeited by the Participant and
reacquired by the Company. Unrestricted Shares, evidenced in such manner as
the Committee shall deem appropriate, shall be issued to the holder of
Restricted Stock promptly after the applicable restrictions have lapsed or
otherwise been satisfied.

iv. _Transfer Restrictions_. During the Restricted Period, Restricted Stock
will be subject to the limitations on transfer as provided in Section
6(h)(i).

v. _Limits_. The maximum number of Shares of Restricted Stock that may be
granted to any Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed 250,000
Shares.

c. Performance Awards. The Committee shall have the authority to determine the
Participants who shall receive a Performance Award, which shall be denominated
as a cash amount (e.g., $100 per award unit) at the time of grant and confer
on the Participant the right to receive payment of such Award, in whole or in
part, upon the achievement of such Performance Objectives during such
performance periods as the Committee shall establish with respect to the
Award.

i. _Terms and Conditions_. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable
Award Agreement, the Committee shall determine the Performance Objectives to
be achieved during any performance period, the length of any performance
period, the amount of any Performance Award and the amount of any payment or
transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Award. In the case of any
Performance Award granted to a Covered Person in any calendar year,
Performance Objectives shall be designed to be objective and shall otherwise
meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and regulations issued
thereunder (including Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27 and any successor
regulation thereto), including the requirement that the level or levels of
performance targeted by the Committee are such that the achievement of
Performance Objectives is "substantially uncertain" at the time of grant. In
addition, achievement of Performance Objectives in respect of Performance
Awards shall be measured over a performance period of not less than six (6)
months and not more than one year, as specified by the Committee. Performance
Objectives in the case of any Performance Award granted to a Covered Person
shall be established not later than ninety (90) days after the beginning of
any performance period applicable to such Performance Award, or at such other
date as may be required or permitted for " _performance-based compensation_ "
under Section 162(m) of the Code. Subject to Section 8, the Committee shall
not exercise discretion to increase any amount payable in respect of a
Performance Award which is intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code.

ii. _Payment of Performance Awards_. Performance Awards, to the extent earned,
shall be paid (in cash and/or in Shares, in the sole discretion of the
Committee) in a lump sum following the close of the 



 

73  performance period. Except as may otherwise be required under Section 409A
of the Code, payment described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be
made no later than the date that is 2 1/2 months after the end of the year in
which the Performance Award is earned and vested under the Plan, and such
payment shall not be subject to any election by the Participant to defer the
payment to a later period. To the extent that settlement is to be made in
Shares, the amount payable under a Performance Award shall be divided by the
Fair Market Value per Share of Common Stock on the determination date and a
stock certificate evidencing the resulting shares of Common Stock (to the
nearest full share) shall be delivered to the Participant, or his personal
representative, and the value of any fractional shares will be paid in cash.

iii. _Limits_. The maximum value of Performance Awards that may be granted to
any Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed $2,000,000.

d. Bonus Shares. The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to
grant Bonus Shares to Participants. Each Bonus Share shall constitute a
transfer of an unrestricted Share to the Participant, without other payment
therefor, as additional compensation for the Participants services to the
Company. The maximum number of Bonus Shares that may be granted to any
Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed 200,000 Shares.

e. Phantom Shares. The Committee shall have the authority to grant Awards of
Phantom Shares to Participants upon such terms and conditions as the Committee
may determine.

i. _Terms and Conditions_. Each Phantom Share Award shall constitute an
agreement by the Company to issue or transfer a specified number of Shares or
pay an amount of cash equal to a specified number of Shares, or a combination
thereof to the Participant in the future, subject to the fulfillment during
the Restricted Period of such conditions, including Performance Objectives, if
any, as the Committee may specify at the date of grant. During the Restricted
Period, the Participant shall not have any right to transfer any rights under
the subject Award, shall not have any rights of ownership in the Phantom
Shares and shall not have any right to vote such shares.

ii. _Limits_. The maximum number of Phantom Shares that may be granted to any
Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed 500,000.

f. Cash Awards. The Committee shall have the authority to determine the
Participants to whom Cash Awards shall be granted, the amount, and the terms
or conditions, if any, as additional compensation for the Participants
services to the Company or its Affiliates. If granted, a Cash Award shall be
granted (simultaneously or subsequently) in tandem with another Award and
shall entitle a Participant to receive a specified amount of cash from the
Company upon such other Award becoming taxable to the Participant, which cash
amount may be based on a formula relating to the anticipated taxable income
associated with such other Award and the payment of the Cash Award.

g. Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee may also grant to Participants an
Other Stock-Based Award, which shall consist of a right which is an Award
denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or
otherwise based on or related to, Shares as is deemed by the Committee to be
consistent with the purposes of the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan,
including the Performance Objectives, if any, applicable to such Award, the
Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of any such Other Stock-
Based Award. The maximum number of Shares or value for which Other Stock-Based
Awards may be granted to any Participant during any calendar year shall not
exceed 250,000 Shares, if the Award is in Shares, or $2,000,000, if the Award
is in dollars.

h. General.

i. _Limits on Transfer of Awards_.

(1) Except as provided in (C) below, each Award, and each right under any
Award, shall be exercisable as specified in the terms of the Award Agreement
only by the Participant during the 



 

74  Participants lifetime, or by the person to whom the Participants rights
shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

(2) Except as provided in (C) below, no Award and no right under any such
Award may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise
transferred or encumbered by a Participant otherwise than by will or by the
laws of descent and distribution (or, in the case of Restricted Stock, to the
Company). Any such attempted or purported assignment, alienation, pledge,
attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void, ineffective and
unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate, and shall give no right to
the purported transferee, and shall at the sole discretion of the Committee
result in the forfeiture of the Award with respect to the Award involved in
such attempted or perpetual transfer or encumbrance.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent
specifically provided by the Committee with respect to a grant, (1) a
nonqualified stock option may be transferred to immediate family members or
related family trusts, or similar entities on such terms and conditions as
the Committee may establish, and (2) an Award other than an Incentive Stock
Option may be transferred pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order
described in Section 414(p) of the Code.

ii. _Term of Awards_. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the term of each Award
shall be for such period as may be determined by the Committee; provided,
that in no event shall the term of any Award exceed a period of 10 years from
the date of its grant.

iii. _Share Certificates_. All certificates for Shares or other securities of
the Company delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise
thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions
as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations,
and other requirements of the SEC, any stock exchange upon which such Shares
or other securities are then listed, and any applicable federal or state laws,
and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such
certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

 

iv. _Consideration for Grants_. Awards may be granted for no cash
consideration or for such consideration as the Committee determines
including, without limitation, such minimal cash consideration as may be
required by applicable law.

v. _Delivery of Shares or other Securities upon Payment by Participant of
Consideration_. No Shares or other securities shall be delivered pursuant to
any Award until payment in full of any amount required to be paid pursuant to
the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement is received by the Company.

vi.  _Section 409A Considerations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
the Plan to the contrary, any Award shall contain terms that (i) are designed
to avoid application of Section 409A of the Code to the Award or (ii)
are designed to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code
should that Code Section apply to the Award.

7\. _Amendment and Termination_.

Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless
otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan:

a. Amendments to the Plan. Except as required by applicable law or the rules
of the principal securities exchange or market on which the shares are traded
and subject to Section 7(b) below, the Board may amend, alter, suspend,
discontinue, or terminate the Plan without the consent of any stockholder,
Participant, other holder or beneficiary of an Award, or other Person.
Provided, however, no amendment to the Plan shall be made without the approval
of the shareholders that would increase the total number of shares available
for award under the Plan (except by operation of Section 4(c) of the Plan).

b. Amendments to Awards. Subject to (d) below, the Committee may waive any
conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter any Award theretofore
granted, provided no change, other than pursuant 



 

75  to Section 7(c), in any Award shall reduce the benefit to Participant
without the consent of such Participant. In no event shall the Committee, if
not the Board, take action without the approval of the Board that constitutes
a " _repricing_ " of an Option for financial accounting purposes, and any
Board-approved repricing shall be inoperative and ineffective unless and until
approved by the stockholders. 

c. Adjustment of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring
Events. Subject to (d) below, the Committee is hereby authorized to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in,
Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without
limitation, the events described in Section 4(c) of the Plan) affecting the
Company, any Affiliate, or the financial statements of the Company or any
Affiliate, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting
principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are
appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or
potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan.

d. Unilateral Amendments. The Committee, in its sole discretion and without
the consent of the Participant, may amend (i) any stock-based Award to reflect
(1) a change in corporate capitalization, such as a stock split or dividend,
(2) a corporate transaction, such as a corporate merger, a corporate
consolidation, any corporate separation (including a spinoff or other
distribution of stock or property by a corporation), any corporate
reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition
of such term in Section 368 of the Code), (3) any partial or complete
corporate liquidation, or (4) a change in accounting rules required by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board and (ii) any Award that is not intended
to meet the requirements of the performance based compensation exception to
Section 162(m) of the Code, to reflect a significant event that the Committee,
in its sole discretion, believes to be appropriate to reflect the original
intent in the grant of the Award. With respect to an Award that is intended to
qualify for the performance- based compensation exception to Section 162(m) of
the Code, subject to Section 8, the Committee (i) shall not take any action
that would disqualify such Award as performance based compensation and (ii)
must first certify that the Performance Objectives, if applicable, have been
achieved before the Award may be paid.

8\. _Change in Control_.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary and except as
otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, in the event of a Change in
Control of the Company, all such Awards shall become fully vested as of the
date of such Change in Control of the Company (or such earlier time as set by
the Committee), all restrictions, if any, with respect to such Awards shall
lapse, and all performance criteria, if any, with respect to such Awards
shall be deemed to have been met in full (at the highest level). Unless the
Company survives as an independent publicly traded company and unless
otherwise determined by the Board in accordance with the immediately prior
sentence, all Options outstanding at the time of the Change in Control shall
terminate and the Optionee shall be paid, with respect to each Option, an
amount in cash equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share over
the Options exercise price, unless and except to the extent provision is made
in writing in connection with such Change in Control event or transaction for
the continuation of the Plan and/or the assumption of the Options theretofore
granted, or for the substitution for such Options of new options covering the
stock of a successor entity, or the parent or subsidiary thereof, with
appropriate adjustments as to the number and kinds of shares and exercise
prices, in which event the Plan and Options theretofore granted shall
continue as fully vested and immediately exercisable Options in the manner and
under the terms so provided.

9\. _General Provisions_.

a. No Rights to Awards. No director, Employee, Consultant or other Person
shall have any claim to be granted any Award. There is no obligation for
uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards,
and the terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to
each recipient.

b. Withholding. The Company or any Affiliate is authorized to withhold from
any Award, from any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the
Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the
amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, Shares that would otherwise be 



 

76  issued pursuant to such Award, other Awards or other property) of any
applicable taxes payable in respect of an Award, its exercise, the lapse of
restrictions thereon, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under the
Plan and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the
Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. In addition,
the Committee may provide, in an Award Agreement, that the Participant shall
have the right to direct the Company to satisfy the Companys tax withholding
obligation through the "constructive" tender of already-owned Shares or the
withholding of Shares otherwise to be acquired upon the exercise or payment
of such Award.

c. No Right to Employment. The grant of an Award shall not be construed
as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company
or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss
a Participant from employment or other service relationship at any time, free
from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly
provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement.

d. Governing Law. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any
rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable federal
law. 

e. Severability. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is
deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to
any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law
deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or
deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be
construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee,
materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall
be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of
the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.

f. Other Laws. The Committee may refuse to issue or transfer any Shares or
other consideration under an Award if, acting in its sole discretion, it
determines that the issuance of transfer or such Shares or such other
consideration might violate any applicable law or regulation or entitle the
Company to recover the same under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and any
payment tendered to the Company by a Participant, other holder or beneficiary
in connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly refunded to
the relevant Participant, holder or beneficiary.

g. Unfunded Plan. Neither the Plan nor the Award shall create or be construed
to create a trust or separate fund or funds. Neither the Plan nor any Award
shall establish any kind of a fiduciary relationship between the Company or
any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any
Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate
pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any
general unsecured creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.

h. No Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered
pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether
cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu
of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights
thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated. 

i. Substitute Awards. Awards may be granted from time to time in substitution
for similar awards held by employees or directors of other corporations who
become Employees or non-employee directors of the Company or its Affiliates as
the result of a merger or consolidation of such director or employees
employing corporation with the Company or any Affiliate, or the acquisition
by the Company or any Affiliate of the assets of such director or employees
employing corporation, or the acquisition by the Company or any Affiliate of
the stock of such director or employees employing corporation. The terms and
conditions of substitute Awards granted shall comport with the terms and
conditions set forth in the Plan.

j. Shareholder Agreements. The Committee may condition the grant, exercise or
payment of any Award upon such person entering into a stockholders agreement
or repurchase agreement in such form as approved from time to time by the
Board.



 

77 k. Gender, Tense and Headings. Whenever the context requires, words of
the masculine gender used herein shall include the feminine and neuter and
words used in the singular shall include the plural. Headings are given to the
Sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate
reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant
to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.

l. No Guarantee of Tax Consequences. None of the Board, the Company nor the
Committee makes any commitment or guarantee that any federal, state or local
tax treatment will apply or be available to any person participating or
eligible to participate hereunder.

m. Section 162(m) Special Transition Rule. Should any class of Common Stock
be registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the Plan is intended to
qualify for the transition relief provided under Treasury Regulation
§1.162-27(f). Accordingly, all compensation realized by Participants in
connection with Awards granted under the Plan within the reliance period
described therein is intended to be exempt from the limitation on tax
deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code. For purposes of the Plan,
the reliance period will expire on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the
Plan, (ii) a "material modification" of the Plan (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation §1.162-27(h)(1)(iii)), (iii) the issuance of all
Common Stock that has been allocated under the Plan, or (iv) the first

81 Exhibit G

FORM OF INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is effective as of, _
_ 2009, by and among Chaparral Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and successor by merger to United Refining Energy Corp. (the " _Company_ "),
and __(the " _Indemnitee_ ").

WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually
to obligate itself to indemnify certain of its Authorized Representatives (as
defined below) of the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law so that they will serve or continue to serve as such free from undue
concern that they will not be adequately protected;

WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is willing to serve and continue to serve as an
Authorized Representative on the condition that he be so indemnified; and

WHEREAS, to the extent permitted by law, this Agreement is a supplement to and
in furtherance of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation (the "
_Certificate_ ") and bylaws of the Company (the " _Bylaws_ "), in each case
as amended from time to time, or resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and
shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any
rights of the Indemnitee thereunder; 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained
herein, the Company and the Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

1\. _Services by the Indemnitee_. The Indemnitee agrees to continue to serve
at the request of the Company as an Authorized Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee may at any time and for any
reason resign from any such position.

2\. _Indemnification General_. The Company shall indemnify, and advance
Expenses (as hereinafter defined) to, the Indemnitee as provided in this
Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in effect on
the date hereof and to such greater extent as applicable law may thereafter
from time to time permit. The rights of the Indemnitee provided under the
preceding sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the rights set
forth in the other Sections of this Agreement.

3\. _Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company_.
The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in
this _Section 3_ if, by reason of his Corporate Status (as hereinafter
defined), he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant
in any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding (as hereinafter defined),
other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company. Pursuant to this
_Section 3_, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses,
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement (as and to the
extent permitted hereunder) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his
behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter
therein, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect
to any criminal Proceeding, if he also had no reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful.

4\. _Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company_. The Indemnitee shall be
entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this  _Section 4_ if,
by reason of his Corporate Status, he is, or is threatened to be made, a party
to or participant in any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding brought
by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor.
Pursuant to this _Section 4_, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee
against Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in
connection with such Proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner
he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnification against such
Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such
Proceeding as to which the Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable
to the Company or if applicable law prohibits such indemnification; _provided_
, _however_ , that if applicable law so permits, indemnification against
Expenses shall nevertheless be made by the Company in 



 

82  such event if and to the extent that the court in which such Proceeding
shall have been brought or is pending determines that in view of all the
circumstances, the Indemnitee is reasonably and fairly entitled to such
indemnification as such court deems proper.

5\. _Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly
Successful_.

(a) To the extent that the Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate
Status, a party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any
Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection
therewith. If the Indemnitee is not wholly successful in the defense of any
Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more
but less than all of the claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the
Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with each such
claim, issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee is successful, on the merits
or otherwise. For purposes of this _Section 5(a)_, the term "successful, on
the merits or otherwise," shall include, but shall not be limited to, (i) the
termination of any claim, issue or matter in a Proceeding by withdrawal or
dismissal, with or without prejudice, (ii) the termination of any claim,
issue or matter in a Proceeding by any other means without any express finding
of liability or guilt against the Indemnitee, with or without prejudice, (iii)
the expiration of 120 days after the making of a claim or threat of
a Proceeding without the institution of the same and without any promise or
payment made to induce a settlement or (iv) the settlement of any claim, issue
or matter in a Proceeding pursuant to which the Indemnitee pays less than
$100,000. The provisions of this _Section 5(a)_ are subject to _Section
5(b)_ below.

(b) In no event shall the Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 5(a)_ above with respect to a claim, issue or matter to the extent
(i) applicable law prohibits such indemnification, or (ii) an admission is
made by the Indemnitee in writing to the Company or in such Proceeding or a
final, nonappealable determination is made in such Proceeding that the
standard of conduct required for indemnification under this Agreement has not
been met with respect to such claim, issue or matter.

6\. _Indemnification for Expenses as a Witness_. Notwithstanding any
provisions herein to the contrary, to the extent that the Indemnitee is, by
reason of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding, the Company shall
indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred
by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection therewith.

7\. _Advancement of Expenses_. The Company shall advance all reasonable
Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with any
Proceeding described herein within 10 days after the receipt by the Company of
a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or
advances from time to time, whether prior to or after the final disposition
of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the
Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee hereby
expressly undertakes to repay such amounts advanced only if, and to
the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined by a final, non-appealable
adjudication or arbitration decision that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified against such Expenses. All amounts advanced to the Indemnitee by
the Company pursuant to this _Section 7_ shall be without interest. The
Company shall make all advances pursuant to this _Section 7_ without regard
to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make repayment, without bond or
other security and without regard to the prospect of whether the Indemnitee
may ultimately be found to be entitled to indemnification under the provisions
of this Agreement. Any required reimbursement of Expenses by the Indemnitee
shall be made by the Indemnitee to the Company within 10 days following the
entry of the final, non-appealable adjudication or arbitration decision
pursuant to which it is determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified against such Expenses.

8\. _Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification._

(a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall
submit to the Company a written request therefor, along with such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to the 



 

83  Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent
the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company
shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise
the Board in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification.

(b) Upon written request by the Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the
first sentence of _Section 8(a)_ hereof, a determination, if required by
applicable law, with respect to the Indemnitees entitlement thereto shall be
made in the specific case: (i) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined); or (ii) if a
quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not
obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so
directs, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), as selected pursuant
to _Section 8(d)_, in a written opinion to the Board (which opinion may be a
"more likely than not" opinion), a copy of which shall be delivered to the
Indemnitee. If it is so determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, the Company shall make payment to the Indemnitee within 10
days after such determination. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Person
or Persons making such determination with respect to the Indemnitees
entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such Person or Persons
upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not
privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably
available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.
Subject to the provisions of _Section 10_ hereof, any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by the
Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Person or Persons making such
determination shall be borne by the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold the Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control has occurred, the
Indemnitee may require a determination with respect to the Indemnitees
entitlement to indemnification to be made by Independent Counsel, as selected
pursuant to _Section 8(d)_, in a written opinion to the Board (which opinion
may be a "more likely than not" opinion), a copy of which shall be delivered
to the Indemnitee.

(d) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be
made by Independent Counsel pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ or _(c)_ hereof, the
Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this  _Section 8(d)_.
If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall
be selected by the Board (including a vote of a majority of the Disinterested
Directors if obtainable), and the Company shall give written notice to the
Indemnitee advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so
selected. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel
shall be selected by the Indemnitee (unless the Indemnitee shall request that
such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence
shall apply), and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld). If (i) an Independent Counsel is to make the
determination of entitlement pursuant to  _Section 8(b)_ or _(c)_ hereof,
and (ii) within 20 days after submission by the Indemnitee of a written
request for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8(a)_ hereof, no Independent
Counsel shall have been selected, either the Company or the Indemnitee may
petition the appropriate court of the State (as hereafter defined) or other
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment as Independent Counsel of
a Person selected by such court or by such other Person as such court shall
designate. The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of
Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with
acting pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ or  _(c)_ hereof, and the Company shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this
_Section 8(d)_, regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel
was selected or appointed. Upon the due commencement of any judicial
proceeding or arbitration pursuant to _Section 10(a)(iv)_ of this Agreement,
Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further
responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of
professional conduct then prevailing).

9\. _Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings; Construction of Certain
Phrases._

(a) In making a determination with respect to whether the Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification hereunder, the reviewing party making such
determination shall presume that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement if the Indemnitee has submitted a request for
indemnification in 



 

84  accordance with _Section 8(a)_ of this Agreement, and anyone seeking to
overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of
persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence.

(b) Subject to the terms of _Section 15_ below, the termination of any
Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order,
settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its
equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to
indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in
good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any
criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was unlawful.

(c) For purposes of any determination of the Indemnitees entitlement to
indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, the Indemnitee shall be
deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect
to a criminal Proceeding, to have also had no reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful, if the Indemnitees action is based on the records or
books of account of the Company or another enterprise, including financial
statements, or on information supplied to the Indemnitee by the officers of
the Company or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the
advice of legal or financial counsel for the Company or the Board (or any
committee thereof) or for another enterprise or its board of directors (or any
committee thereof), or on information or records given or reports made by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other
expert selected by the Company or the Board (or any committee thereof) or by
another enterprise or its board of directors (or any committee thereof). For
purposes of this _Section 9(c)_, the term "another enterprise" means any
other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which the Indemnitee is or
was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or
agent. The provisions of this _Section 9(c)_ shall not be deemed to be
exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the
Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in this Agreement. In addition, the knowledge and/or
actions, or failure to act, of any other director, trustee, partner, managing
member, fiduciary, officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not be
imputed to the Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right
to indemnification under this Agreement. Whether or not the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 9(c)_ are satisfied, it shall in any event be
presumed that the Indemnitee has acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Company, and, with respect to a criminal Proceeding, that he also had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Anyone seeking to
overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of
persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, references to "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit
plan; references to "serving at the request of the Company" shall include, but
shall not be limited to, any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by, the
Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or its
beneficiaries; and if the Indemnitee has acted in good faith and in a manner
he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan, he shall be deemed to have acted in
a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Company" as used in
this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 9(d)_ shall not be deemed to
be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the
Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in this Agreement.

10\. _Remedies of the Indemnitee_.

(a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to _Section 8_ of
this Agreement that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to
_Section 7_ of this Agreement, (iii) the determination of entitlement to
indemnification is to be made by the Board pursuant to _Section 8(b)_ of
this Agreement and such determination shall not have been made and delivered
to the Indemnitee in writing within twenty (20) days 



 

85  after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) the
determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent
Counsel pursuant to  _Section 8(b)_ or _(c)_ of this Agreement and such
determination shall not have been made in a written opinion to the Board and a
copy delivered to the Indemnitee within forty-five (45) days after receipt by
the Company of the request for indemnification, (v) payment of
indemnification is not made pursuant to _Section 6_ of this Agreement within
10 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor or (vi)
payment of indemnification is not made within 10 days after a determination
has been made that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or such
determination is deemed to have been made pursuant to _Section 8_ or _9_ of
this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an
appropriate court of the State of his entitlement to such indemnification or
advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, the Indemnitee, at his sole option,
may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator
pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Indemnitee
shall commence such Proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in
arbitration within 180 days following the date on which the Indemnitee first
has the right to commence such Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 10(a)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect
of a Proceeding brought by the Indemnitee to enforce his rights under _Section
5_ of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that a determination is made pursuant to _Section 8_ of
this Agreement that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any
judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this _Section 10_
shall be conducted in all respects as a _de novo_ trial or a _de novo_
arbitration (as applicable) on the merits, and the Indemnitee shall not be
prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding
or arbitration commenced pursuant to this _Section 10_, the Company shall
have the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification, and the Company shall be precluded from referring to or
offering into evidence a determination made pursuant to _Section 8_ of this
Agreement that is adverse to the Indemnitees right to indemnification. If
the Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this
_Section 10_, the Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company
for any advances pursuant to  _Section 7_ until a final determination is
made with respect to the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification (as to
which rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed).

(c) If a determination is made or deemed to have been made pursuant to
_Section 8_ or _9_ of this Agreement that the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any
judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this _Section 10_,
absent (i) a misstatement by the Indemnitee of a material fact, or an
omission by the Indemnitee of a material fact necessary to make the
Indemnitees statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such
indemnification under applicable law.

(d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding
or arbitration commenced pursuant to this _Section 10_ that the procedures
and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and
shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the
Company is bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) In the event that the Indemnitee, pursuant to this  _Section 10_, seeks
a judicial adjudication or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights
under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, the Indemnitee
shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by
the Company against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
him in such judicial adjudication or arbitration, unless the court or
arbitrator determines that each of the Indemnitees claims in such Proceeding
were made in bad faith or were frivolous. In the event that a Proceeding is
commenced by or in the right of the Company against the Indemnitee to enforce
or interpret any of the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company
against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in such
Proceeding (including with respect to any counter-claims or cross-claims made
by the Indemnitee against the Company in such Proceeding), unless the court
or arbitrator determines that each of the Indemnitees material defenses in
such Proceeding were made in bad faith or were frivolous.



 

86 (f) Any judicial adjudication or arbitration determined under this  _Section
10_ shall be final and binding on the parties.

11\. _Defense of Certain Proceedings._ In the event the Company shall be
obligated under this Agreement to pay Expenses incurred in connection with any
Proceeding against the Indemnitee in which the Company is a co-defendant with
the Indemnitee, the Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of
such Proceeding, with counsel approved by the Indemnitee, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, upon the delivery to the Indemnitee of
written notice of its election to do so. After delivery of such notice,
approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel
by the Company, the Indemnitee shall nevertheless be entitled to employ or
continue to employ his own counsel in such Proceeding. Employment of such
counsel by the Indemnitee shall be at the cost and expense of the Company
unless and until the Company shall have demonstrated to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Indemnitee and the Indemnitees counsel that there is
complete identity of issues and defenses and no conflict of interest
between the Company and the Indemnitee in such Proceeding, after which time
further employment of such counsel by the Indemnitee shall be at the cost and
expense of the Indemnitee. In all events, if the Company shall not, in fact,
have timely employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then
the fees and Expenses of the Indemnitees counsel shall be at the cost and
expense of the Company.

12. _Exception to Right of Indemnification or Advancement of Expenses_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Agreement with respect to any Proceeding, or any claim therein, brought or made by the Indemnitee against: 

(a) the Company, except for (i) any claim or Proceeding in respect of this
Agreement and/or the Indemnitees rights hereunder, (ii) any claim or
Proceeding to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under any
statute or law and (iii) any counter-claim or cross-claim brought or made by
him against the Company in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the
Company against him; or

(b) any other Person, except for Proceedings or claims approved by the Board.

13\. _Contribution._

(a) If, with respect to any Proceeding, the indemnification provided for in
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable
to the Indemnitee for any reason other than that the Indemnitee did not act
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to a criminal
Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful, the Company shall contribute to the amount of Expenses,
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on his behalf in connection with such
Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnitee and
the relative fault of the Indemnitee versus the other defendants or
participants in connection with the action or inaction which resulted in such
Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations.

(b) The Company and the Indemnitee agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 13_ were determined by
pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in
_Section 13(a)_ above.

(c) No Person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) shall be entitled
to contribution from any Person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

14\. _Officer and Director Liability Insurance_.

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
maintain in effect during the entire period for which the Company is
obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement, one or more
policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies to provide the
directors and officers of the 



 

87  Company with coverage for losses from wrongful acts and omissions and to
ensure the Companys performance of its indemnification obligations under this
Agreement. In all such insurance policies, the Indemnitee shall be named as
an insured in such a manner as to provide the Indemnitee with the same rights
and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Companys
directors and officers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have
no obligation to obtain or maintain such insurance if the Company determines
in good faith that the Indemnitee is covered by such insurance maintained by a
subsidiary or parent of the Company.

(b) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies
providing liability insurance for directors or officers of any other
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise which the Indemnitee serves at the
request of the Company, the Indemnitee shall be named as an insured under and
shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their
terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for the most favorably
insured director or officer under such policy or policies.

(c) In the event that the Company is a named insured under any policy or
policies of insurance referenced in either  _Section 14(a)_ or _(b)_ above,
the Company hereby covenants and agrees that it will not settle any claims or
Proceedings that may be covered by such policy or policies of insurance and in
which the Indemnitee has or may incur Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines
or amounts paid in settlement without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably withheld).

15\. _Security._ In the event the Indemnitee reasonably believes that the
Company has insufficient insurance coverage to meet its obligations to the
Indemnitee under this Agreement, and at the request of the Indemnitee, the
Company shall provide security to the Indemnitee for the Companys obligations
hereunder through an irrevocable bank letter of credit, funded trust or other
similar collateral. Any such security, once provided to the Indemnitee, may
not be revoked or released without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, which consent may be granted or withheld at the Indemnitees sole
and absolute discretion.

16\. _Settlement of Claims_. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the
Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any
Proceeding effected without the Companys written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

17\. _Duration of Agreement_. This Agreement shall be unaffected by the
termination of the Corporate Status of the Indemnitee and shall continue for
so long as the Indemnitee may have any liability or potential liability by
virtue of his Corporate Status, including, without limitation, the final
termination of all pending Proceedings in respect of which the Indemnitee is
granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of
any Proceeding commenced by the Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 10_ of this
Agreement relating thereto, whether or not he is acting or serving in such
capacity at the time any liability or Expense is incurred for which
indemnification can be provided under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and the successors of the Company (including any direct or indirect
successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or
substantially all of the business or assets of the Company). Indemnification
hereunder shall be a personal right, and the Company shall have no liability
under this Agreement to any insurer or any person, corporation, partnership,
association, trust or other entity (other than the heirs, executors or
administrators of such person) by reason of subrogation, assignment or
succession, or by any other means, to the claim of any person to
indemnification hereunder.

18\. _Remedies of the Company._ The Company hereby covenants and agrees to
submit any and all disputes relating to this Agreement that the parties are
unable to resolve between themselves to binding arbitration pursuant to the
rules of the American Arbitration Association and waives all rights to
judicial adjudication of any matter or dispute relating to this Agreement
except where judicial adjudication is requested or required by the
Indemnitee.

19\. _Covenant Not to Sue, Limitation of Actions and Release of Claims_. No
legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or
on behalf of the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) against the 



 

88  Indemnitee, his spouse, heirs, executors, personal representatives or
administrators after the expiration of two (2) years from the date of the
cause of action (or, in the event such cause of action is not readily
discernable, two (2) years after discovery of such cause of action by the
Company using reasonable diligence), and any claim or cause of action of the
Company (or any of its subsidiaries) shall be extinguished and deemed
released unless asserted by filing of a legal action within such two-year
period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any
action or cause of action brought or asserted by the Company pursuant to or
in respect of this Agreement and shall not constitute a waiver or release of
any of the Companys rights under this Agreement.

20\. _Limitation of Liability._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither party shall have any liability to the other for, and
neither party shall be entitled to recover from the other, any consequential,
special, punitive, multiple or exemplary damages as a result of a breach of
this Agreement.

21\. _Subrogation._ In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the
Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights
of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take
all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such
documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such
rights.

22\. _No Multiple Recovery._ The Company shall not be liable under this
Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if
and to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such
payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.

purpose any new director whose election or nomination for election by the
Companys shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the

be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate, the Bylaws, any agreement,
a vote of stockholders, a resolution of directors or otherwise. 

25\. _Remedies Not Exclusive_. No right or remedy herein conferred upon the
Indemnitee is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and
every other right or remedy shall be cumulative of and in addition to the
rights and remedies given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy of
the Indemnitee hereunder or otherwise shall not be deemed an election of
remedies on the part of the Indemnitee and shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other right or remedy by the Indemnitee.

26\. _Changes in Law._ In the event that a change in applicable law after the
date of this Agreement, whether by statute, rule or judicial decision,
expands or otherwise increases the right or ability of a Delaware corporation

shall, by this Agreement, enjoy the greater benefits so afforded by
such change. In the event that a change in applicable law after the date of
this Agreement, whether by statute, rule or judicial decision, narrows or

effect on this Agreement or any of the Indemnitees rights hereunder, except
and only to the extent required by law.

held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a)
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this
Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; (b) such
provision or provisions will be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to
conform to applicable law and to give maximum effect to the intent of
the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be
construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision or
provisions held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

29\. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; Specific Performance._

(a) The parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

(b) ANY "ACTION OR PROCEEDING" (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED BELOW) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE FILED IN AND LITIGATED OR ARBITRATED

THE STATE OF RESIDENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE, AND EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT: (i) GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY ACCEPTS THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS AND ARBITRATORS AND VENUE THEREIN, AND
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW ANY DEFENSE OR OBJECTION TO SUCH
JURISDICTION AND VENUE BASED UPON THE DOCTRINE OF "FORUM NON CONVENIENS;" AND
(ii) GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY DELIVERY OF CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAILING OF THE
SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NOTICE PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM " _ACTION OR PROCEEDING_ "
IS DEFINED AS ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, SUITS, ACTIONS, HEARINGS, ARBITRATIONS OR
OTHER SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING APPEALS AND PETITIONS THEREFROM, WHETHER
FORMAL OR INFORMAL, GOVERNMENTAL OR NON-GOVERNMENTAL, OR CIVIL OR CRIMINAL.
THE FOREGOING CONSENT TO JURISDICTION SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE GENERAL CONSENT TO
SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE STATE FOR ANY PURPOSE EXCEPT AS PROVIDED ABOVE, AND
SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO CONFER RIGHTS ON ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE PARTIES TO
THIS AGREEMENT.

(c) The Company acknowledges that the Indemnitee may, as a result of the
Companys breach of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement,
sustain immediate and long-term substantial and irreparable injury and damage
which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by damages at law.
Consequently, the Company agrees that the Indemnitee shall be entitled, in the
event of the Companys breach or threatened breach of its covenants and
obligations hereunder, to obtain equitable relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction, including enforcement of each provision of this Agreement by
specific performance and/or temporary, preliminary and/or permanent
injunctions enforcing any of the Indemnitees rights, requiring performance
by the Company, or enjoining any breach by the Company, all without proof of
any actual damages that have been or may be caused to the Indemnitee by such
breach or threatened breach and without the posting of bond or other security
in connection therewith. The Company waives the 



 

91  claim or defense therein that the Indemnitee has an adequate remedy at law,
and the Company shall not allege or otherwise assert the legal position that
any such remedy at law exists.

 

30\. _Nondisclosure of Payments._ Except as expressly required by Federal
securities laws, the Company shall not disclose any payments under this

unreasonably withheld). Any payments to the Indemnitee that must be disclosed
shall, unless otherwise required by law, be described only in the
Company proxy or information statements relating to special and/or annual
meetings of the Companys shareholders, and the Company shall afford the
Indemnitee a reasonable opportunity to review all such disclosures and, if
requested by the Indemnitee, to explain in such statement any mitigating
circumstances regarding the events reported.

31\. _Notice by the Indemnitee_. The Indemnitee agrees to promptly notify the
Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena,
complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any
Proceeding or matter which may be subject to indemnification or advancement
of Expenses covered hereunder.

32\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given if (a) delivered by hand and received for by the party to whom said

33\. _Modification and Waiver_. No supplement, modification or amendment of
this Agreement or any provision hereof shall limit or restrict in any way any
right of the Indemnitee under this Agreement with respect to any action taken
or omitted by the Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to such supplement,
modification or amendment. No supplement, modification or amendment of this
Agreement or any provision hereof shall be binding unless executed in writing
by both of the Company and the Indemnitee. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a wavier of any other provision
hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing
waiver.

34.  _Headings_. The headings of the Sections or paragraphs of this Agreement
are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part
of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof.

35\. _Gender_. Use of the masculine pronoun in this Agreement shall be deemed
to include usage of the feminine pronoun where appropriate.

36\. _Identical Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (whether by original, photocopy or facsimile signature), each of
which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Only one such
counterpart executed by the party against whom enforcement is sought must be

conflict between the provisions of these Bylaws and the mandatory provisions
of the DGCL or the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, such

a. Annual Meetings. An annual meeting of the Corporations stockholders (the "
_ _Stockholders__ ") shall be held each calendar year for the purposes of (i)
electing directors as provided in Article III and (ii) transacting such other
business as may properly be brought before the meeting. Each annual meeting

office, which request or resolution shall fix the date, time and place, and
state the purpose or purposes, of the proposed meeting. Except as provided by
applicable law, these Bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation, Stockholders
shall not be entitled to call a special meeting of Stockholders or to require
the Board of Directors or any officer to call such a meeting or to propose
business at such a meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting of
Stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice or waivers
of notice of such meeting.



 

94 c. Place of Meetings. The Board of Directors may designate the place of
meeting (either within or without the State of Delaware) for any meeting of
Stockholders. If no designation is made by the Board of Directors, the place
of meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation.
In addition, the Board of Directors may determine that the meeting shall not
be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote
communications as authorized by these Bylaws.

d. Notice of Meetings.

i. Written notice of each meeting of Stockholders shall be delivered to each
Stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat, which notice shall (i) state
the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote
communications, if any, by which Stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at any such meeting and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and
(ii) be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the
meeting.

ii. Each notice of a meeting of Stockholders shall be given as provided in
Section 9.1, except that if no address appears on the Corporations books or
stock transfer records with respect to any Stockholder, notice to such
Stockholder shall be deemed to have been given if sent by first-class mail or
telecommunication to the Corporations principal executive office or if
published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
where such principal executive office is located.

iii. If any notice addressed to a Stockholder at the address of such
Stockholder appearing on the books of the Corporation is returned to the
Corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the
United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the
Stockholder at such address, all further notices to such Stockholder at such
address shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if
the same shall be available to such Stockholder upon written demand of such
Stockholder at the principal executive office of the Corporation for a period
of one year from the date of the giving of such notice.

iv. Any previously scheduled meeting of the Stockholders may be postponed
by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the

Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation who has charge of the
Corporations stock ledger shall prepare a complete list of the Stockholders
entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing,
with respect to each Stockholder, his address and the number of shares
registered in his name. __ Such list shall be open to the examination of any
Stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business
hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. If the list is made available on an electronic
network, then the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that
such information is available only to Stockholders. If the meeting is to held
at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any Stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any
Stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonable accessible
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be
provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger of the Corporation
shall be the only evidence as to who are the Stockholders entitled to examine
any list required by this Section 2.5 or to vote in person or by proxy at any
meeting of Stockholders and the number of shares held by them.

f. Quorum and Adjournment. The holders of a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors (the " _ _Voting Stock__ "), present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of
Stockholders, except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws. If a quorum is present at any meeting of
Stockholders, such quorum shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough
Stockholders to leave less than a quorum and the Stockholders may continue to
transact business until adjournment, provided that any action taken 



 

95  (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares
required to constitute a quorum. If a quorum shall not be present at any
meeting of Stockholders, the holders of a majority of the voting stock
represented at such meeting or, if no Stockholder entitled to vote is present
at such meeting, any officer of the Corporation may adjourn such meeting from
time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notwithstanding anything in
these Bylaws to the contrary, the chairman of any meeting of Stockholders
shall have the right, acting in his sole discretion, to adjourn such meeting
from time to time.

g. Adjourned Meetings. When a meeting of Stockholders is adjourned to another
time or place, unless otherwise provided by these Bylaws, notice need not be
given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting,
are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; _provided,
however_ , if an adjournment is for more than 30 days or if after an
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Stockholder entitled to vote
thereat. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present in person
or by proxy, the Stockholders entitled to vote thereat may transact any
business which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
noticed.

h. Voting.

i. Election of directors at all meetings of Stockholders shall be by written
ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation; if
authorized by the Board of Directors, such requirement of a written ballot
shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission, provided
that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted
with information from which it can determined that electronic transmission was
authorized by the Stockholder or proxy holder. Except as otherwise provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality
of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Except as otherwise
provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
all matters other than the election of directors submitted to the
Stockholders at any meeting shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by
proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Except as otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, (i) no
Stockholder shall have any right of cumulative voting and (ii) each
outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each
matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of Stockholders.

ii. Shares standing in the name of another corporation (whether domestic or
foreign) may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such
corporation may prescribe or, in the absence of such provision, as the board
of directors of such corporation may determine. Shares standing in the name
of a deceased person may be voted by the executor, personal representative or
administrator of such deceased person, either in person or by proxy. Shares
standing in the name of a guardianship, conservatorship or trust may be voted
by the appropriate fiduciary, either in person or by proxy, but no fiduciary
shall be entitled to vote shares held in such fiduciary capacity without a
transfer of such shares into the name of such fiduciary. Shares standing in
the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver. A Stockholder whose
shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares, unless in the
transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation he has expressly
empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee (or his
proxy) may represent the stock and vote thereon.

iii. If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the
name of two or more persons (whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership,
joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise) or if
two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same
shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is
furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating
the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting
shall have the following effect:

(1) if only one votes, his act binds all;



 

96 (2) if more than one votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; and 

(3) if more than one votes but the vote is evenly split on any particular
matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionately or
any person voting the shares, or a beneficiary, (if any) may apply to the
Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court as may have jurisdiction to
appoint an additional person to act with the person so voting the shares,
which shall then be voted as determined by a majority such persons and the
person so appointed by the court.

If the instrument so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal
interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of the paragraph (c) shall
be a majority or even-split in interest.

i. Proxies

i. At any meeting of Stockholders, each Stockholder having the right to vote
thereat may be represented and vote either in person or by proxy executed in
writing by such Stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. Each
such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation at or before
the beginning of each meeting at which such proxy is to be voted. Unless
otherwise provided therein, no proxy shall be valid after three years from the
date of its execution. Each proxy shall be revocable unless expressly
provided therein to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest sufficient in
law to support an irrevocable power or unless otherwise made irrevocable by
applicable law.

ii. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the Stockholders name is placed on the
proxy (whether by manual signature, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by
the Stockholder or his attorney-in-fact. In the event any proxy shall
designate two or more persons to act as proxies, a majority of such persons
present at the meeting (or, if only one shall be present, then that one)
shall have and may exercise all the powers conferred by the proxy upon all the
persons so designated unless the proxy shall otherwise provide.

iii. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may, in advance of
any meeting of Stockholders, prescribe additional regulations concerning the
manner of execution and filing of proxies (and the validation of same) which
may be voted at such meeting.

j. Record Date. For the purpose of determining the Stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of Stockholders (or any adjournment
thereof) or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or
allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by
the Board of Directors or be more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to the
date of such meeting nor more than 60 days prior to any other action. If no
record date is fixed, (i) the record date for determining Stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held and (ii) the record date for determining
Stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A
determination of Stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of Stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; 
_provided, however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date
for the adjourned meeting.

k. Conduct of Meetings; Agenda

i. Meetings of the Stockholders shall be presided over by the officer of the
Corporation whose duties under these Bylaws require him to do so; _provided,
however_ , if no such officer of the Corporation shall be present at any
meeting of Stockholders, such meeting shall be presided over by a chairman to
be chosen by a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at
the meeting who are present in person or by proxy. At each meeting of
Stockholders, the officer of the Corporation whose duties under these Bylaws 



 

97  require him to do so shall act as secretary of the meeting; _provided,
however_ , if no such officer of the Corporation shall be present at any
meeting of Stockholders, the chairman of such meeting shall appoint a
secretary. The order of business at each meeting of Stockholders shall be as
determined by the chairman of the meeting, including such regulation of the
manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him in order. 

ii. The Board of Directors may, in advance of any meeting of Stockholders,
adopt an agenda for such meeting, adherence to which the chairman of the
meeting may enforce.

l. Inspectors of Election; Opening and Closing of Polls. 

i. Before any meeting of Stockholders, the Board of Directors may, and if
required by law shall, appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of
election at such meeting or any adjournment thereof. If any person appointed
as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the
meeting may, and if required by law or requested by any Stockholder entitled
to vote or his proxy shall, appoint a substitute inspector. If no inspectors
are appointed by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting may, and
if required by law or requested by any Stockholder entitled to vote or his
proxy shall, appoint one or more inspectors at the meeting. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, inspectors shall be appointed consistent with the mandatory
provisions of Section 231 of the DGCL.

ii. Inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other
capacities (including as officers, employees, agents or representatives);
_provided, however_ , that no director or candidate for the office of director
shall act as an inspector. Inspectors need not be Stockholders.

iii. The inspectors shall (i) determine the number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of
shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the validity
and effect of proxies and (ii) receive votes or ballots, hear and determine
all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote,
count and tabulate all votes and ballots, determine the results and do such
acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all
Stockholders. On request of the chairman of the meeting, the inspectors
shall make a report in writing of any challenge, request or matter determined
by them and shall execute a certificate of any fact found by them. The
inspectors shall have such other duties as may be prescribed by Section 231 of
the DGCL.

 

iv. The chairman of the meeting may, and if required by the DGCL shall, fix
and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing
of the polls for each matter upon which the Stockholders will vote at the
meeting.

m. Procedures for Bringing Business before Annual Meetings.

i. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at an annual meeting of Stockholders except in accordance
with the procedures hereinafter set forth in this Section 2.13; _provided,
however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.13 shall be deemed to preclude
discussion by any Stockholder of any business properly brought before any
annual meeting of Stockholders in accordance with such procedures.

ii. At any annual meeting of Stockholders, only such business shall be
conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be
properly brought before an annual meeting, business (other than business
relating to any nomination of directors, which is governed by Section 3.6)
must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto)
given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any
duly authorized committee thereof), (ii) otherwise properly brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of the chairman of the meeting or Board of
Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (iii) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a Stockholder of record entitled to
vote in the election of directors generally, in compliance with the provisions
of this Section 2.13 and a proper subject to be brought before such meeting.
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly
brought before an annual meeting by a Stockholder (other than business
relating to any nomination 



 

98  of directors, which is governed by Section 3.6), the Stockholder must have
given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a
Stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the
principal executive office of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the 120th day and not sooner than the close of business on the
180th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding years
annual meeting; _provided, however_ , that if no annual meeting was held in
the previous year or the date of the annual meeting of Stockholders has been
changed by more than 30 calendar days from the date contemplated at the time
of the previous years proxy statement, the notice must be received by the
Corporation not later than the later of the close of business on the 120th day
prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding years
annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement
of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. Any meeting of
Stockholders which is adjourned and will reconvene within 30 days after the
meeting date as originally noticed shall, for purposes of any Stockholders
notice contemplated by this paragraph (b), be deemed to be a continuation of
the original meeting, and no business may be brought before such adjourned
meeting by any Stockholder unless timely notice of such business was given to
the Secretary of the Corporation for the meeting as originally noticed. In no
event shall the public disclosure of an adjournment of an annual meeting of
Stockholders constitute a new time period for the giving of a Stockholders
notice as described above.

iii. Each notice given by a Stockholder as contemplated by paragraph (b)
above other than a proposed nomination of any person for election or
reelection as a director (which is addressed in Section 3.6) shall set forth,
as to each matter the Stockholder proposes to bring before the annual
meeting: (i) the nature of the proposed business with reasonable
particularity, including the exact text of any proposal to be presented for
adoption and any supporting statement, which proposal and supporting statement
shall not in the aggregate exceed 500 words, and his reasons for conducting
such business at the annual meeting; (ii) any material interest of the
Stockholder in such business; (iii) the name, principal occupation and record
address of the Stockholder; (iv) the class and number of shares of the
Corporation which are held of record or beneficially owned by the Stockholder;
(v) the dates upon which the Stockholder acquired such shares of stock and
documentary support for any claims of beneficial ownership; and (vi) such
other matters as may be required by the Certificate of Incorporation.

iv. The foregoing right of a Stockholder to propose business for consideration
at an annual meeting of Stockholders shall be subject to such conditions,
restrictions and limitations as may be imposed by the Certificate of
Incorporation. Nothing in this Section 2.13 shall entitle any Stockholder to
propose business for consideration at any special meeting of Stockholders.

v. The chairman of any meeting of Stockholders shall determine whether
business has been properly brought before the meeting and, if the facts so
warrant, may refuse to transact any business at such meeting which has not
been properly brought before the meeting.

vi. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws, the Corporation
shall be under no obligation to include any Stockholder proposal in its proxy
statement or otherwise present any such proposal to Stockholders at a meeting
of Stockholders if the Board of Directors reasonably believes that the
proponents thereof have not complied with Sections 13 and 14 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _ _Exchange Act__ "), and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Corporation shall not be
required to include in its proxy statement to Stockholders any Stockholder
proposal not required to be included in its proxy statement to Stockholders in
accordance with the Exchange Act and such rules or regulations.

vii. Nothing in this Section 2.13 shall be deemed to affect any rights of
Stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.

viii. Reference is made to Section 3.6 for procedures relating to the
nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director of the
Corporation.

Board of Directors  Powers, Number, Nominations,

Resignations, Removal, Vacancies and Compensation

a. Management. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by
and under the direction of the Board of Directors.

b. Number. The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time
exclusively by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in
office, but shall consist of not less than three (3) nor more than thirteen
(13) directors, subject, however, to increases above thirteen (13) members as
may be required in order to permit the holders of any series of preferred
stock issued by the Corporation to elect directors under specified
circumstances. Subject to the preceding sentence, the maximum number of
directors may not be increased by the Board of Directors to exceed thirteen
(13) without the affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of the members of the entire
Board of Directors.

c. Qualification. A director need not be a Stockholder or a resident of the
State of Delaware. Each director must have attained twenty-one (21) years of
age.

d. Classes of Directors. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances,
the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class
I, Class II and Class III. The number of directors in each class shall be the
whole number contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the
authorized number of directors by three, and if a fraction is also contained
in such quotient then if such fraction is one-third (1/3), the extra director
shall be a member of Class I, and if the fraction is two-thirds (2/3), one of
the extra directors shall be a member of Class I and the other member of
Class II. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of
directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue
as a director of the class of which he is a member and (ii) the newly created
or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be
apportioned by the Board of Directors among the three classes of directors so
as to ensure that no one class has more than one director more than any other
class. To the extent possible, consistent with the foregoing rule, any newly
created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office
are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation, and any newly
eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of
office are to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless
otherwise provided from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board
of Directors.

e. Election; Term of Office.

i. Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and Sections 3.9 and 3.10 of
these Bylaws, each director elected at an annual meeting of Stockholders to
succeed a director whose term is expiring shall hold office until the third
annual meeting of Stockholders after his election or until his successor is
elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal;
_provided, however_ , the term of office of directors initially appointed to
Class I shall expire at the annual meeting of Stockholders in 2009, the term
of office of directors initially appointed to Class II shall expire at the
annual meeting of Stockholders in 2010 and the term of office of directors
initially appointed to Class III shall expire at the annual meeting of
Stockholders in 2011. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the
contrary, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of
preferred stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting,
separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual meeting or the
election, term or office, filling of vacancies and other features of such
directorships shall be governed by the Certificate of Incorporation applicable
thereto.

ii. Directors shall be elected by Stockholders only at annual meetings of
Stockholders, except that if any such annual meeting is not held or if any
director to be elected thereat is not elected, such director may be elected at
any special meeting of Stockholders held for that purpose.

iii. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the number of
directors then in office shall have the effect of shortening the term of any
incumbent director.



 

100 h. Nominations

i. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, only persons who
are nominated in accordance with the procedures hereinafter set forth in this
Section 3.6 shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation.

ii. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors at a meeting
of Stockholders may be made only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or (ii) by any Stockholder entitled to vote for the election
of directors at the meeting who satisfies the eligibility requirements (if
any) set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in this Section 3.6 and in the Certificate of
Incorporation;  _provided, however_ , Stockholders may not nominate persons
for election to the Board of Directors at any special meeting of Stockholders
unless the business to be transacted at such special meeting, as set forth in
the notice of such meeting, includes the election of directors. Nominations
by Stockholders shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the
Secretary. To be timely, a Stockholders notice given in the context of an
annual meeting of Stockholders shall be delivered to or mailed and received
at the principal executive office of the Corporation not later than the close
of business on the 120th day and not sooner than the close of business on the
180th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding years
annual meeting; _provided, however_ , that if no annual meeting was held in
the previous year or the date of the annual meeting of Stockholders has been
changed by more than 30 calendar days from the date contemplated at the time
of the previous years proxy statement, the notice must be received by the
Corporation not later than the later of the close of business on the 120th day
prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding years
annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement
of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. To be timely, a

day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date
of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors
to be elected at such special meeting. For purposes of the foregoing, "public
announcement" means the disclosure in a press release reported by the PR
Newswire, Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national
news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act. Any meeting of Stockholders which is adjourned and will
reconvene within 30 days after the meeting date as originally noticed shall,
for purposes of any notice contemplated by this paragraph (b), be deemed to be
a continuation of the original meeting and no nominations by a Stockholder of
persons to be elected directors of the Corporation may be made at any such
reconvened meeting other than pursuant to a notice that was timely for the
meeting on the date originally noticed.

iii. Each notice given by a Stockholder as contemplated by paragraph (b) above
shall set forth the following information, in addition to any other
information or matters required by the Certificate of Incorporation:

(1) as to each person whom the Stockholder proposes to nominate for election
or re-election as a director, (A) the exact name of such person, (B) such
persons age, principal occupation, business address and telephone number and
residence address and telephone number, (C) the number of shares (if any) of
each class of stock of the Corporation owned directly or indirectly by such
person and (D) all other information relating to such person that is required
to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors
pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or any successor regulation
thereto (including such persons notarized written acceptance of such
nomination, consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and
statement of intention to serve as a director if elected);

(2) as to the Stockholder giving the notice, (A) his name and address, as
they appear on the Corporations books, (B) his principal occupation, business
address and telephone number and residence address and telephone number, (C)
the class and number of shares of the Corporation which 



 

101  are held of record or beneficially owned by him and (D) the dates upon which
he acquired such shares of stock and documentary support for any claims of
beneficial ownership; and

 

(3) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
Stockholder giving the notice and each nominee and any other person or
persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or
nominations are to be made by such Stockholder.

At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of
Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the
Corporation that information required to be set forth in a Stockholders
notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee.

iv. The foregoing right of a Stockholder to nominate a person for election or
reelection to the Board of Directors shall be subject to such conditions,
restrictions and limitations as may be imposed by the Certificate of
Incorporation.

v. Nothing in this Section 3.6 shall be deemed to affect any rights of
Stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.

vi. The chairman of a meeting of Stockholders shall have the power and duty
to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 3.6 and, if any nomination is not in compliance with
this Section 3.6, to declare that such defective nomination shall be
disregarded.

i. Resignations. Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the Board of Directors or the Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect
at the date of receipt of such notice or at any later time specified therein.
Acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
When one or more directors shall resign from the Board of Directors,
effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office,
excluding those who have so resigned, shall have the power to fill such
vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation
or resignations shall become effective, and each Director so chosen shall hold
office for the unexpired portion of the term of the Director whose place shall
be vacated and until his successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified.

j. Removal. No director may be removed before the expiration of his term of
office except for cause and then only by the affirmative vote of the holders
of not less than a majority of the voting power of all outstanding Voting
Stock, voting together as a single class. The Board of Directors may not
remove any director, and no recommendation by the Board of Directors that a
director be removed may be made to the Stockholders unless such recommendation
is set forth in a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than
66 2/3% of the number of directors then in office. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, whenever the holders of any class or series of preferred stock
are entitled to elect one or more directors by the Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of such class or series may remove such director(s)
with or without cause before the expiration of his term of office by the
affirmative vote of holders of not less than a majority of all outstanding
shares of such class or series of preferred stock.

k. Vacancies.

i. In case any vacancy shall occur on the Board of Directors because of death,
resignation or removal, such vacancy may be filled by a majority of the
directors remaining in office (though less than a quorum) or by the sole
remaining director. The director so appointed shall serve for the unexpired
term of his predecessor or until his successor is elected and qualified or
until his earlier death, resignation or removal. If there are no
directors then in office, an election of directors may be held in the manner
provided by applicable law.

ii. Any newly created directorship resulting from any increase in the number
of directors constituting the total number of directors which the Corporation
would have if there were no vacancies may be filled by a majority of the
directors then in office (though less than a quorum), or by the sole
remaining director. Each director so appointed shall hold office until his
successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or
removal.



 

102 iii. Except as expressly provided in these Bylaws or the Certificate
of Incorporation or as otherwise provided by law, Stockholders shall not have
any right to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly created
directorships.

iv. If, as a result of a disaster or emergency (as determined in good faith by
the then remaining directors), it becomes impossible to ascertain whether or
not vacancies exist on the Board of Directors and a person is or persons are
elected by the directors, who in good faith believe themselves to be a
majority of the remaining directors, or the sole remaining director, to fill
a vacancy or vacancies that such remaining directors in good faith believe
exists, then the acts of such person or persons who are so elected as
directors shall be valid and binding upon the Corporation, although it
may subsequently develop that at the time of the election (i) there was in
fact no vacancy or vacancies existing on the Board of Directors or (ii) the
directors, or the sole remaining director, who so elected such person or
persons did not in fact constitute a majority of the remaining directors.

l. Subject to Rights of Holders of Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Article III, if the resolutions of the Board of
Directors creating any series of preferred stock of the Corporation entitle
the holders of such preferred stock, voting separately by series, to elect
additional directors under specified circumstances, then all provisions of
such resolutions relating to the nomination, election, term of office,
removal, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall,
as to such directorships, govern and control over any conflicting provisions
of this Article III.

m. Compensation. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix, and
from time to time to change, the compensation of directors. Each director
shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Corporation for his reasonable
expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof) and meetings of the Stockholders. Nothing contained in
these Bylaws shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any
other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or
standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending such
meetings.

of the capital stock of the Corporation. If certified, certificates for shares
of stock of the

Directors, except that a certificate shall not be in bearer form. The
certificates shall be signed (i) by the Chairman of the Board (if any), the
President or a Vice President and (ii) by the Secretary, an Assistant
Secretary, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer.

restrictions of the shares represented by such certificates) as the Board
of Directors deems appropriate in connection with the requirements of federal
or state securities laws or other applicable laws.

Secretary and the Treasurer each may direct a new certificate or certificates
to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by

or his legal representative. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate
or certificates, the Board of Directors, the Secretary or the Treasurer, as
the case may be, may, in its or his discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the
same in such manner as the Board of Directors, the Secretary or the Treasurer,
as the case may be, shall require and/or to furnish the Corporation a bond in
such form and substance and with such surety as the Board of Directors, the
Secretary or the Treasurer, as the case may be, may direct as indemnity
against any claim, or expense resulting from any claim, that may be made
against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have

capital stock of the Corporation shall be transferable only on the books of
the Corporation either (a) if such shares are certificated, by the surrender
to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the old stock certificate
therefore duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession,
assignment or authority to transfer, or (b) if such shares are uncertificated,
upon proper instructions from the holder thereof, in each case with such
proof of authenticity of signature as the Corporation or its transfer agent
may reasonably require. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer
of a security (whether certificated or uncertificated), the Corporation shall
treat the registered owner of such security as the person exclusively
entitled to vote, receive notifications and dividends, and otherwise to
exercise all rights and powers of such security.

f. Registered Stockholders. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the
holder of record of any share of stock of the Corporation as the holder in
fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable
or other claim or interest in such share on the part of any other person,
whether or not the Corporation shall have express or other notice thereof,
except as expressly provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.

g. Regulations. The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to
make all such rules and regulations as they may deem expedient concerning the
issue, transfer and registration or the replacement of certificates for shares
of stock of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may (i) appoint
and remove transfer agents and registrars of transfers and (ii) require all
stock certificates to bear the signature of any such transfer agent and/or any
such registrar of transfers.



 

110 h. Stock Options, Warrants, etc. Unless otherwise expressly prohibited in the
resolutions of the Board of Directors creating any class or series of
preferred stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall have the
power and authority to create and issue (whether or not in connection with the

rights or options entitling the holders thereof to purchase from the
Corporation any shares of capital stock of the Corporation of any class or
series or any other securities of the Corporation for such consideration and
to such persons, firms or corporations as the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion, may determine, setting aside from the authorized but unissued
stock of the Corporation the requisite number of shares for issuance upon
the exercise of such warrants, rights or options. Such warrants, rights and
options shall be evidenced by one or more instruments approved by the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors shall be empowered to set the exercise
price, duration, time for exercise and other terms of such warrants, rights
and options; _provided, however_ , that the consideration to be received for
any shares of capital stock subject thereto shall not be less than the par
value thereof.

i. Authority upon Liquidation or Dissolution. Subject to applicable law and
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, any vote or votes
authorizing liquidation of the Corporation or proceeding for its dissolution
may provide, subject to (i) any agreements among and between Stockholders,
(ii) the rights of creditors and (iii) rights expressly provided
for particular classes or series of stock, for the distribution pro rata
among the Stockholders of assets of the Corporation, wholly or in part in
kind, whether such assets be in cash or other property, and may authorize the
Board of Directors of the Corporation to determine the value of the different
assets of the Corporation for the purpose of such liquidation and may divide,
or authorize the Board of Directors of the Corporation to divide, such assets
or any part thereof among the Stockholders in such manner that every
Stockholder will receive a proportionate amount in value (determined as
aforesaid) of cash or property of the Corporation upon such liquidation or
dissolution even though each Stockholder may not receive a strictly
proportionate part of each such asset.

Indemnification

a. Third Party Actions. The Corporation (i) shall, to the maximum extent
permitted from time to time under the laws of the State of Delaware, indemnify
any person who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation
and who is made a party or is or was threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect
subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any of
its direct or indirect subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, and (ii) may, to the maximum extent permitted from time
to time under the laws of the State of Delaware, indemnify every person who is
or was a party or is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was an
employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect
subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any of
its direct or indirect subsidiaries as an employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against expenses (including counsel fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid or owed in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred
by such person or rendered or levied against such person in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent shall not,
in itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and
in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, that the person had reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.



 

111 b. Actions By or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation (i) shall,
to the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the laws of the State
of Delaware, indemnify any person who is a present or former director or
officer of the Corporation and who is made a party or who is or was threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by
or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect
subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
and (ii) may, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the laws
of the State of Delaware, indemnify every person who is or was a party or who
is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure
a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an
employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect
subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any of
its direct or indirect subsidiaries as an employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, against expenses (including counsel fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such
action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation; _provided, however_ , that no indemnification shall be made with
respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of
the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification.

c. Determination. Any indemnification under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or
former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances
because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Sections 8.1 and 8.2, as applicable. Such determination shall be made, with
respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such
determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to
such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by
a committee if designated by majority vote of such directors, even though
less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or
(iv) by the Stockholders.

d. Expenses. Expenses incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation or
any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries in defending a civil or criminal
action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII. Such expenses incurred
by other employees and agents of the Corporation and other persons eligible
for indemnification under this Article VIII may be paid upon such terms and
conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

e. Non-exclusivity. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any provision of law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other governing
documents of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, under any
agreement, vote of Stockholders or disinterested directors or under any policy
or policies of insurance maintained by the Corporation on behalf of any person
or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action
in another capacity while holding any of the positions or having any of the
relationships referred to in this Article VIII.

f. Enforceability. The provisions of this Article VIII (i) are for the
benefit of, and may be enforced directly by, each director or officer of the
Corporation the same as if set forth in their entirety in a written instrument
executed and delivered by the Corporation and such director or officer and
(ii) constitute a continuing offer to all present and future directors and
officers of the Corporation. The Corporation, by its adoption of these
Bylaws, 



 

112  (A) acknowledges and agrees that each present and future director and
officer of the Corporation has relied upon and will continue to rely upon the
provisions of this Article VIII in becoming, and serving as, a director or
officer of the Corporation or, if requested by the Corporation, a director,
officer or fiduciary or the like of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, (B) waives
reliance upon, and all notices of acceptance of, such provisions by such
directors and officers and (C) acknowledges and agrees that no present or
future director or officer of the Corporation shall be prejudiced in his
