indirectly: (i)&nbsp;offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, lend, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any United Shares, (ii)&nbsp;establish or increase any
&#147;put equivalent position&#148; or liquidate or decrease any &#147;call equivalent position&#148; with respect to any United Shares (in each case within the meaning of Section&nbsp;16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) or otherwise enter into any swap, derivative or other transaction or arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any economic consequence of ownership of any United Shares, whether or not
such transaction is to be settled by delivery of United Shares, other securities, cash or other consideration, or (iii)&nbsp;engage directly or indirectly in any transaction, the likely result of which would involve a transaction prohibited by
either of clauses (i)&nbsp;or (ii). The undersigned shall not be prohibited from pledging the undersigned United Shares so long as any pledgee receiving such pledge agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Lock Up Agreement; provided that
the undersigned may not pledge any United Shares, if any, that are held in escrow pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or the Securities Escrow Agreement (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement). The foregoing restriction is
expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to, or reasonably expected to lead to, or result in, a sale or disposition of any United Shares even if such United Shares would be
disposed of by someone other than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with
respect to any of the United Shares or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from the United Shares. The undersigned agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with
United&#146;s transfer agent and registrar against, and authorizes United to cause the transfer agent and registrar to decline, the transfer of relevant securities held by the undersigned except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions. The
restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to transactions relating to United Shares or other securities acquired in open market transactions after completion of the Merger. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <P
