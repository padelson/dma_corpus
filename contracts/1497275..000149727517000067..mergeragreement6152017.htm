ARTICLE III 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF SHARES

SECTION 3.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Seller Bank, Parent, State
Bank, Merger Sub or the shareholders of any of the foregoing:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of common stock, no par value, of the Seller Bank, in its capacity as the
surviving bank in the Merger.

(b) Subject to Section 3.02, Section 3.03 and Section 3.04, each share of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Excluded Shares and Seller Bank Restricted Stock (which shall
be treated as provided in Section 3.04)) shall be canceled, extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount of cash (without
interest) equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration (the "Common Stock
Settlement Payments"). All amounts payable to Shareholders pursuant to this
Section 3.01(b) shall be subject to and reduced by any applicable Tax
withholding amounts as provided in Section 3.09.

(c) Each share of Common Stock held by (i) the Seller Bank in the Seller
Bank's treasury or (ii) the Seller Bank or Parent (in each case, other than
shares of Common Stock held in any Benefit Plans or related trust accounts,
managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary
or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted)
(collectively, the "Excluded Shares") shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

SECTION 3.02 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (the "Dissenting Shares") of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the applicable provisions
of the Code of Alabama shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(b), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code of Alabama. At the
Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Code of Alabama. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the applicable provisions of the
Code of Alabama or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided thereby, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares under such
provisions shall cease and each such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(b). The
Seller Bank shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal
of any shares of Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Seller Bank shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 3.03 Seller Bank Options. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding
Seller Bank Option shall be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the
product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Seller Bank Option and (b) the excess, if any, of the amount
of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price required to be
paid by such holder in order to acquire one share of Common Stock pursuant to
such Seller Bank Option (the "Option Settlement Payments") by entering into a
Stock Option Cash-Out Agreement in the form of Exhibit D. The Surviving Bank
shall distribute all Option Settlement Payments owing to a holder of Seller
Bank Options pursuant to the Seller Bank Holder Payment Schedule, without
interest, at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but not later
than fifteen calendar days after the Effective Time) through its payroll
system in accordance with the Seller Bank Holder Payment Schedule (as defined
below) by check, direct deposit or wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

outstanding share of Seller Bank Restricted Stock shall be canceled,
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount
of cash (without interest) equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration (the

Cash-Out Agreement in the form of Exhibit E. The Surviving Bank shall
distribute all Restricted Stock Settlement Payments owing to a holder of
Seller Bank Restricted Stock pursuant to the Seller Bank Holder Payment
Schedule, without interest, at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time

allocating any payments to the Seller Bank Holders hereunder. Exhibit B sets
forth a form of the Seller Bank Holder Payment Schedule.

(a) the Seller Bank shall cause to be delivered to Parent and State Bank the
officer's certificate contemplated by Section 7.02(c);

(b) Parent, State Bank and Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the
Seller Bank the officer's certificate contemplated by Section 7.03(c); and

holder of record of certificates which evidences the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (excluding, for purposes of this Section 3.07, Seller Bank

form attached hereto as Exhibit C ("Letter of Transmittal"). Parent or State
Bank shall distribute the Common Stock Settlement Payments, without interest,
in accordance with the Seller Bank Holder Payment Schedule, to each
Shareholder who has delivered or delivers a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal and surrenders such holder's Stock Certificate(s) (and such
certificates shall thereafter be marked as canceled) or (subject to Section

(b) If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or
destroyed, then, upon receipt by the Seller Bank or the Surviving Bank of (i)
an executed affidavit in the form attached to the Letter of Transmittal ("Lost

this Section 3.07.

SECTION 3.08 Payments to Persons Other than Registered Holders. If any
consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall
be a condition to such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall

accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
shall pay to the Surviving Bank any transfer or other Taxes payable by the
Surviving Bank required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Stock Certificate so
surrendered, or such Person shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Bank that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

SECTION 3.09 Withholding Tax. Each of State Bank, Surviving Bank and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from any consideration payable
pursuant to Article III of this Agreement only such amounts required to be
deducted or withheld with respect to such payment under applicable Tax Law;
provided that, if the Seller Bank delivers to Parent a fully executed FIRPTA
Certificate no more than thirty days before the Closing Date, none of State
Bank, the Surviving Bank or Parent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold any
amounts from such consideration, except as provided for in Section 3.03 and

SECTION 3.10 No Liability for Abandoned Property. Any other provision of this
Agreement notwithstanding, neither Parent nor the Surviving Bank shall be
liable to any Seller Bank Holder for any amounts paid or property delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

SECTION 3.11 Return of Funds. If and to the extent any Shareholder fails to
deliver a Letter of Transmittal and the related Stock Certificate or Lost
Certificate Affidavit to the Seller Bank prior to one Business Day prior to
the Closing Date, any Per Share Merger Consideration in respect such Stock
Certificate or Lost Certificate Affidavit shall be held by the Surviving Bank
in a separately identifiable bank account (the "Unclaimed Account") separate
and apart from the Surviving Bank's general funds (and shall not be available
for any purpose other than payments to Shareholders who surrender Stock
Certificates or Lost Certificate Affidavits after the Effective Time). On the
one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, any Per Share Merger Consideration
remaining in the Unclaimed Account shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Bank (and any such cash
may be comingled with the general funds of the Surviving Bank), free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto (other
than the claims of the applicable Shareholder and its heirs, assigns and
transferees hereunder), and such Shareholder shall look only to the Surviving
Bank for payment of such amounts. Each Shareholder who delivers a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and surrenders the related Stock
Certificate or Lost Certificate Affidavit shall look only to the Surviving
Bank for satisfaction of any claims related to the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Any interest, dividends or other income earned on the
investment of cash held by the Surviving Bank, together with all Tax and other
liabilities associated therewith, shall be for the account of the Surviving
Bank.

statutory books of the Seller Bank shall be closed as to holders of Common
Stock or Seller Bank Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
and no transfer of Common Stock or Seller Bank Restricted Stock by any such
holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange
in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.07, each Stock Certificate
theretofore representing a share of Common Stock (other than any Excluded
Share) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Aggregate Merger
Consideration payable in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Common Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares), Seller Bank Restricted
Stock and Seller Bank Options.

violation of any provision of this Agreement;

Seller Bank's Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (ii) prior to the
Effective Time, the Seller Bank and the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries shall

notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no

SECTION 6.02 Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Filings.

(a) Each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated hereby and to cooperate with the
other Parties in connection with the foregoing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to: (i) obtain all consents, approvals, waivers, permits and other
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the FDIC, Georgia Department of Banking and
Finance, the Superintendent and the Federal Reserve (collectively, the
"Requisite Regulatory Approvals") as expeditiously as possible, (ii) lift or
rescind as promptly as practicable any Order adversely affecting the ability
of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
effect all necessary registrations and filings, if any, and (iv) fulfill all
of the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement set forth in Article VII.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and
State Bank agree, and shall cause their Subsidiaries, to use their reasonable
best efforts to take any and all actions to the extent necessary to (i) obtain
any Requisite Regulatory Approvals and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every
material impediment to obtaining any Requisite Regulatory Approvals, in each
case, in order to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
occur as promptly as practicable following the date hereof and in any event
prior to the Termination Date.

(c) The Parties agree that they shall cooperate in preparing, submitting,
filing, updating and publishing (as applicable), as expeditiously as possible,
all applications, notifications and report forms as may be required by
applicable Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including those of any applicable Governmental Authority, and the
Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals and
accomplish such actions as expeditiously as possible, it being understood and
agreed that, within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, each Party will
file any application, notice or report required to be filed by such Party with
any Governmental Authority with respect to any Requisite Regulatory Approval
or otherwise required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
and will make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary in
connection therewith.

(d) Each Party shall, subject to applicable Law, (i) permit counsel for the
other Party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Party in connection with, any proposed material written communication to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) provide counsel for the other Party with copies of all filings
made by such Party, and all material correspondence between such Party (and
its advisors) with any Governmental Authority and any other information
supplied by such party and such Party's Affiliates to any Governmental
Authority or received from such Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that materials may be
redacted (1) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Seller Bank
(or any aspect thereof), (2) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (3) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns. Each Party agrees that it will use reasonable best
efforts to keep the other Party fully informed with respect to all
applications and developments related thereto, and, where reasonably
practicable under the circumstances, give the other Party reasonable advance
notice of, and whenever appropriate, invite the other Party and its counsel
(and give due consideration in good faith to any reasonable request of the
other Party) to participate in, any meetings or discussions held with any
Governmental Authority concerning the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that such participation is not objected to by such Governmental
Authority. The Parties further covenant and agree not to extend any waiting
period associated with any Requisite Regulatory Approval or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this
Section 6.02(d) shall not apply with respect to Taxes or matters relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns.

(e) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), acquire, purchase,
lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license) any
business, corporation, partnership, association or other business organization
or division or part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, if
doing so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental
Authority entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) otherwise
impair or delay the ability of Parent or State Bank to perform its material
obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 6.03 Shareholder Approval. Immediately (and in any event within one
Business Day) following the execution of this Agreement, the Seller Bank shall
deliver to Parent a copy of the executed actions by unanimous written consent
of the Seller Bank's shareholders (the "Shareholder Written Consents") which,
individually or in the aggregate, evidence the Shareholder Approval and
include a waiver of any dissenters' rights available to the Shareholders under
the Code of Alabama.

SECTION 6.04 Preservation of Records. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Bank and their respective Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep the
records held by them relating to the respective businesses of the Seller Bank
and the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries for a period consistent with Parent's past
practices (or longer if required by applicable Law) and shall make such
applicable records (or copies) and officers, management, employees, advisors
and representatives available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance
notice, to the Significant Shareholders and any of their respective Affiliates
or representatives as may be reasonably required by such Person solely to the
extent relating to and solely for use in connection with any insurance claims
by, Actions or Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, compliance
with legal requirements by, or the preparation of financial statements of, any
Significant Shareholder or any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise in
connection with any other matter relating to or resulting from this Agreement;
provided that, from and after the Closing Date, if any such Person so requests
such records (or copies), such Person shall, as a condition to receiving such
records (or copies), be required to enter into a customary confidentiality
agreement to keep all such information confidential and not otherwise use or
disclose any such records for any other reason or to any other Person (except
where such disclosure, upon the advice of outside counsel, is required by
applicable Law and only to the extent required by such Law); provided, further
that Parent shall have the right to redact and/or withhold certain records in
order to preserve a claim of privilege or comply with contractual obligations
and shall be entitled to reimbursement of reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred in order to provide such records from such Person making
the request.

SECTION 6.05 Access to Information.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and subject to applicable Law and Section 6.06,
Parent and State Bank shall be entitled, through its representatives
(including its legal advisors, consultants and accountants), to have such
access to the properties, businesses and operations of the Seller Bank and its
Subsidiaries and such examination of the books and records of the Seller Bank
and its Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests in connection with Parent's
efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
such access and examination shall be conducted on reasonable advance written
notice, during regular business hours and under reasonable circumstances and
shall be subject to restrictions under applicable Law. The Seller Bank shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the officers, employees,
consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and other representatives of the
Seller Bank and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with Parent and
Parent's representatives in connection with such access and examination, and
Parent and its representatives shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller Bank
and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, consultants,
agents, accountants, attorneys and other representatives and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the business of
the Seller Bank. Prior to the Closing, Parent and Parent's representatives may
contact and communicate with employees of the Seller Bank and its Subsidiaries
to the extent necessary in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
Seller Bank; provided that such requested communication does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Seller Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such access
or examination shall be permitted to the extent that it would (i) unreasonably
disrupt the operations of the Seller Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
would reasonably be expected to cause the Seller Bank or any of the Seller
Bank's Subsidiaries to waive an attorney-client, other legal privilege or the
work product doctrine, or violate any Contract or obligation of
confidentiality or non-disclosure or conflict with any confidentiality
obligations to which the Seller Bank or any of the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries
is bound, in each case with respect to information to be disclosed; provided,
however, that the Seller Bank shall request, but shall not be required to
obtain, a waiver of any such confidentiality obligations upon Parent's
reasonable prior written request; and provided, further, that the Seller Bank
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek alternative means to
disclose such information as nearly as possible without waiving any attorney-
client privilege, other legal privilege or the work product doctrine, or
violating or conflicting with such Contract or other obligation of
confidentiality or non-disclosure (it being understood that such commercially
reasonable efforts shall not require the Seller Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay any consideration or amend or modify any Contract).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Closing, (A) without the prior written consent of the Seller Bank, neither
Parent nor State Bank shall, and Parent and State Bank shall cause their
respective officers, employees, legal advisors, consultants, agents,
accountants and other representatives not to, contact any supplier, customer,
client, independent contractor, landlord, lessor, any person with whom the
Seller Bank or any of the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries have or have had a
business relationship or other representative of or to the Seller Bank or any
of the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries with respect to the Seller Bank, any of the
Seller Bank's Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (B) neither Parent nor State Bank shall have any right to perform invasive
or subsurface investigations of the properties or facilities of the Seller
Bank or any of the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of the Seller Bank. The Seller Bank does not make any representation
or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any) provided or
obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 and neither Parent nor State Bank may
rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as
expressly set forth in the Seller Bank's representations and warranties
contained in Article IV. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.05 or
otherwise by Parent, State Bank or their representatives shall be deemed to
modify any of the Seller Bank's representations and warranties contained in
Article IV.

(b) Each of Parent and State Bank acknowledges that the information provided
to Parent and State Bank in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference.

SECTION 6.06 Public Statements; Confidentiality.

(a) None of the Seller Bank, on the one hand, or Parent or State Bank, on the
other hand, shall issue any press release or make any public announcement or
comment concerning this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal and the
Shareholder Written Consents or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby without obtaining the prior written approval of Parent or the Seller
Bank, as applicable (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless and only to the extent, (i) disclosure by a
Party is required to enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement or
(ii) in the judgment of such Party upon the advice of its outside counsel,
disclosure is required by applicable Law (including the periodic reporting
requirements under the Exchange Act) or under the rules of any securities
exchange on which the securities of such Party or any of its Affiliates are
listed; provided that to the extent so required by applicable Law, the Party
intending to issue such press release or make such public announcement or
comment shall use its reasonable best efforts consistent with applicable Law
to consult with the other Parties in advance of such press release, public
announcement or comment with respect to the text or content thereof.

(b) Each of the Parties shall keep this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal
and the Shareholder Written Consents and the terms and conditions set forth
herein and therein strictly confidential and shall not disclose or otherwise
make any of the foregoing available to any other Person and shall not publicly
file copies of this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal and the Shareholder
Written Consents, except (i) where such disclosure, availability or filing,
upon the advice of outside counsel, is required by applicable Law (including
the periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act) and only to the
extent required by such Law or under the rules of any securities exchange on
which the securities of such Party or any of its Affiliates are listed, (ii)
disclosure by any Significant Shareholder or their respective Affiliates of
customary information to investors or potential investors of such Significant
Shareholder or to investors or potential investors of any Affiliate of such
Significant Shareholder who are subject to customary confidentiality
obligations, (iii) disclosure by a Party is required to enforce its rights and
remedies under this Agreement, (iv) disclosure by a Party if such disclosure
is required to comply with such Party's obligations under Section 6.02, (v)
disclosure as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with any Tax
matter and (vi) as otherwise agreed by each of the Parties. In the event that
any such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law
(other than any filing required by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act),
each Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
"confidential treatment" or similar treatment of this Agreement, the Letters
of Transmittal and the Shareholder Written Consents and to redact such terms
of this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal and the Shareholder Written
Consents that the other Parties shall reasonably request.

SECTION 6.07 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Bank and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on
or prior to the Closing Date were directors or officers of the Seller Bank or
any of the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries (collectively, the "DandO Indemnitees")
with respect to all acts or omissions (or alleged acts or omissions) by the
DandO Indemnitees, or any of them, in their capacities as such or taken at the
request of the Seller Bank or any of the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries at any
time on or prior to the Closing Date to the same extent as such Persons would
be indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the
Organizational Documents of Seller Bank or any of its Subsidiaries in effect
as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) Any DandO Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of
this Section 6.07 upon learning of any such Liability or litigation, shall
promptly notify Parent thereof; provided, that failure to provide such notice
shall not relieve Parent of its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.07
unless and only to the extent such failure materially prejudices Parent. In
the event of any such litigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Parent or Surviving Bank shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof and neither Parent nor Surviving Bank shall be liable to
such DandO Indemnitee for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such DandO Indemnitee in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the DandO Indemnitee advises that there are substantive issues which
raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the DandO Indemnitee, the DandO
Indemnitee may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO Indemnitee promptly
as statements therefor are received; provided, that Parent shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all DandO
Indemnitees in any jurisdiction, (ii) the DandO Indemnitees will reasonably
cooperate in the defense of any such litigation; and (iii) Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent and which
does not provide for a complete and irrevocable release of all Parent,
Surviving Bank and its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers
and controlling persons, employees, agents and Representatives; and provided
further, that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines, and such
determination becomes final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of
such DandO Indemnitee in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law, then the indemnification obligations hereunder of Parent,
State Bank and their respective Subsidiaries shall apply only to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, as so finally determined by such court of
competent jurisdiction.

(c) The Surviving Bank shall provide or maintain in effect for six years from
and after the Effective Time, through the purchase of "run-off" coverage or
otherwise, directors' and officers' and corporate liability insurance covering
those individuals who are covered by the directors' and officers' and
corporate liability insurance policy or policies provided for directors and
officers of the Seller Bank and the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed by
such director or officer by reason of serving in such capacity (the "Existing
Policy") from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Seller Bank's current insurance carrier and on terms no less favorable in
all respects to the Existing Policy and such coverage shall contain minimum
aggregate limits of liability for directors' and officers' and corporate
liability insurance coverage for directors and officers of the Seller Bank and
its Subsidiaries with the amount of coverage at least equal to that of the
Existing Policies and deductibles no larger than those of the Existing Policy;
provided, however, that if such "run-off" or other coverage is not available
at a cost less than or equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof under the Existing Policy (the "Insurance
Cap") (which premiums are set forth in Section 6.07(c) of the Seller Bank
Disclosure Schedule), then the Surviving Bank shall be required to obtain as
much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such
annual premiums as do not exceed the Insurance Cap.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Bank under this Section 6.07
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any DandO Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.07 applies without the consent of
each affected DandO Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the DandO
Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.07 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.07). The provisions of this Section 6.07 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnitee, his, her or its heirs and his, her or its representatives and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Law, Contract
or otherwise.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Bank or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates or merges with or into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made by
Parent and the Surviving Bank so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Bank shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this
Section 6.07.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Seller Bank or any of the Seller Bank's Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.07 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

SECTION 6.08 Employee Benefits and Contracts.

(a) All persons who are employees of the Seller Bank immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including employees on approved leaves of absence, and whose
employment is not terminated, if any, at or prior to the Effective Time (a
"Continuing Employee") shall, at the Effective Time, become employees of the
Surviving Bank; provided, however, that in no event shall any of the employees
of the Seller Bank be officers of Parent or the Surviving Bank, or have or
exercise any power or duty conferred upon such an officer, unless and until
duly elected or appointed to such position in accordance with the Bylaws and
the policies and procedures of Parent or Surviving Bank. Parent and Surviving
Bank, as applicable, shall provide Continuing Employees with compensation
generally consistent with similarly situated employees of Surviving Bank in
similar market areas. All of the Continuing Employees shall be employed at the
will of the Surviving Bank, and no contractual right to employment shall inure
to such employees because of this Agreement except as may be otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement.

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall make available employer-provided
benefits under the Parent Plans to each Continuing Employee on the same basis
as it provides such coverage to similarly situated Parent or State Bank
employees. With respect to Parent Plans providing health or welfare coverage,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing
condition, eligibility waiting period, or other limitations or exclusions
otherwise applicable under such plans to new employees not to apply to a
Continuing Employee or their covered dependents who were covered under a
similar Plan at the Effective Time of the Merger. If any such transition
occurs during the middle of a plan year, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such successor Parent Plan providing health or
welfare coverage to give credit towards satisfaction of any annual deductible
limitation and out-of-pocket maximum applied under such successor plan for any
deductible, co-payment and other cost-sharing amounts previously paid by a
Continuing Employee respecting his or her participation in the corresponding
Plan during that plan year prior to the transition effective date. Each
Continuing Employee shall be entitled to full credit under any Parent Plan for
prior service with the Seller Bank solely for purposes of eligibility and
vesting.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 6.08 with respect to employees of the Seller Bank and the Subsidiaries
are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall
not create any right (i) in any other Person, including, without limitation,
any employee, former employee or any participant or any beneficiary thereof in
any Plan or Parent Plan, or (ii) to continued employment with the Seller Bank,
any of the Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Bank. After the Effective
Time, nothing contained in this Section 6.08 is intended to be or shall be
considered to be an amendment or adoption of any plan, program, agreement,
arrangement or policy of the Seller Bank, any of the Subsidiaries, Parent or
the Surviving Bank nor shall it interfere with Parent's, the Surviving Bank or
any of the Subsidiaries' right to amend, modify or terminate any Plan or to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Seller Bank or the
Subsidiaries for any reason.

(d) Upon not less than fifteen (15) days' notice prior to the Closing Date
from Parent to the Seller Bank, the Seller Bank shall cause the termination,
amendment or other appropriate modification of each Plan as specified by
Parent in such notice such that neither the Seller Bank or its Subsidiaries
shall sponsor or otherwise have any further Liability thereunder in
connection with such applicable Plans, except with respect to Liabilities
incurred prior to such time or in connection with such termination, amendment
or modification and subject to the terms of such Plan, effective as of the
date which immediately precedes the Closing Date.

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.08(d), (i) prior to the Closing, the appropriate
board of directors among the Seller Bank and its Subsidiaries shall adopt
resolutions terminating each Plan which provides for a "cash or deferred
arrangement" pursuant to Code Section 401(k) (each, a "401(k) Plan"),
effective as of the date which immediately precedes the date which includes
the Effective Time (the "Termination Date"), (ii) prior to each 401(k) Plan's
termination under "(i)," immediately above, the Seller Bank shall cause each
401(k) Plan to adopt all amendments, including amendments and restatements, of
each document evidencing each 401(k) Plan, as may be required by applicable
law, and (iii) as of the Termination Date, the Seller Bank shall cause each
401(k) Plan to proceed with implementing the process of distributing each

Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this entire Agreement shall forthwith

SECTION 9.02 Amendment/Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or
changed only by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties. Each
provision in this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument making
specific reference to this Agreement signed by the Party against whom
enforcement of any such provision so waived is sought. No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action
of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on
the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

SECTION 9.03 Assignment. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law
or otherwise), by (a) the Seller Bank, without the prior written consent of
Parent or (b) any of Parent or State Bank without the prior written consent of
the Seller Bank. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Any attempted assignment without
obtaining such required consent shall be null and void.

SECTION 9.04 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Seller Bank Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and the Exhibits and the Schedules hereto), the Letters of Transmittal and the
Shareholder Written Consents represent the entire understanding and agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

SECTION 9.05 Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any Party under
this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an
Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by such Party.

SECTION 9.06 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in Section 6.04, Section 6.07, this Section
9.06, and Section 9.13, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Bank Holders are third party
beneficiaries of Section 9.13 and of each covenant or agreement in this
Agreement to be performed by Parent or the Surviving Bank following the
Closing.

SECTION 9.07 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement (including Section 6.09 (Transfer Taxes)), whether or not the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all direct and
indirect costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring such
expenses and, which in the case of the Seller Bank, shall be paid at Closing.

SECTION 9.08 Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Georgia, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
federal or state court located in Atlanta, Georgia ("Georgia Courts"), and any
appellate court from any decision thereof, in any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, including the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of any
such Action shall be heard and determined in the Georgia Courts, (ii) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement in the Georgia Courts, including any objection
based on its place of incorporation, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Action in any such court and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any
such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the
Parties consents and agrees that service of process, summons, notice or
document for any action permitted hereunder may be delivered by registered
mail addressed to it at the applicable address set forth in Section 9.01 or in
any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER
NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND
BARGAINED FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY
AND THAT ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A
COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

SECTION 9.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or email in .pdf format), each
of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.

SECTION 9.10 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party (or to the Seller Bank Holders). Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

SECTION 9.11 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any Party and at the expense
of the Party so requesting, each other Party shall execute and deliver to such
requesting Party such documents and take such other action as such requesting
Party may reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

SECTION 9.12 Remedies.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise by
a party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
such remedy.

(b) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the rights of each Party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate
remedy at Law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that prior to a valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, subject to
and without limiting Section 9.12(c) below (if applicable), such non-breaching
Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to enforce its rights and each
Party's respective obligations hereunder by an Action or Actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond
or other security). Each of the Parties agrees that it shall not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and hereby
waives (i) any defenses in any Action for an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief, including the defense that the other Parties have
an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity, and (ii) any requirement
under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

(c) To the extent any Party brings any Action before any Governmental
Authority to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action
is pending, plus twenty Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action.

(d) None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other
than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive in accordance with its
terms) shall survive the Effective Time, except for Section 6.07 and for those
other covenants and agreements contained herein and therein which by their
terms apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

SECTION 9.13 Waiver of Conflicts. It is acknowledged by each of the Parties
that each of the Seller Bank and certain Affiliates of the Significant
Shareholders have retained Skadden to act as its counsel in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and that Skadden has not acted as counsel
for any other Party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and that none of the other Parties has the status of a client of Skadden for
conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Each Party
hereby agrees that, in the event that any dispute arises after the Closing
between Parent, the Surviving Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the Significant Shareholders or their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Skadden may represent any or all of
the Significant Shareholders in such dispute even though the interests of the
Significant Shareholders may be directly adverse to Parent, the Surviving Bank
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and even though Skadden
formerly may have represented the Seller Bank or any of the Seller Bank's
Subsidiaries in any matter substantially related to such dispute. Each of the
Seller Bank (on behalf of itself and the Surviving Bank), Parent and State
Bank acknowledges and agrees that, in connection with any future dispute
between Parent, the Surviving Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the Significant Shareholders or their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as to all communications among Skadden, the Seller Bank, any of the
Seller Bank's Subsidiaries, any Significant Shareholder that relate in any way
to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to each Significant Shareholder and
may be controlled by such Person and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Parent, the Surviving Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates. The Parties understand and agree that the Parties have each
undertaken commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of
confidential or attorney-client privileged information. Notwithstanding those
efforts, the Parties further understand and agree that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may result in the inadvertent
disclosure of information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of
privilege. The Parties further understand and agree that any disclosure of
information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will
not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege.
Accordingly, each of Parent and the Surviving Bank agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed information
to the appropriate Person upon becoming aware of its existence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent, the Surviving Bank or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one
hand, and a third party (other than a Party, any Significant Shareholder or
their respective Affiliates), on the other hand, after the Closing, the
Surviving Bank may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by Skadden to such third party. Skadden shall
be a third party beneficiary for purposes of this Section 9.13.
