 **ARTICLE III** 

 

  

 

  **PURCHASE PRICE**

 

 

3.1 _Purchase Price_. The consideration for the Purchased Assets shall be
$95,000,000 (the " _Base Cash Consideration_ "), plus the Contingent
Consideration Payment, if any, plus the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
(together, the " _Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment after the Closing
as provided in Section 3.6 below. The Base Cash Consideration, less the
Escrow Amount (the " _Closing Date Cash Consideration_ "), shall be paid at
the Closing to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such bank account or accounts as shall be specified in written instructions
delivered to Buyer by SBC at least three Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

 

3.1.1 _Contingent Consideration_. Sellers shall be eligible for a further
payment, in addition to the Base Cash Consideration, of $7.5 million (the "
_Contingent Consideration Payment_ "). The Contingent Consideration Payment
will be payable only if the Operating Profit of the Business exceeds the Base
Operating Profit. As promptly as reasonable practicable after September 30,
2006, but in any event before November 30, 2006, Buyer shall deliver to
Sellers a calculation of the Operating Profit showing in reasonable detail
the basis therefor (the " _Operating Profit Statement_ "). Buyer shall
deliver to Sellers any supporting documentation for the Operating
Profit Statement promptly upon request.

 

 

3.1.2 Sellers may dispute the calculation of the Operating Profit, but only
on the basis that the Operating Profit was not arrived at in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Sellers shall
have notified Buyer in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount
thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for
such dispute, within twenty (20) Business Days following delivery
the Operating Profit Statement. In the event of such dispute, Buyer and
Sellers shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by
them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
Buyer and Sellers. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to reach a resolution with
such effect within twenty (20) days after receipt of such written notice of
dispute, Buyer and Sellers shall submit the items remaining in dispute for
resolution to an accounting firm independent of Buyer and Sellers mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Sellers (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
which shall, within thirty (30) days after such submission, determine and
report to Buyer and Sellers upon such remaining disputed items, and such
report shall be final, binding and conclusive. Buyer and Sellers will furnish
or cause to be furnished to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers
and other documents and information reasonably relating to the disputed
issues as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and as are
reasonably available to that party or its agents and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material
relating to the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be
authorized to resolve only those items remaining in dispute between Buyer and
Sellers, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.1.2 within the
range of differences between Buyer's position and Seller's position. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between
Buyer and Sellers in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of all
such remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm
that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted.

 

 

3.1.3 The Operating Profit Statement shall be deemed final for purposes
of Section 3.1.1 upon the earliest of (i) the failure of Sellers to notify
Buyer of a dispute within twenty (20) Business Days following the delivery of
the Operating Profit Statement to Sellers, (ii) ** ** the resolution of all
disputes, pursuant to Section 3.1.2 by Buyer and Sellers, and (iii) the
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 3.1.2, by the Independent
Accounting Firm. Within five (5) Business days of the Contingent
Consideration Payment being deemed final, such payment shall be made in
accordance with written wire instructions provided to Buyer from Sellers.

 

 

3.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seventy-two percent of the
Consideration shall be allocated to the Purchased Assets of SBC and Milso
Inc. and twenty-eight percent of the Consideration shall be allocated to the
Purchased Assets of Milso LLC. Within a reasonable period of time following
Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall agree on the allocation of the Consideration
among the Purchased Assets, which allocation shall be consistent with Section
1060 of the Code and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "
_Tax Allocation_ "). Except as required by Applicable Law, Buyer and Sellers
agree to use the Tax Allocation in filing all required forms under Section
1060 of the Code, and all other Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Tax Allocation shall not be made prior to the Closing on account of the
Contingent Consideration unless and until such consideration is payable under
Section 3.1.1, and if such consideration becomes so payable the parties shall
allocate the amount of such consideration solely to goodwill and going
concern value. Buyer and Sellers further agree that the payment of the
Closing Date Cash Consideration and the Contingent Consideration to Sellers
contemplated by Article III may be made to a single Seller that is designated
by SBC in writing as being authorized to act as agent for all Sellers,
whereupon each Seller shall be deemed to have received the Cash Consideration
allocable to the Purchased Assets owned by such Seller in accordance with the
allocation determination under this Section 3.2. In connection with the
determination of the foregoing Tax Allocation, the parties shall cooperate
with each other and provide such information as any of them shall reasonably
request. The parties will each report the federal, state and local and other
Tax consequences of the purchase and sale contemplated hereby (including the
filing of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in a manner consistent with the
Tax Allocation.

 

 

3.3 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer (on the one hand) and Sellers (on the other)
each shall bear 50% of the cost of all Taxes (excluding Taxes based on or
measured by income, which shall be solely the responsibility of the Sellers)
that are or may be imposed by any government or political subdivision thereof
and that are payable or arise as a result of this transfer of the Purchased
Assets, notwithstanding the Party upon which such Taxes are actually imposed.
Buyer and Sellers shall jointly prepare any Tax Returns relating to such
Taxes, and the party or parties responsible for filing each such return will
file that return. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate with each other in
determining the amount of such Taxes payable and in preparing and filing the
applicable Tax Returns. Buyer shall furnish to Sellers properly completed
exemption certificates for any Taxes from which Buyer claims to be exempt.

 

 

3.4 _Proration of Taxes and Certain Charges_. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, all real property Taxes, personal
property Taxes or similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the
Purchased Assets for any taxable period that includes the day before
the Closing Date and ends on or after the Closing Date, whether imposed or
assessed before or after the Closing Date, shall be prorated between Sellers
and Buyer as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date. If any Taxes subject to
proration are paid by Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand,
the proportionate amount of such Taxes paid (or in the event a refund of any
portion of such Taxes previously paid is received, such refund) shall be paid
promptly by (or to) the other after the payment of such Taxes (or promptly
following the receipt of any such refund). Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, all installments of special assessments or other
charges on or with respect to the Purchased Assets payable by Sellers for any
period in which the Closing Date shall occur, including base rent, common
area maintenance, royalties, all municipal, utility or authority charges for
water, sewer, electric or gas charges, garbage or waste removal, and cost of
fuel, shall be apportioned as of the Closing Date and each party shall pay
its proportionate share promptly upon the receipt of any bill, statement or
other charge with respect thereto. If such charges or rates are assessed
either based upon time or for a specified period, such charges or rates shall
be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date. If such charges or rates
are assessed based upon usage of utility or similar services, such charges
shall be prorated based upon meter readings taken on the Closing Date. Except
as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all amounts due or paid
pursuant to the terms of the Assumed Contracts, for any period in which the
Closing Date shall occur shall be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing
Date.

 

 

3.5 _Escrow Agreement_. 

 

 

3.5.1 An amount equal to $10 million (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") shall be
deposited by wire transfer of immediately available funds with the
Escrow Agent, under an escrow agreement to be entered into on the Closing
Date by the Escrow Agent, Sellers and Buyer substantially in the form of
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Fund shall be used
for indemnity purposes as set forth in Article XIV, to ensure the retention
of Key Employees as described herein and for payment of the Closing Working
Capital Adjustment, if any. On the date that is ten (10) days following the
end of the Indemnity Period, any remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund not
subject to pending claims shall be distributed to the Sellers pursuant to the

to each such payment. The Shareholders' Representative and Buyer shall each
instruct the Escrow Agent to, and use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Escrow Agent to, keep confidential all information relating to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that, (a) at the request
of the Shareholders' Representative or Buyer such information may be
disclosed to the Shareholders' Representative and Buyer, (b) such information
may be disclosed as required by Applicable Law and (c) such information may
be disclosed in an action or proceeding brought by the Escrow Agent, a
Seller, Shareholder or Buyer in pursuit of its rights or in exercise of its
remedies under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Each Shareholder
agrees and acknowledges that the Shareholder Representative (as defined in

behalf.

Closing Working Capital to vary by more than $50,000 from the amount which it
would have been after giving effect to the amounts disputed by Sellers;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Sellers shall have notified Buyer in writing
of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within twenty (20)
Business Days following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and Working
Capital Calculation to Sellers. In the event of such dispute, Buyer and
Sellers shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by
them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
Buyer and Sellers. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to reach a resolution with
such effect within twenty (20) days after receipt of such written notice of
dispute, Buyer and Sellers shall submit the items remaining in dispute for
resolution to an accounting firm independent of Buyer and Sellers mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Sellers (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
which shall, within thirty (30) days after such submission, determine and
report to Buyer and Sellers upon such remaining disputed items, and such
report shall be final, binding and conclusive. Buyer and Sellers will furnish
or cause to be furnished to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers
and other documents and information reasonably relating to the disputed
issues as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and as are
reasonably available to that party or its agents and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material
relating to the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be
authorized to resolve only those items remaining in dispute between Buyer and
Sellers, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.6 within the
range of differences between Buyer's position and Sellers' position. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be (i) allocated
between Buyer and Sellers in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of
all such remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of
such remaining disputed items so submitted.

 

 

3.6.3 _Adjustment to Sellers Consideration_. The Closing Balance Sheet and
the Working Capital Calculation shall be deemed final for purposes of this
Section 3.6 upon the earliest of (i) the failure of Sellers to notify Buyer
of a dispute within twenty (20) Business Days following the delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital Calculation to Sellers, (ii)
the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 3.6.2(ii), by Buyer and
Sellers, and (iii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to
Section 3.6.2(ii), by the Independent Accounting Firm. Within five (5)
Business Days of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital
Calculation being deemed final, an adjustment to the Consideration shall be
made as follows:

 

 

(i) If the Closing Working Capital is less than $21,000,000, the difference,
up to $2,500,000, shall be paid by wire transfer from the Escrow Fund to an
account specified by Buyer.

 

 

(ii) If the Closing Working Capital is equal to or greater than $21,000,000,
no adjustment to the Consideration shall be made.

 

 

(iii) Buyer and the Shareholder's Representative shall promptly give a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent specifying the dollar amounts to be
paid from the Escrow Fund as determined under this Section 3.6.3, if any. Any
such payment shall be made without regard to the "Qualifying Claim" and
"deductible" provided for in Section 14.4.1.

obligations do not exceed $100,000 in the aggregate and _provided further_ ,
that Buyer assumes no obligation of Sellers for incidental or consequential

infringement, the sole warranty obligation of Buyer assumed hereunder being
the obligation to repair or replace defective goods;

 

 

4.2.5 All liabilities, obligations and commitments of any nature or
description which arise from or are incurred in connection with the operation
of the Business, or the ownership, use or operation of the Purchased Assets,

and commitments of Seller with respect to the Transferred Employees, each
as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet.

 

 Except for the obligations expressly assumed by Buyer pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, it is understood and agreed that
Buyer does not and will not assume or become obligated to pay or perform with
respect to third parties any debts, liabilities, contracts or other
obligations of Sellers or their Affiliates, or intercompany liabilities among

Environmental Liabilities and Costs accrued prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
any liabilities or obligations of the Sellers or the Business for Taxes
accrued prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

4.3 _Offers of Employment_. The following shall apply with respect to

for Buyer in connection with the operation of Business.

 

 

4.3.2 Buyer shall offer employment on and as of the Closing Date, on an at-
will basis, to the persons named on _Schedule 4.3.2_, other than the Key
Employees, at base wages or salaries which are no less than those presently
in effect as described on _Schedule 4.3.2_. In addition, for a period of
twenty-four months after Closing (other than with respect to group health
coverage, for which such period shall be the 12 months following the
Closing), the welfare, benefit plans, programs and arrangements and salary
and wages provided to any Transferred Employee (as defined below) shall be
substantially similar in the aggregate to the programs and arrangements and
salary and wages applicable to such employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date. In determining any Transferred Employee's eligibility to participate in
and vesting under Buyer's defined contribution retirement plans, employee
welfare and benefit plans, programs and arrangements, and the level
of vacation under Buyer's policies, the Transferred Employees will receive
full credit, to the extent legally permitted, for all service with Seller
prior to the Closing (to the same extent such Transferred Employees received
such credit with respect to such plans, programs and arrangements maintained
by Seller). For a period of twenty-four months after Closing, each
Transferred Employee shall be entitled to not less than three days of sick
pay per year. Buyer will provide group health coverage to the Transferred
Employees and their dependents without imposing any pre-existing condition
exclusions, waiting periods or actively-at-work requirements except to the
extent such requirements were applicable to the Transferred Employee or
dependent under an applicable group health plan of Seller immediately prior
to the Closing Date. Those employees who accept such offers of employment
effective as of the Closing Date shall be referred to herein as the "
_Transferred Employees._ " Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
assume the liability of Sellers in respect of the Transferred Employees for
accrued but unpaid salaries, wages, vacation and sick pay and incentive
compensation, but only to the extent such liability is reflected on the
Balance Sheet or arose after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with the prior practice of Sellers. Buyer shall assume
no such liability or obligations with respect to employees who are not
Transferred Employees and Sellers shall retain, consistent with their normal
employment practices, all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
employees. Sellers shall remain responsible for payment of any and all
employee termination costs, retention, change in control, severance or other
similar compensation or benefits which are or may become payable
in connection with the consummation Contemplated Transaction.

 

 

4.4 _Other Employee Benefits_. Sellers agree that, with respect to claims
for workers' compensation and all claims under Sellers' employee benefit
programs by persons working for the Business arising out of events occurring
prior to the Closing, whether reported or unreported as of the Closing and
whether insured or uninsured (including, but not limited to, workers'
compensation, life insurance, medical and disability programs), Sellers
shall, at their own expense, honor or cause its insurance carriers to honor
such claims in accordance with the terms and conditions of such programs or
applicable workers' compensation statutes. Without limiting the scope of the
preceding sentence, Sellers shall be responsible for any and all claims and
liabilities arising out of or relating to (i) employment by Sellers of the
Employees (other than Transferred Employees as provided in Section 4.3.2),
(ii) the termination by Sellers of the employment of any such Employee and
(iii) the provision of any employee benefits to such Employees (and their
beneficiaries and eligible dependents) attributable to their employment with,
or their participation in any plans or programs maintained or contributed to
by, Sellers or any of their Affiliates, including, but not limited to,
benefits and/or liabilities arising on or before the Closing Date under WARN
and/or COBRA which are or may become payable in connection with the
consummation of the Contemplated Transaction. By way of amplification of
the definition of "Excluded Liabilities," the Sellers shall remain
responsible for the payment of all benefits accrued or claims incurred under
the terms of the Sellers' or their Affiliates' Plans (as defined by Section
6.18 below) with respect to any employee, former employee or director of
Sellers and their Affiliates, including each Transferred Employee. Buyer
shall not at any time assume any liability for the benefits of an active,
inactive or terminated, vested or retired participant in any of the Sellers'
or its Affiliates' Plans.

 

 The terms of Sections 4.3 and 4.4 are an agreement between the Sellers and
the Buyer only. Nothing in Sections 4.3 or 4.4, whether express or implied,
confers upon any employee of Sellers or Buyer, any Transferred Employee or
any other Person any rights or remedies, including, but not limited to, (A)
any right of employment or recall, (B) any right to continued employment for
any specified period, or (C) any right to claim any particular
compensation, benefit or aggregate of the benefits, of any kind or nature
whatsoever, as a result of Sections 4.3 and 4.4.

 

 

4.5 _Employment Taxes_.

 

 

4.5.1 For tax purposes only, Sellers and Buyer will (i) treat Buyer as a
"successor employer" and Sellers as a "predecessor," within the meaning
of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b) (1) of the Code, with respect
to Transferred Employees who are employed by Buyer for purposes of Taxes
imposed under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act (" _FICA_ ") or
the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act (" _FUTA_ ") and (ii)
cooperate with each other to avoid, to the extent possible, the filing of
more than one IRS Form W-2 with respect to each such Transferred Employee for
the calendar year within which the Closing Date occurs.

 

 

4.5.2 At the request of Buyer with respect to any particular applicable Tax
law relating to employment, unemployment insurance, social security,
disability, workers' compensation, payroll, health care or other similar Tax
other than Taxes imposed under FICA and FUTA, Sellers and Buyer will (i)
treat Buyer as a successor employer and Sellers as a predecessor employer,
within the meaning of the relevant provisions of such Tax law, with respect
to Transferred Employees who are employed by Buyer and (ii) cooperate with
each other to avoid, to the extent possible, the filing of more than one
individual information reporting form pursuant to each such Tax law with
respect to each such Transferred Employee for the calendar year within which
the Closing Date occurs.

is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing under
the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or
operated by it requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Agreement and the other documents and instruments to be executed and

hereunder and thereunder.

 

 

6.2 _Authorization of Agreement and Enforceability_. The execution and

the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of formation, operating
agreement or other equivalent organizational document of any Seller, (ii)

require any consent, authorization or approval of, or exemption by, or filing

of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) upon the Purchased
Assets, which violation, conflict, breach, default, acceleration or
Encumbrance, or the failure to make or obtain such filing, consent,
authorization or approval, with respect to the matters specified in clauses
(ii) through (v) could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

complete copies of (i) the combining balance sheets of SBC and Milso LLC at

Assets constitute all such rights necessary to conduct the Business in
accordance with past practice and are being conveyed to Buyer together with
the other Purchased Assets. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, the validity of
the Proprietary Rights and the rights therein of Sellers have not been
questioned in any litigation to which either Seller is a party, nor has any

of the Business does not materially conflict with patent rights, licenses,

property rights of others.

Proprietary Rights owned or licensed by Seller. No present or former

coverage or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefore and (ii)
the amount of any tax benefit available to the Seller as a result, directly
or indirectly of the damages. Seller Indemnitees shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance
coverage and from such other party alleged to have responsibility. If a
Seller Indemnitee receives an amount under insurance coverage or from such
other party with respect to Seller Damages at any time subsequent to any
indemnification provided by Buyer pursuant to Article XIV, then such Seller
Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse Buyer for any payment made or expense
incurred by Buyer in connection with providing such indemnification up to
such amount received by the Seller Indemnitee, but net of any expenses
incurred by such Seller Indemnitee in collecting such amount.

 

 Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees only for those
claims giving rise to Seller Damages and to which the Seller Indemnitees have
given Buyer written notice thereof prior to the end of the Indemnity Period.
Any written notice delivered by a Seller Indemnitee to Buyer with respect to
Seller Damages shall set forth with as much specificity as is reasonably
practicable the basis of the claim for Seller Damages and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof.

 

 

14.7 _Third Party Indemnification_. The obligations of any Indemnifying
Party to indemnify any Indemnified Party under this Article XIV with respect
to Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be, resulting from the
assertion of liability by third parties (a " _Claim_ "), will be subject to
the following terms and conditions:

 

 

14.7.1 Any party against whom any Claim is asserted (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") will give the party required to provide indemnity
hereunder the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of any such Claim
promptly after learning of such Claim, and the Indemnifying Party may at its
option undertake the defense thereof by representatives of its own choosing.
Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the
Indemnifying Party's obligations under this Section, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give
prompt notice. If the Indemnifying Party, within thirty days after notice of
any such Claim, fails to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified
Party against whom such claim has been made will (upon further notice to the
Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at
the expense, of the Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior
to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof.

 

 

14.7.2 Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the
Indemnified Party shall not settle a claim for which it is indemnified
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not
enter into any settlement or compromise of any action, suit or proceeding or
consent to the entry of any judgment for other than monetary damages to be
borne by the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 

14.7.3 If the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense of any such
claim by a third party, or litigation resulting therefrom, after receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may defend against
such claim or litigation in such manner as it deems appropriate.

 

 

14.7.4 If the Indemnifying Party shall not, within thirty (30) days after
its receipt of the notice required by Section 14.7 hereof, advise the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party denies the right of the
Indemnified Party to indemnity in respect of the claim, then the amount of
such claim shall be deemed to be finally determined between the Parties
hereto. If the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party that it
disputes any claim made by the Indemnified Party, then the Parties hereto
shall endeavor to settle and compromise such claim, and if unable to agree on
any settlement or compromise, such claim for indemnification shall be settled
by appropriate litigation, and any liability established by reason of such
settlement, compromise or litigation shall be deemed to be finally
determined. Any claim that is finally determined in the manner set forth
above shall be paid promptly by the Indemnifying Party.

 

 

14.8 _Payment of Indemnification Obligations_. Each Party with indemnity
obligations under this Article XIV shall pay promptly to any Party being
indemnified the amount of all damages, losses, deficiencies, liabilities,
costs, expenses, claims and other obligations to which the foregoing
provisions of this Article XIV relates.

 

 

14.9 _Interest on Unpaid Obligations_. If all or part of any
indemnification obligation under this Agreement is not paid when due, the
Party with indemnity obligations under this Article XIV shall pay the Party
being indemnified interest on the unpaid amount of such obligation for each
day from the date the amount became due until it is paid in full, payable on
demand, at the rate equal to the lower of (i) the maximum rate permitted by
law or (ii) two percent (2%) per annum plus the "Prime Rate" as published
from time to time in _The Wall Street Journal_.

 

 

14.10 _Cooperation with Proceedings_. The parties hereto agree to
cooperate with each other and to provide each other with all information and
documentation reasonably necessary to permit the defense in connection with
any and all proceedings (including, without limitation tax audits) and to
promptly provide each other party with any and all notices that may be
received by any of them that could reasonably be expected to result in
a claim for indemnification under this Article XIV.

 

 

14.11 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made by Parties under this Article XIV shall be deemed adjustments
to the Consideration.

 

 

14.12 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, indemnification pursuant
to this Article XIV shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for each Party and
its respective Affiliates with respect to any and all claims based on any
breach of, or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty contained in, this
Agreement.

prior to the issuance of such a report, statement or press release.

Buyer and the Sellers and the Shareholders because of the authorship of any
of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any United States
Federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer

OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).

 

 

15.13 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be
unimpaired, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be
replaced by a mutually acceptable provision, which being valid, legal and
enforceable, comes closest to the economic effect and intent of the parties
underlying the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

 

 

15.14 _Successors and Assigns_. None of the Sellers, the Shareholders or
Buyer shall assign, or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any interest in
or obligation under this Agreement to any other Person; _provided_

15.16 _Guaranty_. Matthews unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the
timely payment and performance of all agreements, covenants, obligations and
liabilities of Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates (and their respective permitted
successors and assigns) under this Agreement and under any other agreement
entered into pursuant to the provisions hereof to which Buyer or an Affiliate
of Buyer and a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller are parties (the "
_Guaranty_ "). The Guaranty is in no way conditioned upon any event or
contingency, and shall be binding upon and enforceable against Matthews
without regard to the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
term hereof or any other agreement, or term thereof, entered into pursuant to
the provisions hereof to which Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer and a Seller or
an Affiliate of a Seller are parties. The obligations of Matthews under the
Guarantee shall be continuing, absolute, unlimited and unconditional, and
shall not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off, deduction or defense based
upon any claim that Matthews may have against the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, and shall remain in full force and without regard to, and, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Laws, shall not be released, discharged or in
any way affected by any circumstance or condition (whether or not Matthews
shall have any knowledge or notice thereof) whatsoever which might constitute
a legal or equitable discharge or defense.
