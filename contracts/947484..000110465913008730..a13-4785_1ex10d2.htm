Payment_ ") equal to the sum of (i) sixty percent (60%) of the difference of
(x) the Estimated Closing Date Book Value determined in accordance with
_Section 2.2(b)_ _minus_ (y) an amount equal to the Seller Capital
Contributions, such amount not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate _minus_
(z) the Estimated Current Affiliate Obligations, to the extent not previously
accrued and reflected in the Estimated Closing Date Book Value, _plus_ (ii)
100% of the aggregate amount of any Seller Capital Contributions, up to
$10,000,000. Such Closing Date Payment shall be subject to adjustment
following Closing in accordance with _Section 2.6_.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Pre-Closing Estimate_. At least five (5) and not more than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver
to the Purchaser a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "),
consisting of (i) an estimate of the combined balance sheets of the CMG
Companies as of the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the
Closing Date (or as of the Closing Date, if the Closing Date falls on the last
day of a calendar month) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be developed
based on the CMG MI balance sheet and the consolidated balance sheet of CMG MA
and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CMG Re, each as of the applicable date) (the
" _CMG Balance Sheet_ "), which CMG Balance Sheet shall be prepared in good
faith, in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with SellersÂ’ past
practice and methodologies, (ii) SellerÂ’s good faith estimate, and a
reasonably detailed calculation, of Book Value as of the last day of the
calendar month immediately preceding the Closing Date (or as of the Closing
Date, if the Closing Date falls on the last day of a calendar month), derived
from such CMG Balance Sheet (as the same may be modified in accordance with
the remaining terms of this _Section 2.2(b)_ ), the " _Estimated Closing Date
Book Value_ ") and (iii) an estimate of the Current Affiliate Obligations ("
_Estimated Current Affiliate Obligations_ "); _provided_ , that the Sellers
and the Purchaser shall work together in good faith following delivery of the
Estimated Closing Statement to resolve any differences between them with
respect to such Estimated Closing Statement; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
unless otherwise agreed by the Purchaser and the Sellers, the Closing shall
not be delayed due to any disagreement over the Estimated Closing Statement
and shall occur even if the Estimated Closing Statement is not reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser.

 



 

(c) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, PMI
shall prepare and deliver, in such form reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser and CUNA Mutual, a flow of funds memorandum containing instructions
(including wire transfer instructions) for the payment of the Closing Date
Payment and any other amounts required to be paid by the Parties pursuant to
the Transaction Documents upon Closing or that the Parties otherwise agree
will be paid upon Closing (such statement, the " _Flow of Funds Memorandum_
"). Such Flow of Funds Memorandum shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser and the Sellers in form and substance.

 



 

(d) Payment of the Closing Date Payment and any other amounts due under this
Agreement shall be in U.S. dollars paid by the party owing such amount by
electronic wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
designated by the applicable party to receive such payment or on whose behalf
such payment is to be made.

 



 

(e) For all Tax purposes, the Purchaser Parties and the Sellers agree to
report the Transaction in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, and agree that none of them will take any position inconsistent
therewith in any Tax Return unless otherwise required by a taxing authority.

 



 

2.3 Escrowed Funds.

 



 

(a) Within one (1) Business Day after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National

substance of _Exhibit G_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") an

 



      
 

 



 

amount in cash equal to $6,000,000 (the " _Deposit_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The Deposit (together with all accrued investment
income or interest thereon) shall be held by the Escrow Agent in trust and
shall be delivered to the Purchaser in the event (i) the Court has not
approved the Transaction pursuant to the Sale Order on or prior to the earlier
of (A) the date that is 120 days from the date of the first Court hearing to
seek approval of the Transaction and (B) August 15, 2013 or (ii) this
Agreement is terminated other than in accordance with _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time the Deposit is due to be
released to the Purchaser pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), (x) the
Purchaser has materially breached any provision of this Agreement, (y) the
Sellers have notified the Purchaser that they intend to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ if such material breach remains
uncured and (z) the cure period relating to such breach contemplated by
_Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ has not yet expired, then the period contemplated by the
foregoing clause (i) shall be extended until the earlier of the date that is
five (5) Business Days following the end of such cure period (it being
understood that the Sellers may have a right to terminate the Agreement during
such five (5) Business Day period following the end of such cure period) and
(B) the date on which the Purchaser has cured such material breach.

 



 

(b) If the Deposit is required to be released to the Purchaser pursuant to the
terms hereof, it shall be released to the Purchaser in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement. If the Closing occurs, and the
Deposit has not been returned to the Purchaser in accordance with _Section
2.3(a)_ , the Deposit will be released to the Sellers on a pro rata basis
based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof, in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and credited against the
Closing Date Payment. The Parties shall take such action as is necessary,
including providing joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, to cause
the Deposit (together with earnings thereon) to be released to the Sellers or
to the Purchaser, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deposit with the
Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement, which shall be in
the form and substance of _Exhibit H_ hereto (the " _Indemnification Escrow
Agreement_ "), for deposit into an escrow fund (the " _Indemnification Escrow
Fund_ ") a portion of the Closing Date Payment equal to twenty million dollars
($20,000,000) (as increased from time to time by the amount of any interest,
dividends, earnings and other income on such amount, the " _Indemnification
Escrow Amount_ "), which amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with _Article XII_ and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement to
secure indemnification obligations of the Sellers under _Article XII_ hereof.

 



 

(d) The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow following the
Closing Date, shall be available to compensate the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect to certain indemnification obligations of the Sellers as
provided in _Article XII_ and shall be released subject to and in accordance
with _Section 12.11_ and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

 



 

2.4 _Closing_. The purchase and sale provided for in this Agreement shall take
place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at the offices of Arnold and
Porter LLP located at 399 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m.
(local time) on the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which all
conditions set forth in _Article IX_ (other than conditions to be satisfied by
the delivery of documents or the payment of money at the Closing, and other

 



      
 

 



 

conditions that, by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived by the
Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof in their sole discretion, or
at such other time, date and place as the parties may agree (the " _Closing
Date_ ").

 



 

2.5 _Right of Set Off_. The Purchaser Parties shall have the right to set off
from any amounts owing by a Purchaser Party to PMI pursuant to this Agreement,
any delinquent amount that is due and owing from PMI or any Affiliate of PMI
to a Purchaser Party or any Affiliate of the Purchaser Parties pursuant to
this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Services Agreement (as
defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) or the Quota Share Reinsurance
Agreement (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement); _provided_ , _however_
, that if PMI or its applicable Affiliate disputes in good faith its
obligation to pay any such amount, then the Purchaser or its Affiliate, as
applicable, shall not be entitled to such right of set-off in respect of such
disputed amount (or the disputed portion of any such amount) unless and until
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such amount or any portion
thereof is due and owing to the Purchaser or the PurchaserÂ’s Affiliate or PMI
and the Purchaser otherwise mutually resolve the dispute; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to
such right of off-set in relation to any (i) Deferred Consideration Payment or
(ii) indemnification claim asserted by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
hereunder or under the Asset Purchase Agreement to the extent that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties are indemnified for Covered Losses that are the
subject of such indemnification claim from the Indemnification Escrow Fund
within the meaning of this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the Purchaser Parties and their
Affiliates shall not have the right to set off from any amounts owing by a
Purchaser Party or an Affiliate of a Purchaser Party to CUNA Mutual pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



 

2.6 _Adjustment of Closing Date Payment_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Sellers a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), consisting
of (i) the combined balance sheets of the CMG Companies as of the last day of
the calendar month immediately preceding the Closing Date (or as of such date,
if the Closing Date falls on the last day of a calendar month) (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, will be developed based on the CMG MI balance sheet as of
the Closing Date and the consolidated balance sheet as of such date of CMG MA
and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CMG Re, (ii) a calculation in reasonable
detail of the Book Value as of the last day of the calendar month immediately
preceding the Closing Date (or as of the Closing Date, if the Closing Date
falls on the last day of a calendar month), derived from such balance sheet ("
_Closing Date Book Value_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of such
calculation, adjustments to the amount of premium deficiency reserves and loss
reserves set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement shall only be made by
the Purchaser in the event such calculations were not derived from the books
and records of the CMG Companies, the Sellers made a manifest arithmetic error
in such calculations, the Sellers deviated from SellersÂ’ past practice and
methodologies or the requirements of _Schedule 1.1(a)_ hereof in making such
calculations, (iii) a statement of the aggregate Current Affiliate Obligations
invoiced to the CMG Companies in accordance with _Section 7.12_ hereof (the "
_Actual Current Affiliate Obligations_ "), and (iv) a calculation of the Final
Closing Payment, which Final Closing Payment shall be determined using the
formula set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ for determining the Closing Date Payment, except
that (A) the Closing Date Book Value set forth in the Closing Statement shall
be substituted for the Estimated Closing Date Book Value in clause (x) and (z)
thereof and (B) the Actual Current Affiliate Obligations shall be substituted
for the Estimated Current Affiliate Obligations in clause (z) thereof. The
balance sheet included in the Closing Statement shall be prepared based upon
the books and records of the CMG Companies and in accordance with GAAP and
SellersÂ’ past practice and methodologies (including for the calculation of
reserves).

 



 

(b) If either Seller in good faith disagrees with all or any portion of the
Closing Statement, then such Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing (the
" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") of such disagreement within forty-five (45) days
after delivery of the Closing Statement. Each Notice of Disagreement shall set
forth in reasonable detail each disputed item or amount and the basis for the
disagreement, together with supporting calculations. Any amount, determination
or calculation contained in the Closing Statement and not specifically
disputed in a timely delivered Notice of Disagreement shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties and not subject to further review. If a
Notice of Disagreement is timely delivered within such forty-five (45) day
period, the Purchaser and such Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
each dispute raised therein (each, an " _Objection_ "). Any such resolution
shall be evidenced in a writing and executed by an authorized representative
of the Purchaser and each Seller. If the Purchaser and such Seller are unable
to resolve any Objections within ten (10) days after delivery of such Notice
of Disagreement, then the Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly engage KPMG
LLP (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") to resolve such Objections (acting as
an expert and not an arbitrator) in accordance with this Agreement as soon as
practicable thereafter, but in any event within thirty (30) days after
engagement of the Independent Accountant. If KPMG LLP is no longer independent
or is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, then the Purchaser and
the Sellers shall select, within ten (10) days after notification that KPMG
LLP is no longer independent or is unwilling or unable to serve in such
capacity, a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized independent accounting
firm to serve as the Independent Accountant. The Sellers and the Purchaser
shall cause the Independent Accountant to deliver a written report containing
its calculation of the disputed Objections (which calculation shall be within
the range of dispute between the Closing Statement and the Notice of
Disagreement) within thirty (30) days after engagement of the Independent
Accountant. The scope of such firmÂ’s engagement (which shall not be an audit)
shall be limited to the resolution of the items contained in the Notice of
Disagreement, and the recalculation, if any, of the Closing Statement in light
of such resolution. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant
shall not make any determination with respect to any matter other than those
matters specifically set forth in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in
dispute at the time of such determination. All Objections that are resolved
between the Parties or are determined by the Independent Accountant in
accordance with this _Section 2.6(b)_ shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon the Parties and shall not be subject to further review absent manifest
error. The fees, costs and expenses of the Purchaser in connection with the
preparation of the Closing Statement shall be borne by the Purchaser Parties,
and the fees, costs and expenses of the Sellers in connection with the
preparation of the Notice of Disagreement shall be borne pro rata by the
Sellers based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof.
The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant, if any, selected
in accordance with this _Section 2.6(b)_ will be paid by the Sellers (on a pro
rata basis based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date
hereof), on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the
percentage which

 



      
 

 



 

the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the
amount actually contested by or on behalf of such Party. Within five (5)
Business Days of the first to occur of either (i) final resolution of the
Closing Statement as described above, and (ii) delivery of a notice of
determination by the Independent Accountant as described above, any adjustment
shall be paid as provided in _Section 2.6(d)_.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser shall make its financial records relating to the calculation
of the Final Closing Payment, accounting personnel and advisors available to
the Sellers, their accountants and other representatives and the Independent
Accountant at reasonable times during normal business hours during the review
by the Sellers and the Independent Accountant of, and the resolution of any
Objections with respect to, the Closing Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser and its representatives will permit
such Persons to review the PurchaserÂ’s work papers and the work papers of the
PurchaserÂ’s independent accountants relating to the preparation of the Closing
Statement, as well as all the books, records and other relevant information
relating to the Shares, and the Purchaser will make available at reasonable
times during normal business hours the individuals then in its employ
primarily responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and
the preparation of, the Closing Statement in order to respond to the
reasonable inquiries of the Sellers; _provided,_ _however_ , that the
independent accountants of the Purchaser Parties will not be obligated to make
any work papers available to the Sellers unless and until such Persons have
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

 



 

(d) _Final Adjustment_. Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing
Statement is finalized pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ :

 



 

(i) if the Final Closing Payment set forth in such Closing Statement exceeds
the Closing Date Payment, the Purchaser shall pay to each Seller an amount
equal to each SellerÂ’s pro rata portion of such excess based upon each
SellerÂ’s pro rata portion of such excess, based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage
Interest as of the date hereof; or

 



 

(ii) if the Closing Date Payment exceeds the Final Closing Date Payment set
forth in such Closing Statement, each Seller shall pay the Purchaser an amount
equal to such SellerÂ’s pro rata portion of such excess based upon each
SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof.

_Pre-Signing Portfolio Schedule_ "), has been previously delivered to the
Purchaser. On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser a

Companies in respect of the first audit of the CMG Companies completed
following the Closing Date, either the Purchaser or the

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers (acting jointly), may notify the other Party in writing that it has
identified one or more inaccuracies in the Closing Portfolio and the
corrections such Party proposes to make to the Closing Portfolio Schedule to
address the same, which notice shall specify such inaccuracies. Not later than
ten (10) Business Days following any such notice, the Party receiving the
notice shall notify the Party that delivered the notice in writing either (x)
that they agree with such inaccuracies and corrections or (y) that they
disagree with one or more of the inaccuracies identified in the notice or the
proposed corrections therefor, specifying the inaccuracies or corrections with
which they disagree. If the Parties agree with any inaccuracy identified in
the notice or the Party receiving such notice fails to respond to such notice
as contemplated by this clause (iii) within the ten (10) Business Day period
contemplated above, the Purchaser shall prepare a corrected Closing Portfolio
Schedule and provide a copy thereof to the Sellers. If the Purchaser and the
Sellers do not agree with the inaccuracy identified in the notice provided
within the ten (10) Business Day period contemplated above, the Purchaser and
the Sellers shall, within ten (10) Business Days following notice of such
disagreement, meet (in person or by teleconference) to discuss such
disagreement and endeavor in good faith to resolve such disagreement. In the
event that the Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to resolve any such
disagreement within ten (10) Business Days following such initial meeting, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to submit such dispute to resolution by an
Independent Accountant in accordance with the procedures and requirements
consistent with those contemplated by _Sections 2.7(d)_ and _2.7(f)_ , as
though such disagreement were a DC Objection. Upon the final resolution of any
disagreement over purported inaccuracies in the Closing Portfolio Schedule,
either by the Purchaser and the Sellers, or by the Independent Accountant, the
Purchaser shall prepare a corrected Closing Portfolio Schedule reflecting such
agreed resolutions and provide a copy thereof to the Sellers. Any corrected
Closing Portfolio Schedule prepared and delivered pursuant to this clause
(iii) shall replace the Closing Portfolio Schedule theretofore in effect.

 



 

(b) _Deferred Consideration Payments_. Within ninety (90) days following each
of the third anniversary, fifth anniversary and sixth anniversary (as may be
extended in accordance with _Section 2.7(e)_ ) of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall pay the Sellers an aggregate amount (each, a " _Deferred
Consideration Payment_ ") equal to (i) the Applicable Percentage _multiplied
by_ (ii) the difference between (A) the Adjusted Book Value as of the
applicable anniversary date and (B) the sum of the Final Closing Payment
_minus_ any Seller Capital Contributions, up to $10,000,000 in the aggregate,
and all Deferred Consideration Payments prior to the date of the Deferred
Consideration Payment to be made in respect of such anniversary; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the amount of any Deferred Consideration
Payment, when combined with the Final Closing Payment and all prior Deferred
Consideration Payments exceed one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Closing
Date Book Value _less_ any Seller Capital Contributions made prior to Closing,
up to $10,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Deferred Consideration Cap_ "),
_provided_ , _further_ , that solely for purposes of calculating the Deferred
Consideration Cap, the premium deficiency reserve amount as of the Closing
Date, if any, shall be recalculated on a combined basis for the CMG Companies
and, if such recalculated premium deficiency reserve amount is less than the
premium deficiency reserve amount contemplated in the calculation of the
Closing Date Book Value, the difference shall be added to the Closing Date
Book Value for the purpose of calculating the Deferred Consideration Cap. In
the event a Deferred Consideration Payment would exceed the Deferred
Consideration Cap, the

 



      
 

 



 

amount of such Deferred Consideration Payment shall equal (1) the Deferred
Consideration Cap _minus_ (2) the sum of the Final Closing Payment _minus_ any
Seller Capital Contributions, up to $10,000,000 in the aggregate, and all
prior Deferred Consideration Payments; and _provided_ _further_ , that if the
calculation of any Deferred Consideration Payment pursuant to this _Section
2.7_ results in a negative number, such Deferred Consideration Payment shall
be $0. For the sake of clarity, if the Deferred Consideration Payment in
respect of either the third anniversary or the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, when combined with the Final Closing Payment _minus_ any Seller
Capital Contributions, up to $10,000,000 in the aggregate, and all prior
Deferred Consideration Payments, exceeds the Deferred Consideration Cap, then
no additional Deferred Consideration Payment(s) shall be owing pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Calculation and Reporting_. On or prior to the date on which each
Deferred Consideration Payment is made pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ , the
Purchaser shall provide each Seller with a written statement (each, a "
_Deferred Consideration Statement_ ") consisting of (i) a calculation in
reasonable detail of the Adjusted Book Value as of such date, as well as each
component of Adjusted Book Value, as contemplated by the definition thereof,
with such supporting details of the calculation as may be reasonably requested
by the Sellers, and (ii) a calculation of the Deferred Consideration Payment
to be made in respect of such date. Each calculation of Adjusted Book Value
shall be made in accordance with the principles set forth on _Schedule 2.7(c)_
hereto. A hypothetical calculation of Adjusted Book Value is set forth on
_Schedule 2.7(c)_ hereto for illustrative purposes only. The Parties agree
that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes
of determining or calculating Adjusted Book Value as of any date, any
Liability that constitutes a Covered Loss shall be disregarded to the extent
that the Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party has theretofore been
indemnified for such Covered Loss pursuant to _Article XII_.

 



 

(d) _Resolution of Disputes_. (b) If either Seller in good faith disagrees
with all or any portion of any Deferred Consideration Statement, then such
Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") of
such disagreement within forty-five (45) days after delivery of such Deferred
Consideration Statement. Each Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail each disputed item or amount and the basis for the disagreement,
together with supporting calculations. Any amount, determination or
calculation contained in the applicable Deferred Consideration Statement and
not specifically disputed in a timely delivered Dispute Notice shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties and not subject to further review. If a
Dispute Notice is timely delivered within such forty-five (45) day period, the
Purchaser and such Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve each
dispute raised therein (each, a " _DC Objection_ "). Any such resolution shall
be evidenced in a writing and executed by an authorized representative of the
Purchaser and each Seller. If the Purchaser and such Seller are unable to
resolve any DC Objections within ten (10) days after delivery of such Dispute
Notice, then the Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly engage an Independent
Accountant to resolve such DC Objections (acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator) in accordance with this Agreement as soon as practicable
thereafter, but in any event within thirty (30) days after engagement of the
Independent Accountant. Such Independent Accountant shall be the Independent
Accountant contemplated or selected pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_. If such
Independent Accountant is no longer deemed independent, or is unwilling or
unable to serve in such capacity, then the Purchaser and the Sellers shall
select, within ten (10) days after notification that such Independent
Accountant is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, a mutually
acceptable,

 



      
 

 



 

nationally recognized independent accounting firm to serve as the Independent
Accountant for purposes of resolving such dispute. The Sellers and the
Purchaser shall cause the Independent Accountant to deliver a written report
containing its calculation of the disputed DC Objections (which calculation
shall be within the range of dispute between the Deferred Consideration
Statement and the Dispute Notice) within thirty (30) days after engagement of
the Independent Accountant. The scope of such firmÂ’s engagement (which shall
not be an audit) shall be limited to the resolution of the items contained in
the Dispute Notice, and the recalculation, if any, of the Deferred
Consideration Statement in light of such resolution. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not make any determination with
respect to any matter other than those matters specifically set forth in the
Dispute Notice that remain in dispute at the time of such determination. All
DC Objections that are resolved between the Parties or are determined by the
Independent Accountant in accordance with this _Section 2.7(d)_ shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon the Parties and shall not be subject to
further review absent manifest error. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Purchaser Parties in connection with the preparation of the Deferred
Consideration Statement shall be borne by the Purchaser, and the fees, costs
and expenses of the Sellers in connection with the preparation of the Dispute
Notice shall be borne pro rata by the Sellers based upon each SellerÂ’s
Percentage Interest as of the date hereof. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountant, if any, selected in accordance with this _Section
2.7(d)_ will be paid by the Sellers (on a pro rata basis based upon each
SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof), on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually
contested by or on behalf of such Party. Within five (5) Business Days of the
first to occur of either (i) final resolution of the Deferred Consideration
Statement as described above, and (ii) delivery of a notice of determination
by the Independent Accountant as described above, any adjustment shall be paid
as provided in _Section 2.7(g)_.

 



 

(e) In connection with the Deferred Consideration Statement delivered by the
Purchaser with respect to the Deferred Consideration Payment to be made with
respect to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, in the event the
Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to resolve any DC Objections within ten
(10) days after delivery of such Dispute Notice, then the Sellers shall have
the one-time option, in their sole discretion, to extend the duration of the
deferred consideration period contemplated by _Section 2.7(a)(i)(C)_ for an
additional period ending on the first, second or third anniversary of such
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date on the terms hereof (such period, the "
_Extension Period_ ") such that the calculation of the Adjusted Book Value
shall be as of the last day of such additional period; _provided_ , that the
Sellers deliver a joint notice in writing to the Purchaser within two (2)
Business Days following the last day of such ten (10) day period. In the event
the Sellers exercise their option to extend the duration of the deferred
consideration period, the Parties agree that the covenants set forth in
_Section 7.17_ shall survive during such Extension Period. Anything to the
contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the final deferred consideration
period is extended as contemplated by this _Section 2.7(e)_ , no net operating
loss carryforwards of the CMG Companies utilized after the sixth anniversary
of the Closing Date shall be considered in the calculation of the final
Deferred Consideration Payment.

 



 

(f) The Purchaser shall make its financial records relating to the calculation
of each Deferred Consideration Payment, accounting personnel and advisors
available to the Sellers, their accountants and other representatives and the
Independent Accountant at reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

times during normal business hours during the review by the Sellers and the
Independent Accountant of, and the resolution of any DC Objections with
respect to, the Deferred Consideration Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser and its representatives will permit
such Persons to review the PurchaserÂ’s work papers and the work papers of the
PurchaserÂ’s independent accountants relating to the preparation of each
Deferred Consideration Statement, as well as all the books, records and other
relevant information relating to the Shares, and the Purchaser will make
available at reasonable times during normal business hours the individuals
then in its employ primarily responsible for and knowledgeable about the
information used in, and the preparation of, the applicable Deferred
Consideration Statement in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of the
Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants of the
Purchaser will not be obligated to make any work papers available to the
Sellers unless and until such Persons have signed a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent accountants.

 



 

(g) _Final Adjustment_. Within five (5) Business Days after any dispute over
any Deferred Consideration Statement is resolved pursuant to this _Section
2.7_ :

 



 

(i) if the Deferred Consideration Payment that should have been made to
Sellers in respect of the applicable anniversary date, based upon any
adjustments made to the corresponding Deferred Consideration Statement
pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ exceeds the Deferred Consideration Payment that
has been made to Sellers in respect of such anniversary date, the Purchaser
shall pay to each Seller an amount equal to each SellerÂ’s pro rata portion of
such excess based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date
hereof; or

 



 

(ii) if the Deferred Consideration Payment that has been made to Sellers in
respect of the applicable anniversary date exceeds the Deferred Consideration
Payment that should have been made to Sellers in respect of such anniversary
date, based upon any adjustments made to the corresponding Deferred
Consideration Statement pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ , each Seller shall pay
to the Purchaser an amount equal to each SellerÂ’s pro rata portion of such
excess based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof.

 



 

2.8 _Tax Withholding_. The Purchaser Parties shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the
Sellers for all purposes of this Agreement.

Purchaser, at the PurchaserÂ’s expense, to obtain a protective order or similar
remedy to cause such Purchaser Confidential Information not to be disclosed,
including interposing all available objections thereto. In the event that such
protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained, such Seller and its
Affiliates shall furnish only that portion of Purchaser Confidential
Information that has been legally compelled. For purposes of this _Section
7.1(c)_, from and after the date hereof, " _Purchaser Confidential
Information_ " means any and all non-public information and materials of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including any such information and
materials obtained by either Seller or their Representatives in connection
with the PurchaserÂ’s and its AffiliatesÂ’ consideration, negotiation and
performance of the Transaction Documents and the Transaction Documents
contemplated under the Asset Purchase Agreement, information and materials
relating to the PurchaserÂ’s or its Affiliates strategic, business and other
plans for the Business, or their non-public communications with, discussions
with, and submissions to Governmental Entities. From and after the Closing,
"Purchaser Confidential Information" shall also include Business Confidential
Information.

 



 

(d) During the period prior to Closing, the Sellers shall retain all of their
respective books, records, documentation, manuals, files and information
relating to the CMG Companies, the CMG Business and Shares.

 



 

(e) Each Seller and the Purchaser shall each designate a person to act as the
representative for such Party or Parties for purposes of coordinating with the
other Party or Parties in connection with activities and conduct necessary or
appropriate to effect the closing of the Transaction and to transition the CMG
Business from the Sellers to the Purchaser. PMI initially designates Truitte
Todd as its representative. CUNA Mutual initially designates John Lass as its
representative. The Purchaser initially designates David Gansberg as its
representative. The representatives shall meet or otherwise communicate with
each other on a regular basis.

 



 

(f) The Purchaser agrees that following the Closing Date, subject to _Section
7.1(c)_, the Sellers and their Representatives shall have reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to the books, records, documentation, policies,
procedures, manuals, files and other

 



      
 

 



 

information or data of Purchaser to the extent they relate to the CMG
Companies, CMG Business or the Shares during the period prior to the Closing
Date (and shall permit such Persons to examine and copy such books, records,
documentation, policies, procedures, manuals, files and other information or
data to the extent reasonably requested by such Persons), and shall cause
their respective officers and employees to furnish (to the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, or any regulator of either Seller or any of its Affiliates)
all information reasonably requested by the Sellers, and otherwise reasonably
cooperate with (including, without limitation, by requiring such employees to
make themselves reasonably available for trial, depositions, interviews and
other litigation-related endeavors) the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
with respect to the CMG Business or the Shares, in connection with regulatory
compliance, pending or threatened third party litigation, financial reporting
and tax matters (including financial and tax audits and tax contests) and
other similar business purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that the applicable
Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser and their respective employees for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by them in
providing such assistance and cooperation, but, in the case of PMI, only to
the extent that such costs and expenses are not reimbursed pursuant to the
Services Agreement (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement). For a period
required under the longer of the PurchaserÂ’s record retention policy or seven
(7) years from the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not destroy or dispose of
or permit the destruction or disposition of any such books, records,
documentation, manuals, files and other information or data without first
offering, in writing, at least sixty (60) days prior to such destruction or
disposition to surrender them to the Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 7.1(f)_, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not
be required to provide access to or disclose information where such access or
disclosure would result in the waiver by the Purchaser of the privilege
protecting communications between the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and
any of its counsel, or would be contrary to any Law applicable to the
Purchaser and its Affiliates.

 



 

(g) Each Seller agrees that following the Closing Date, the Purchaser and its
Representatives shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
the books, records, documentation, policies, procedures, manuals, files and
other information or data of the Sellers to the extent they relate to the CMG
Companies, CMG Business, the Shares, the Transferred Employees or the
Transferred Contractors (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) during
the period prior to the Closing Date (and shall permit such Persons to examine
and copy such books, records, documentation, policies, procedures, manuals,
files and other information or data of the Sellers to the extent reasonably
requested by such Persons), p _rovided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller
shall be required to provide access to the personnel records of any Business
Employee that is not a Transferred Employee without such employeeÂ’s prior
written consent (and neither Seller shall have any obligation to request such
consent), and each Seller shall cause its officers and employees to furnish
(to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any regulator of the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates) all information reasonably requested by the
Purchaser, and otherwise reasonably cooperate with (including, without
limitation, causing employees to assist the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
by requiring such employees to make themselves reasonably available for trial,
depositions, interviews and other litigation-related endeavors) the Purchaser
and its Affiliates and Representatives with respect to the CMG Business or the
Shares, the Transferred Employees or the Transferred Contractors, in
connection with regulatory compliance, pending or threatened third party
litigation, financial reporting and tax matters (including financial and tax
audits and tax contests) and other similar business purposes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall reimburse the Sellers and their employees

 



      
 

 



 

for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
them in providing such assistance and cooperation, but only to the extent that
such costs and expenses are not reimbursed pursuant to the Services Agreement.
For a period required under the longer of the respective SellerÂ’s record
retention policy or seven (7) years from the Closing Date, such Seller shall
not destroy or dispose of or permit the destruction or disposition of any such
books, records, documentation, manuals, files and other information or data
without first offering, in writing, at least sixty (60) days prior to such
destruction or disposition to surrender them to the Purchaser. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.1(g)_, the Sellers and their
Affiliates shall not be required to provide access to or disclose information
where such access or disclosure would result in the waiver by the Sellers of
the privilege protecting communications between the Sellers and any of their
counsel, or would be contrary to any Law applicable to the Sellers and their
Affiliates.

 



 

7.2 _Supplements to Disclosure Schedules_. Prior to the Closing, each Seller
shall supplement or amend the PMI Disclosure Schedule, the CUNA Mutual
Disclosure Schedule or the Seller Disclosure Schedule in the event that it
discovers any matter that was required to be set forth or described on such
schedules, but was omitted therefrom, or determines that there is otherwise
any inaccuracy in such schedule. The Sellers shall promptly notify the
Purchaser Parties in writing of the supplement or amendment of such schedules.
No such supplement or amendment of the PMI Disclosure Schedule, the CUNA
Mutual Disclosure Schedule or the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall cure any
breach of this Agreement or limit or affect any right the Purchaser may have
hereunder by virtue of such breach. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, for all purposes of this Agreement, including _Article IX_ and
_Article XII_, any failure of the Sellers to perform their obligations under,
or to comply with, this _Section 7.2_ shall be deemed a breach of a
representation or warranty and not a failure to perform or comply with a
covenant or agreement.

 



 

7.3 _Conduct of the CMG Business Prior to Closing_. From and after the date
hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms or the Closing Date, except (i) as contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) as required by Law or by a Final Order, or (iii) to the extent
the Purchaser Parties provide prior written consent to do otherwise, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and subject to any applicable
orders of the Court, the Sellers shall, and shall cause the CMG Companies to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to:

 



 

(a) maintain the corporate existence of the CMG Companies and all Permits
required for the conduct of the CMG Business;

 



 

(b) maintain the general character of the CMG Business and conduct the CMG
Business in the ordinary course, consistent with past practices, other than in

infusions by either Seller that the Sellers reasonably deem necessary in order
for the applicable CMG Company to comply with applicable minimum capital
requirements imposed by Law or any Governmental Entity or the Capital Support
Agreement between the Sellers and CMG MI (any such capital infusion, a "
_Seller Capital Contribution_ ");

 



 

(c) maintain proper business and accounting records relative to the CMG
Business;

this Agreement, (ii) as required by Law or by a Final Order, (iii) as
otherwise set forth on Section 7.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or (iv)

any Material Contract, other than to extend any such Contract, in the ordinary
course of business, that is expected to expire or terminate by its terms prior

such extended Contract shall result in annual costs to the CMG Companies in
excess of one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the cost for the final year of
the Contract prior to such ContractÂ’s termination of expiration; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the expiration of any such Contract by its terms prior to
Closing shall be deemed not to be a termination of such Contract under this

connection with any intercompany agreements between a CMG Company and one or

7.5 _[Reserved]_.

 



 

7.6 _Efforts and Actions to Cause the Closing to Occur; Consents_.

 



 

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including clauses (ii) through (iv) of _Section 7.6(c)_, the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done and
cooperate with each other in order to do all things, necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied, to
consummate the Closing and to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, including (i) the preparation and
filing of all forms, registrations, notices and other documentation required
to be filed to consummate the Closing and to effectuate the Transaction and
the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain all Governmental
Approvals and Third Party Consents, _provided,_ that, except as expressly
contemplated by _Section 7.6(c)_, neither the Sellers, on the one hand, nor
the Purchaser Parties, on the other, shall be obligated to make any material
payment or deliver anything of material value to any third party in connection
with obtaining a Third Party Consent, (ii) seeking to prevent the initiation
of, and defend, any Action challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Closing, and (iii) seeking the lifting or rescission of any Order
adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the Closing.

 



 

(b) _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties_. In furtherance and not in
limitation of _Section 7.6(a)_, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate
with each other and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Third Party Consents and such other consents of third parties (for
purposes of this _Section 7.6(b)_, other than Governmental Entities) as are
necessary to permit the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance to the
Purchaser of the Shares and the consummation of the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (which, for the
avoidance of doubt shall not include the Asset Purchase Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents that are contemplated
by the Asset Purchase Agreement, which are not also Transaction

 



      
 

 



 

Documents within the meaning of this Agreement). If any such consent is not
obtained prior to the Closing or does not remain in full force and effect at
the Closing, the Purchaser and the Sellers will, to the extent necessary, use
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a mutually agreeable and lawful
arrangement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing, under which
the Purchaser or the applicable CMG Company would obtain the benefit and
assume the obligations in respect of the applicable Contract from and after
the Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement, and under which the
Sellers would enforce for the benefit of the Purchaser any and all rights of
the applicable CMG Company against a third party thereto, with the applicable
CMG Company assuming the obligations to the same extent as if the Parties had
obtained such consent. Each Party will bear and be responsible for the costs
of its own personnel, counsel and other advisors associated with obtaining
such consents.

 



 

(c) _Governmental Approvals_.

 



 

(i) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 7.6(a)_, the Sellers and
the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation to obtain the Governmental Approvals. The Sellers and the
Purchaser will furnish each other and each otherÂ’s counsel with all reasonable
information concerning themselves, their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, stockholders or equityholders and such other matters as may be
necessary or advisable in connection with any application, petition or other
statement made by or on behalf of the Sellers or the Purchaser to Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac or any Insurance Regulator or other Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transaction or the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, including, but not limited to, the Sellers making
available to the Purchaser any and all policies, procedures and documentation
that may be useful to the Purchaser in developing its policies, procedures and
business practices for submission to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. PMI and CUNA
Mutual shall each prepare and submit the necessary documentation to obtain the
PMI Required Governmental Approvals and the CUNA Mutual Required Governmental
Approvals, respectively, and, collectively, shall prepare and submit the
necessary documentation to obtain the CMG Required Governmental Approvals and
the Purchaser shall prepare and submit the necessary documentation to obtain
the Purchaser Required Governmental Approvals. Each Party acknowledges that
time is of the essence in connection with the preparation and filing of the
documentation referred to above. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall each have
the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to it and its Affiliates which appear in any filing made
in connection with the Transaction with any Governmental Entity and, to the
extent practicable, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall provide to each other
Party the non-confidential portions of any application for approval being made
in connection with the Transaction with any Governmental Entity reasonably
prior to the time such filing is made such that such other PartyÂ’s reasonable
comments may be considered in good faith by the filing Party prior to making
such filing. In addition, the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on
the other, shall each furnish to the other a copy of each publicly available
portion of such filing made in connection with the Transaction with any
Governmental Entity promptly after its filing. The Sellers and the Purchaser
agree to (x) keep each other reasonably informed of any communication received
from, or given to, any Governmental Entity regarding any Governmental
Approval, and (y) consult with each other in advance

 



      
 

 



 

of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity in respect of any
Governmental Approval and, to the extent not prohibited by such applicable
Governmental Entity, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

 



 

(ii) Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 7.6(c)_ and Section
6.8(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser, (A) confirms that it
has reviewed the published and publicly available requirements of Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac and, as applicable, other Governmental Entities with respect to
obtaining the applicable Governmental Approvals and has consulted with legal
and other advisors in connection with same and (B) agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to accept and comply, and cause its Affiliates to use
their reasonable best efforts to accept and comply, with any condition or
requirement (other than any conditions or requirements that relate to raising,
contributing, committing, or maintaining capital or funding, maintaining
capital ratios or are otherwise financial in nature, which conditions and
requirements are addressed exclusively in clause (iii) of this _Section
7.6(c)_) imposed or sought to be imposed by any Governmental Entity on, to, or
as part of, its approval of the Transaction or the transactions contemplated
by the other Transaction Documents, provided that such condition or
requirement is generally consistent with the conditions and requirements
imposed on other participants in the mortgage insurance industry during the
past five (5) years by such Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Purchaser shall not be obligated to agree to or comply with any such
condition or requirement to the extent such condition or requirement has or is
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on (1) the Purchaser and
its Affiliates, including the Purchaser Parent, taken as a whole, (2) the CMG
Companies, PMAC, the PMI Business, and the CMG Business, taken as a whole or
(3) the financial benefits reasonably expected to be derived from the
Transaction by the Purchaser and its Affiliates.

 



 

(iii) The Purchaser acknowledges that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and/or other
Governmental Entities may require that the Purchaser commit to contribute
capital, or make capital available, to the CMG Companies and/or PMAC at or
following Closing, or impose other conditions relating to maintaining capital
ratios or that are otherwise financial in nature, as a condition on, to or as
part of their approval of the Transaction, the transactions contemplated by
the other Transaction Documents, or the expansion of the CMG business plan to
include issuing insurance policies to non-credit union customers. Any such
requirement or condition, as described in the immediately preceding sentence,
is referred to as a " _Financial Condition_." Purchaser shall (A) acting
reasonably and in good faith, consider and discuss with the applicable
Governmental Entities any such proposed Financial Conditions and (B) accept
and comply with any Financial Condition sought to be imposed, following any
discussions between Purchaser and the applicable Governmental Entities,
provided that such Financial Condition, when considered together with all
other Financial Conditions sought to be imposed, is reasonably appropriate
(taking into account CMG MIÂ’s business as of the Closing and the business plan
for the CMG Companies included in the applicable application or submission to
the relevant Governmental Entit(ies) in connection with obtaining the
Purchaser Required Governmental Approvals, which business plan shall be
prepared by Purchaser in good faith) to support CMG MIÂ’s maintenance of risk-
to-capital ratios following Closing that

 



      
 

 



 

are generally consistent with risk-to-capital ratios maintained by other
active U.S. mortgage insurers who are in compliance with state minimum
statutory or regulatory capital requirements (without reference to any waiver
of such requirements issued by their domiciliary stateÂ’s department of
insurance), considered collectively, unless such acceptance or compliance with
such Financial Condition and all other Financial Conditions sought to be
imposed by Governmental Entities upon Purchaser, its Affiliates, PMAC or the
CMG Companies, taken together, has adversely affected in any material respect,
or is reasonably expected to adversely affect in any material respect, (1) the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the Purchaser Parent, taken as a
whole, (2) the CMG Companies, PMAC, the PMI Business, and the CMG Business,
taken as a whole or (3) the financial benefits reasonably expected to be
derived from the Transaction by Purchaser and its Affiliates.

 



 

(iv) Any condition or requirement of any Governmental Entity imposed or sought
to be imposed upon Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser, PMAC or any CMG
Company as a condition on, to, or as part of its approval of the Transaction,
the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction Documents, or the
expansion of the CMG business plan to include issuing insurance policies to
non-credit union customers that is inconsistent with, exceeds, or is outside
the scope of the requirements and conditions which the Purchaser has agreed to
accept or comply with or to use efforts to accept or comply with, pursuant to
clause (ii) and clause (iii) of this _Section 7.6(c)_ is referred to herein
as an " _Adverse Governmental Requirement_." Anything to the contrary
notwithstanding, Purchaser shall have sole and absolute discretion regarding
whether or not to accept or comply with any Adverse Governmental Requirement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Purchaser determines not to
accept or comply with an Adverse Governmental Requirement, Purchaser shall (A)
provide to the Sellers a copy of such Adverse Governmental Requirement (if the
Purchaser was advised of such Adverse Governmental Requirement in writing)
within five (5) Business Days after such determination by Purchaser, (B)
provide the Sellers with ten (10) Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice of its
intention to advise the applicable Governmental Entity that Purchaser will not
accept or comply with such Adverse Governmental Requirement, and (C)
reasonably cooperate with the Sellers during such period to determine if there
are any mutually acceptable measures that may be taken to mitigate or
eliminate the impact of such Adverse Governmental Requirement and otherwise
satisfy the conditions to Closing hereunder.

 



 

7.7 _Notification_.

 



 

(a) In the event that either Seller or either Purchaser Party determines in
good faith that a condition to any PartyÂ’s obligation to complete the
Transaction cannot be fulfilled, it will promptly notify the other Parties. In
addition, if a Party has the right to waive such condition, but determines it
will not waive such condition, it shall promptly notify the other Parties.

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall promptly inform the Purchaser Parties upon receiving
notice of any legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings,
demands, notices, audits or investigations (by any federal, state or local
commission, agency or board) relating to the alleged

 



      
 

 



 

liability of any Seller under any labor or employment Law with respect to the
Business Employees or the Business Contractors.

 



 

7.8 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) PMI shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be
timely filed after the date of this Agreement (A) any Tax Returns, with
respect to the CMG Companies, the due date of which is on or prior to the
Closing Date and (B) any income Tax Returns of the CMG Companies for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be
paid, all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. To the extent reasonably
requested by the Sellers, the Purchaser Parties shall cooperate with PMI in
the preparation and timely filing of all such Tax Returns, which shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise required
by applicable Laws. PMI shall submit such income Tax Returns, or in the case
of a consolidated or combined income Tax Return, the portion of any such
consolidated Tax Return that relates to the CMG Companies, to the Purchaser
Parties at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for the filing of such
income or consolidated or combined income Tax Returns (taking into account any
extensions) for its review and timely comment; PMI shall reflect reasonable
comments from the Purchaser Parties to the extent such comments are consistent
with the standard set forth in the previous sentence, _provided_ that such
comments do not increase the SellersÂ’ Tax Liabilities with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser Parties shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely
file or cause to be timely filed after the date of this Agreement (A) any Tax
Returns of the CMG Companies for all Straddle Periods (as defined below) and
(B) any non-income Tax Returns of the CMG Companies for all periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date, the due date (including extensions of time to
file) of which is after the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Post-Closing
Tax Returns_ "). All such Post-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the past practice unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws. In the event there are any non-income Tax Returns in respect
of a Straddle Period (" _Straddle Tax Returns_ "), the Purchaser Parties shall
submit each such Straddle Tax Returns to the Sellers at least twenty (20) days
or, in the case of non-income Tax Straddle Tax Returns, at least three (3)
days prior to the due date for the filing of such Straddle Tax Returns (taking
into account any extensions), and the Sellers shall have the right to review
and timely comment on such Straddle Tax Returns; the Purchaser Parties shall
reflect reasonable comments from the Sellers on such Straddle Tax Returns to
the extent such comments are consistent with the standard set forth in the
previous sentence.

 



 

(c) In the case of any claim with respect to Taxes (any such claim a " _Tax
Claim_ ") associated with the CMG Companies after the Closing Date that
relates solely to Taxes for which the Purchaser Parties intends to seek
indemnification pursuant to _Article XII_, the Sellers shall control the
conduct of such Tax Claim at their own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) the Purchaser Parties and its counsel shall have the right to fully
participate in any Tax Claim at the Purchaser PartiesÂ’ own expense, and (ii)
the Sellers shall not discharge, settle or otherwise dispose of any such Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of the Purchaser Parties, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the Sellers fail to assume control of the conduct of any such Tax Claim
within ninety (90) days

 



      
 

 



 

following the receipt of notice of such Tax Claim, the Purchaser Parties shall
have the right to assume control of such Tax Claim and shall be able to
discharge, settle or otherwise dispose of any such Tax Claim in its sole
discretion; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Sellers shall in any event
control the conduct of any such Tax Claim that relates to Taxes imposed on the
Sellers (or that may affect Taxes of the Sellers or a member of the combined
or consolidated group that includes the Sellers) or that relates to a combined
or consolidated Tax Return that includes the Sellers or that relates to a
consolidated or combined Tax Return that includes the CMG Companies on or
prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) In the case of any Tax Claim after the Closing Date with respect both to
Taxes for which the Purchaser Parties intend to seek indemnification pursuant
to _Article XII_ and Taxes for which the Purchaser Parties do not intend to
seek (or are not entitled to seek) indemnification pursuant to _Article XII_,
the Purchaser Parties shall control the conduct of such Tax Action at its own
expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Sellers and their counsel shall
have the right to fully participate in any such Tax Claim at their own
expense, and (ii) the Purchaser Parties shall not discharge, settle or
otherwise dispose of any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(e) After the Closing Date, except as provided in (c) and (d) above, the
Purchaser Parties shall control and shall have the right to discharge, settle
or otherwise dispose of all other Tax Claims with respect to the CMG
Companies.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any taxable period that
begins before, but ends after, the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be calculated
as follows: the amount of any Taxes that are based upon or measured by income,
receipts, profits or wages, that are imposed in connection with the sale or
other transfer of property or services, or that are required to be withheld
and collected, the amount of such Taxes that are attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined on the basis of a closing of the books
as of the end of the day before the Closing Date, and the amount of other
Taxes of the Sellers attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall equal
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period through and
including the day before the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in the taxable period.

 



 

(g) Each of the Purchaser Parties and the Sellers shall promptly notify the
other Parties in writing of the commencement of any Tax Claim of which such
Party or any of its respective Affiliates has been informed in writing by any
Governmental Entity relating to Tax Returns of the CMG Companies for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or of any such Tax Claim that could reasonably be expected
to result in an indemnification obligation under this Agreement. Such notice
shall describe the asserted Tax Claim in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notices and other documents received from any Governmental
Entity in respect thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the
notified Party to give the other Party notice as provided herein shall not
relieve such other Party of its obligations under this _Section 7.8_, except
to the extent that such other Party is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) All stamp, recordation, transfer, excise, documentary, sales, use,
registration and other such taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction
(collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid 50% by the Purchaser
and 50% by the Sellers on a pro rata basis based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage
Interest as of the date hereof. The Purchaser shall properly file on a timely
basis all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any
Transfer Tax and provide to the Sellers evidence of timely filing and payment
of all Transfer Taxes. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize,
to the fullest extent possible under applicable Law, the amount of any such
Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(i) The Purchaser and the Sellers will each provide the other parties with
such cooperation as may reasonably be requested in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return relating to the CMG Companies, or the audit or
other examination by any Governmental Entity or judicial or administrative
Proceeding relating to Liability for Taxes of the CMG Companies.

 



 

(j) Neither the Purchaser Parties, nor any of its Affiliates, nor the Sellers
shall make an election with respect to the CMG Companies under Code Section
338.

 



 

(k) The Sellers shall be entitled to any credits and refunds (including
interest received thereon) in respect of Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
If the Purchaser shall become aware that any of the CMG Companies is entitled
to claim a refund from a Governmental Entity in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers of the availability of
such refund or credit claim and, unless in the PurchaserÂ’s reasonable judgment
making such claim would be materially adverse to any CMG Company or any of
their Affiliates, shall make a timely claim to such Governmental Entity for
such refund. If any of the CMG Companies receives a refund (including pursuant
to a claim for refund made pursuant to the preceding sentence), in respect of
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the CMG Companies shall, and the Purchaser shall
cause the CMG Companies to, within fifteen (15) days of the date such receipt,
pay the amount of such refund to the Sellers on a pro rata basis based upon
each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof, including any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Entity with respect to such refund.

 



 

7.9 _Further Assistance and Assurances_. The Sellers shall, at any time and
from time to time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, following the
Closing), promptly, upon the reasonable request of the Purchaser, execute,
acknowledge, deliver or perform all such further acts, deeds, assignments,
transfers, conveyances and assurances as are reasonably necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this Agreement or as may be required for the better
vesting or conferring to the Purchaser of title in and to the Shares and to
effect the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents. The Purchaser shall, at any time and from time to time,
promptly, upon the reasonable request of the Sellers (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, reasonable requests by either Seller following the
Closing), execute, acknowledge, deliver or perform all such further acts,
deeds, assumption agreements, transfers and assurances as are reasonably
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement and to effect the
Transaction. Each Party agrees that if it receives any payment or amount after
the Closing Date to which another Party is entitled, the recipient shall
promptly transfer such payment or amount to the Party so entitled.

 



       
 

 



 

7.10 _Indemnification Escrow Agreement_. Any fees due and payable to the
Escrow Agent under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement (the " _Escrow Agent
Fees_ ") shall be paid in full on or prior to the Closing Date; it being
agreed that the Purchaser shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the
Escrow Agent Fees and that the Sellers shall be responsible for the other
fifty percent (50%) of the Escrow Agent Fees on a pro rata basis based upon
each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof.

 



 

7.11 _Investments_. Following receipt of all Governmental Approvals and prior
to the Closing, the Sellers shall take such actions as are necessary to cause
the CMG CompaniesÂ’ Investments to consist solely of the types of investments
set forth in _Schedule 7.11_ , other than the Governmental Deposits. Without
limiting the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the CMG
Companies to sell, transfer or exchange any Investments, other than
Governmental Deposits, that are not the types of investments set forth on
_Schedule 7.11_.

 



 

7.12 _Termination of Joint Venture Agreements and Affiliate Transactions_. At
or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall terminate the Joint Venture
Agreements and all Affiliate Transactions, except as set forth on Section 7.12
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and each Seller and the CMG Companies shall
execute, and the Sellers will cause their applicable Affiliates to execute, a
termination and release agreement, which shall be in the form and substance
attached as _Exhibit I_ hereto (the " _Releases_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for a period of thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall be permitted to invoice the CMG Companies for any accrued and
unpaid amounts owing to Sellers or their Affiliates (other than any of the CMG
Companies) pursuant to and in accordance with the Joint Venture Agreements,
solely to the extent that such amounts relate to the period prior to Closing
(collectively, the " _Current Affiliate Obligations_ "). Any Current Affiliate
Obligation not invoiced to the CMG Companies prior to the expiration of such
thirty (30) day period shall be deemed discharged and the relevant Seller or
its Affiliate shall forfeit any rights it may have to recover the same.
Sellers agree not to seek and to cause their Affiliates not to seek any
recovery of any such forfeited amount from the CMG Companies, Purchaser or any
of their Affiliates. Purchaser shall cause the applicable CMG Companies to pay
all Current Affiliate Obligations invoiced in accordance with this _Section
7.12_ within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of the corresponding
invoice.

 



 

7.13 [ _Reserved_ ].

 



 

7.14 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.14(b)_ and _Section 7.14(f)_:

 



 

(i) each Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing as
of the date of this Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and any
discussions that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal;

 



 

(ii) each Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly
take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal or the

 



      
 

 



 

making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish any confidential information relating to either
Seller, PMAC or the CMG Companies or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of any of Sellers or the CMG Companies
to, any third party for the purpose of knowingly facilitating an Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (C) or approve, endorse or enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, purchase agreement, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating
to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that is intended to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal or requires the Sellers to terminate this Agreement
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); and

 



 

(iii) following the date on which PMI receives Court approval pursuant to a
Sale Order, the Sellers shall promptly request in writing that each Previous
Bidder and its Representatives return to the Sellers or destroy all
confidential information and materials furnished to such Previous Bidders.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 7.14(a)_, if, on or prior to date on which PMI
receives Court approval pursuant to the Sale Order, either Seller or any of
their Representatives has received a written Acquisition Proposal from an
unaffiliated third party that meets the criteria of a qualified bidder as set
forth on _Schedule 7.14_ hereto (a " _Potential Buyer_ "), which was not
initiated or solicited in breach of this _Section 7.14_, then the Sellers,
directly or indirectly through their Representatives, may furnish to such
Potential Buyer or its Representatives non-public information relating to the
Sellers, PMAC and the CMG Companies pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Sellers shall contemporaneously make
available to the Purchaser any material non-public information relating to the
Sellers, PMAC and the CMG Companies that is made available to such Potential
Buyer, which was not previously made available to the Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to taking any action described above in this _Section
7.14(b)_, (i) the Receiver and the CUNA Mutual board of directors (the " _CUNA
Board_ ") shall each determine in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely
to violate their respective fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) in the
event the Potential Buyer is a Previous Bidder, each of the Receiver and the
CUNA Board shall also determine in good faith, based on the information then
available and after consultation with their financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (iii) Sellers shall have notified Purchaser of their intention to take
such action. The Sellers shall provide any commercially sensitive non-public
information to such Potential Buyer in connection with the actions
contemplated by this _Section 7.14(b)_ in a manner consistent with the
SellersÂ’ past practice in dealing with the disclosure of such information
during the process leading to this Agreement. The Sellers shall require any
Person submitting an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to provide a copy of
this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement (together, the " _Purchase
Agreements_ ") marked to show any proposed changes to the terms of the
Purchase Agreements that such Person would require to be included in the
definitive agreements under which such proposal is to be consummated.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Following the execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, the
Sellers shall not engage in any discussions or negotiations, or execute an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, with a Potential Buyer if a Superior
Proposal is received after the earlier of (i) the date that is three (3) weeks
from the date such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement is fully executed and
(ii) the date that is one (1) week prior to PMIÂ’s hearing with the Court to
seek approval of the Transaction.

 



 

(d) In the event (i) each of the Receiver and the CUNA Board determine in good
faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that an Acquisition
Proposal from a Potential Buyer, whether or not a Previous Bidder, constitutes
a Superior Proposal and (ii) each of the Receiver and the CUNA Board determine
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, the Sellers, directly or
indirectly through their Representatives, may enter into or participate in
discussions or negotiations with such Potential Buyer and its Representatives
and may enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with such Potential
Buyer, subject to compliance with _Section 7.14(f)_.

 



 

(e) The Sellers shall notify the Purchaser orally and in writing promptly
(and, in any event, within 48 hours) after any Seller Representative
Individual (i) receives any Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal that
would be an Acquisition Proposal but for the SellersÂ’ determination that such
offer or proposal does not constitute a bona fide economic proposal, (ii)
receives any request for discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry that specifically references or unambiguously implies the reasonable
prospect of an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) provides a confidentiality
agreement or non-disclosure agreement, or any non-public information relating
to the Assets to a Potential Buyer, which notice shall identify the Person or
Potential Buyer making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the
nature of such inquiry or request, or, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements). The Sellers shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed
on a prompt basis of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments thereto and any
change in the SellersÂ’ intentions as previously notified) and shall provide
copies of all correspondence and other written materials sent or provided to
such Seller Representative Individual relating to any such material
developments, discussions or negotiations. For purposes of this _Section
7.14(e)_, a Seller Representative Individual shall not be deemed to have
received any such offer, proposal, request or inquiry, unless such offer,
proposal, request or inquiry was specifically directed to such Seller
Representative Individual or such Seller Representative Individual otherwise
receives, or gains actual knowledge of, such offer, proposal, request or
inquiry, in which case, such Seller Representative Individual shall be deemed
to have received such offer, proposal, request or inquiry at the time such
Seller Representative Individual receives, or gains actual knowledge of, such
offer, proposal, request or inquiry.

 



 

(f) The Sellers shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(d)_ to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, unless (i) each of the Receiver and the CUNA Board
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal

 



      
 

 



 

constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) each of the Receiver and the CUNA Board
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, (iii) the Sellers
shall have complied with their obligations under this _Section 7.14_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal and (iv) the Sellers promptly notify the
Purchaser in writing, at least five (5) Business Days before taking such
action (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the SellersÂ’ determination that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and of their intention to
take such action. The requirements of _Section 7.14(d)_ shall apply during
the pendency of the Notice Period. During the Notice Period, Sellers shall,
and shall cause their Representatives to, negotiate with Purchaser in good
faith to make such adjustments to the terms of this Agreement and/or the Asset
Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (within the meaning
hereof and within the meaning of the Asset Purchase Agreement) as may make
such Acquisition Proposal cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, if
Purchaser, in its sole direction proposes any such adjustments. If, after the
commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms
of such Acquisition Proposal, including any revision in price, the Notice
Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three (3)
Business Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Sellers
notify the Purchaser of any such material revision (it being agreed that,
subject to the remaining provisions hereof, multiple extensions are possible).
If the Purchaser proposes any adjustment to the terms of this Agreement and/or
the Asset Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (within the
meaning hereof and within the meaning of the Asset Purchase Agreement) (a "
_Revised Proposal_ "), the Sellers shall not be permitted to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
unless, after taking into account such Revised Proposal, (x) each of the
Receiver and the CUNA Board have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, (y) each of the Receiver
and the CUNA Board have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law
and (z) the Sellers shall have complied with its obligations under this
_Section 7.14_ during the Notice Period (as extended, if applicable).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Notice Period has been
extended at least twice and the Purchaser submits one or more Revised
Proposals during the Notice Period, as so extended, that result in such
Acquisition Proposal ceasing to constitute a Superior Proposal and the
Potential Buyer makes a further revision to such Acquisition Proposal that
results in such Acquisition Proposal constituting a Superior Proposal, as
determined by the Sellers in accordance with the foregoing clauses (x) and
(y), then (1) the Notice Period shall be extended for an additional period of
not less than five (5) Business Days following the SellersÂ’ notice to the
Purchaser of such further revised Acquisition Proposal, (2) each of the
Purchaser and such Potential Buyer shall be given the opportunity to submit,
prior to the end of such extended Notice Period, a "best and final" proposal,
incorporating any modifications to the PurchaserÂ’s most recent proposal and
such Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, that the Purchaser or such Potential
Buyer elects to make in its sole discretion and (3) the Sellers shall select
between such "best and final" proposals, it being understood that Sellers
shall not enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Potential
BuyerÂ’s revised Acquisition Proposal unless the requirements of the foregoing
clauses (x) through (z) have been satisfied in respect thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Each Seller agrees that in the event any of its Representatives takes any
action which, if taken by such Seller, would constitute a breach of this
_Section 7.14_, then such Seller shall be deemed to be in breach of this
_Section 7.14_.

determining whether a proposal or offer is a bona fide proposal or offer, the
Sellers shall take into consideration, among other items, (i) the financial
capabilities of such unaffiliated third party and the terms and likelihood of
receipt of any required third party financing, (ii) the likelihood of the
consummation of the transactions to be consummated in connection with such
proposal or offer, including the conditions contemplated by such proposal or
offer, the additional due diligence required by such third party, if any, and

or the CMG Companies in connection with such Potential BuyerÂ’s consideration
of a proposal for PMI, any or all of PMIÂ’s assets or any or all of the CMG

(v) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal received from a Potential Buyer that (A) the Receiver
concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view
than the Transaction and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents and the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Transaction Documents
defined therein, considered in their entirety, including the Break-Up Fee
contemplated herein and in the Asset Purchase Agreement that would be payable
if such Superior Proposal were pursued, and (B) the CUNA Board concludes in

Transaction and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,

party consents (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of
outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal and the conditions to any required third party financing), regulatory
and other aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted
under applicable Law, (iv) after considering the ability of the Potential

7.15 _Termination of the Surplus Notes_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall cause the Surplus Notes to be exchanged for equity in the form
of paid in capital.

 



 

7.16 _Purchaser Acknowledgments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, neither Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates makes
any representation or warranty with respect to, and nothing contained in this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any other agreement, document or
instrument to be delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby is intended or shall be construed to be a representation or
warranty (express or implied) of either Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates, for any purpose of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or
any other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, with respect to: (i) the
adequacy or sufficiency of any of the Insurance Reserves with respect to the
CMG Business, (ii) other than as set forth in _Section 5.16_, whether or not
such Insurance Reserves were determined in accordance with any actuarial,
statutory or other standard, (iii) the future profitability of the CMG

Reserves on any "line item" or asset, liability or equity amount. Furthermore,
each of the Purchaser Parties acknowledges and agrees that no fact, condition,
development or issue relating to the adequacy or sufficiency of the Insurance
Reserves may be used, directly or indirectly, to demonstrate or support the
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, the Transaction Document or any other agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

document or instrument to be delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

7.17 _Management of the Business During the Earnout Period_.

 



 

(a) From the Closing Date until the earlier of (a) the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Closing Date, or, if applicable, until the final day of any extension
effected in accordance with _Section 2.7(e)_), and (b) any earlier
anniversary of the Closing Date in respect of which the final Deferred
Consideration Payment is payable (such period, the " _Purchaser Covenant
Period_ "), Purchaser shall (i) act in good faith and not take any action
which Purchaser intends, and the primary purpose of which is, to reduce the
Deferred Consideration Payments hereunder and (ii) unless otherwise required
by Applicable Law, GAAP or SAP, or otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Sellers, utilize the same premium collection and recognition practices with
respect to the Pre-Closing Portfolio as Purchaser and its Affiliates use in
respect of their mortgage insurance businesses generally. The Parties agree
and acknowledge that, except as set forth in the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 7.17(a)_, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be free to conduct
their businesses, including the CMG Businesses and the Pre-Closing Portfolio
in any manner they see fit and in their sole and absolute discretion and the
Sellers hereby expressly deny any implied covenant at law or in equity that
may impose any obligation on the Purchaser or its Affiliates that is
inconsistent with the foregoing. In addition, in the event that any CMG
Company settles any loss relating to the Pre-Closing Portfolio that is
tendered but not covered by a policy comprising the Pre-Closing Portfolio (an
" _Ex Gratia Payment_ "), the amount of such Ex Gratia Payment shall not be
deducted for purposes of calculating the Deferred Compensation Payment for the
period during which such settlement was paid. Anything to the contrary
notwithstanding, Ex Gratia Payments will not include settlements of losses
that are reasonably determined by the Purchaser to be within the terms of
coverage under a policy comprising the Pre-Closing Portfolio, nor settlements
made to avoid costs that could be incurred in connection with potential or
actual litigation relating to coverage issues arising under the policies
comprising the Pre-Closing Portfolio.

 



 

(b) In the event that, during the Purchaser Covenant Period, the Purchaser,
other than through reinsurance, sells, or otherwise transfers the Pre-Closing
Portfolio (whether directly or by merger, consolidation, exchange or sale (of
all or a substantial portion) of assets or equity or otherwise), then the
Purchaser shall (i) cause the Person acquiring the Pre-Closing Portfolio to
assume the PurchaserÂ’s obligations hereunder that relate specifically to the
Pre-Closing Portfolio (including under _Section 2.7_ and this _Section 7.17_
hereof) and (ii) if such acquiring Person is not an Affiliate of the Purchaser
Parent cause a Qualifying Guarantor to guaranty such acquiring PersonÂ’s
assumed obligations under _Section 2.7_ in a manner consistent with _Article
XIII_ hereof and, in the case of a transfer to a non-Affiliate of the
Purchaser Parent and if so requested by the Sellers, take one of the actions
set forth in _Section 13.2(b)(iii) or (iv)_. Solely upon the PurchaserÂ’s
compliance with its obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the
Purchaser shall automatically cease to have any obligation under or in respect
of _Section 2.7_ or this _Section 7.17_. In the case of a transfer to a non-
Affiliate of the Purchaser Parent, solely upon the PurchaserÂ’s compliance with
its obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Purchaser Parent
shall automatically cease to have any obligation under or in respect of
_Section 2.7_ hereof or this _Section 7.17_, by virtue of _Section 13.1_ or
otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Purchaser agrees that, during the Purchaser Covenant Period, the
Purchaser shall (i) maintain such books of record and account of CMG MIÂ’s
dealings and transactions in relation to the Pre-Closing Portfolio as are
reasonably necessary to verify PurchaserÂ’s calculations of Adjusted Book Value
pursuant to this Agreement and within ninety (90) days following each March 31
and September 30 following the delivery of the Closing Statement pursuant to
_Section 2.6_, deliver to the Sellers (A) a calculation in reasonable detail
of the Adjusted Book Value as of the last day of the prior calendar quarter,
as well as each component of the Adjusted Book Value, as contemplated by the
definition thereof, with such supporting details of the calculation as may be
reasonably requested by the Sellers and (B) documentation relating to the
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of the CMG Companies during
such period, if applicable.

 



 

7.18 _Notice of Seller Capital Contributions_. From the date hereof until the
Closing, in the event that either Seller determines that the aggregate amount
of the Seller Capital Contributions will exceed $10,000,000, such Seller
agrees to promptly provide the Purchaser with written notice of such
determination and each Seller Capital Contribution such Seller makes to a CMG
Company. Following any such notice, if requested by Purchaser, the Sellers
shall promptly meet with the Purchaser to discuss the anticipated capital
requirements of the CMG Companies.

 



 

7.19 _Consultation_. The Sellers agree to consult with the Purchaser in

(b) Upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section

Purchaser Indemnified Parties, agree (A) not to seek indemnification for the
portion of any Covered Losses arising pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_ or
_Section 12.2(b)_, _Section 12.3(a)_ or _Section 12.3(b)_ or _Section
12.4(a),_ _Section 12.4(b) or Section 12.4(c)_, that exceeds the SellersÂ’
Indemnification Cap for any and all such Covered Losses sustained or incurred
by any and all Purchaser Indemnified Parties, (B) that all claims for such
Covered Losses are payable solely from the Indemnification Escrow Fund and (C)
that, after the exhaustion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, all claims
against either Seller with respect to such Covered Losses shall be
extinguished and shall not thereafter revive and no Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall have any further claim thereafter against either Seller for any
shortfall;

 



 

(d) notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree (i) that any claims
related to any breach of the covenants and agreements set forth in _Article
VIII_ (Court Matters) must be brought directly against PMI and may not be
brought against CUNA Mutual, shall not be payable from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund, and shall not count towards the SellersÂ’ Indemnification Cap and
(ii) that any claims related to any breach of the covenants and agreements set
forth in Section 7.8 (Tax Matters) must be brought directly against PMI and
may not be brought against CUNA Mutual, and shall be payable from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 12.6(e);

 



      
 

 



 

(e) with respect to claims related to any breach of or inaccuracy in (i) the
PMI Fundamental Representations, (ii) the CUNA Mutual Fundamental
Representations, (iii) the CMG Fundamental Representations, (iv) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.10_ (Tax Matters) and
(v) the covenants and agreements set forth in _Section 7.8_ (Tax Matters),
the Purchaser Parties, on behalf of themselves, their Affiliates and all
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, agree to first seek indemnification for such
Covered Losses from the Indemnification Escrow Fund and following exhaustion
of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, directly from the applicable Seller or,
if applicable, the Sellers;

 



 

(f) in the event that any fact, event or circumstance results in payment to
the Purchaser of any amount in connection with the adjustment of the Closing
Date Payment pursuant to _Section 2.6_, and such fact, event or circumstance
would also constitute a breach of or inaccuracy in any of either SellerÂ’s
representations or warranties under this Agreement, Sellers shall have no
obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to such
breach or inaccuracy to the extent such amount is paid pursuant to _Section
2.6_;

 



 

(g) notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Covered Losses arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation based on the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_, _Article IV_ and
_Article V_ or willful and malicious breaches of this Agreement by a Seller
shall not be subject to this _Section 12.6_ or any other limitation set forth
in this Agreement; and

 



 

(h) in determining whether a representation or warranty has been breached for
purposes of the SellersÂ’ obligations to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under _Section 12.2(a)_, _12.3(a)_ and _12.4(a)_ and determining
the amount of any Covered Losses, "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect" and
other similar materiality qualifiers contained in any such representation or
warranty shall be disregarded; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply to the following sections: _Section 5.7_ (Financial
Statements), _Section 5.16_ (Reserves) and _Section 5.27(a)_ (No Material
Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _further_ , that the lack of materiality shall
not impact the use of dollar thresholds in any representation herein nor shall
the lack of materiality impact the definition or use of the phrase "Material
Contract" in _Section 5.9_ or any other representation herein. The right to
indemnification, payment of Covered Losses or any other remedy based on the
breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Purchaser Indemnified Party may
not seek indemnification with respect to matters set forth on the PMI
Disclosure Schedule, the CUNA Mutual Disclosure Schedule or the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the express waiver of any
condition based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty set forth
in _Section 9.2_ or the performance of or compliance with any covenant will
not affect the right of Purchaser Indemnified Parties to indemnification,
payment of Covered Losses or other remedy based upon such waiver.

 



 

12.7 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations of the Purchaser_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) the Purchaser shall not be liable under _Section 12.5(a)_ until the
aggregate amount of Covered Losses under _Section 12.5(a)_ for which notice
was timely received in accordance with _Section 12.1_ exceeds the Basket
Amount, at which time the Purchaser shall be liable for all such Covered
Losses (including all Covered Losses included within such Basket Amount) in
accordance with the provisions hereof, except that claims related to any
breach of or inaccuracy in the Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall not
be subject to any such limits;

 



 

(b) the Purchaser shall not be liable under _Section 12.5(a)_ for any Covered
Loss (including any series of related Covered Losses) unless such Covered Loss
(including any series of related Covered Losses) equals or exceeds the De
Minimis Threshold, nor shall any Covered Loss that does not meet the De
Minimis Threshold be considered in determining whether the Basket Amount has
been met; _provided_ , _however_ , that claims related to any breach of or
inaccuracy in the Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall not be subject
to the De Minimis Threshold;

 



 

(c) subject to the terms hereof, other than with respect to claims related to
any breach of or inaccuracy in the Purchaser Fundamental Representations, the
aggregate liability of the Purchaser for Covered Losses arising pursuant to
_Section 12.5(a)_ and _Section 12.5(b)_ is, and shall be, limited to an
aggregate amount equal to twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) (the "
_Purchaser Â’s Liability Amount_") and the Sellers, on behalf of themselves,
their respective Affiliates and all Seller Indemnified Parties, agree not to
seek indemnification for any Covered Losses arising pursuant to _Section
12.5(a)_ and _Section 12.5(b)_ in excess of the PurchaserÂ’s Liability Amount;

 



 

(d) notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Covered Losses arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation based on the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article VI_ or willful and
malicious breaches of this Agreement by the Purchaser shall not be subject to
this _Section 12.7_ or any other limitation set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

(e) in determining whether a representation or warranty has been breached for
purposes of the PurchaserÂ’s obligations to indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Parties under _Section 12.5(a)_ and determining the amount of any Covered
Losses, "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect" and other similar materiality
qualifiers contained in any such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded. The right to indemnification, payment of Covered Losses or any
other remedy based on the breach of any representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Seller
Indemnified Party may not seek indemnification with respect to matters set
forth on the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the express waiver of any condition based upon
the accuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section 9.3_ or
the performance of or compliance with any covenant will not affect the right
of Seller Indemnified Parties to indemnification, payment of Covered Losses or
other remedy based upon such waiver.

 



 

12.8 _Notice of Non-Third Party Claims_. As promptly as is reasonably
practicable after becoming aware of a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement that does not involve

 



      
 

 



 

a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall give written notice to the
indemnifying party of such claim, which notice shall specify the provision of
this Agreement pursuant to which indemnity is sought, the facts alleged to
constitute the basis for such claim (taking into account the information then
available to the indemnified party), the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements alleged to have been breached (if applicable) and the
amount (if then determinable) that the indemnified party seeks hereunder from
the indemnifying party. Subject to _Section 12.1_, the failure of an
indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party will not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that the
indemnifying partyÂ’s defense or other rights available to it is actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure, and then only to the extent of such
prejudice.

 



 

12.9 _Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense_.

 



 

(a) If a claim or Action by a Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate
thereof (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made or brought against any Seller
Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification under this _Article
XII_ with respect to such claim or Action, such Indemnified Party shall give
notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in no event later than
ten (10) Business Days, after receiving notice thereof, to the Party obligated
to provide such indemnification under this _Article XII_ (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ "). Such notice shall specify the provision of this Agreement pursuant
to which indemnity is sought, the facts alleged to constitute the basis for
such claim, the identity of the Persons bringing such claim or Action, the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements or provision of Law or
Contract alleged to have been breached, as applicable, and the amount (or, to
the extent not then determinable, the Indemnified PartyÂ’s good faith estimate
thereof) that the Indemnified Party intends to seek from the Indemnifying
Party hereunder. Subject to _Section 12.1_, the failure to promptly give such
notification will not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s defense or other rights available to it is
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure, and then only to the extent
of such prejudice.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the sole power, at its option, to assume
the conduct and control of the settlement or defense of any Third Party Claim
for which indemnification may be sought, at its own expense through counsel of
its own choosing (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party), by giving written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party must notify the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume such conduct and control within thirty (30) days
following the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s receipt of notice of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall thereafter
consult with the Indemnified Party upon the Indemnified PartyÂ’s reasonable
request for such consultation from time to time with respect to such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the conduct and control of such
settlement or defense, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in connection therewith, and the Indemnified Party shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to participate in (but not control)
such settlement or defense and to employ counsel, at its own cost and expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded
joint representation presents a material conflict of interest because of the
availability of different or additional defenses to such Indemnified Party or
other facts and the conflict of interest cannot be resolved to the reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

satisfaction of the Indemnified Party by the consent of the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party to the joint representation, then such Indemnified
Party shall have the right to select separate counsel, reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnifying Party, to participate in the defense of such action on its
behalf, and the reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s
counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The assumption of
the conduct and control of such settlement or defense shall not be deemed to
be an admission or assumption of liability by the Indemnifying Party. So long
as the Indemnifying Party is using its commercially reasonable efforts to
contest any such Third Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall
not pay or settle any such claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume the conduct and control of the settlement or defense of such Third
Party Claim, then, subject to _Section 12.9(c)_ below, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to pay or settle such claim.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, whether or not
the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the conduct or control of the
defense or settlement of a Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit
any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party the time period
contemplated by _Section 12.9(a)_ that it elects to assume the conduct or
control of the defense or settlement thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim and shall not thereby
waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Party
who assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to _Section
12.9(b)_, _Section 12.9(c)_ or _Section 12.9(d)_ is referred to herein as
the " _Controlling Party_ " and the other party with respect to any such Third
Party Claim is referred to herein as the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ".

 



 

(d) If a Third Party Claim is a criminal claim (a " _Criminal Third Party
Claim_ "), the subject of such Criminal Third Party Claim may elect to assume
the defense of such claim. If a Seller Indemnified Party and a Purchaser
Indemnified Party are each subjects of such Criminal Third Party Claim, each
such Party may elect to defend the claims against it, no Party shall be deemed
to be the Controlling Party and no Party shall have the right to make any
settlement, compromise or offer to settle or compromise such Criminal Third
Party Claim as it relates to the other Party.

 



 

(e) Other than with respect to Criminal Third Party Claims, any Non-
Controlling Party may become the Controlling Party with respect to any Third
Party Claim either (i) if the other Party fails to assume the conduct and
control of the defense of such Third Party within the time period contemplated
by _Section 12.9(b)_ or fails to conduct such defense in a commercially
reasonable manner, which failure remains uncured ten (10) Business Days
following notice by the Non-Controlling Party thereof, or (ii) by releasing
the initial Controlling Party from any and all indemnification obligations
under this _Article XII_ with respect to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if a Third Party Claim alleges wrongdoing by the Controlling
Party or its Affiliates or involves other reputational matters relating to the
Controlling Party or its Affiliates, the Non-Controlling Party may only become
the Controlling Party with the consent of the initial Controlling Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of
any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder
and each Party (or a duly authorized representative of such Party) shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to) furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

12.10 _Settlement or Compromise_. The Controlling Party with respect to any
Third Party Claim shall have the right to make any settlement, compromise,
judgment or offer to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim with the
prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), binding upon such Non-Controlling Party in the same
manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such written consent of the Non-Controlling
Party shall not be required in the event (i) such settlement, compromise,
judgment or offer to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim does not (A)
involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing by the Non-Controlling Party or (B) materially encumber any of the
assets of any Non-Controlling Party or adversely affect in any material
respect the post-Closing operation of the business of the Non-Controlling
Party or its Affiliates in any manner, and (ii) the Controlling Party shall
(A) pay or cause to be paid all amounts required to be paid by it under this
_Article XII _arising out of such settlement or judgment upon the
effectiveness of such settlement or judgment, and (B) obtain, as a condition
of any settlement, compromise, judgment or offer to settle or compromise, or
other resolution, an appropriate release of each Non-Controlling Party from
any and all corresponding liabilities in respect of such Third Party Claim or
the applicable portion thereof.

 



 

12.11 _Distribution of the Escrow Amount_

 



 

(a) The Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent, including by providing jointly
written instructions to the Escrow Agent, to distribute the amounts remaining
in the Indemnification Escrow Fund from time to time in accordance with the
following, subject to _Section 12.11(b)_ and the terms of the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement: (i) in the event of an indemnification claim by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party that is uncontested and due and payable, or has been ordered
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be paid, to the Purchaser Indemnified
Party pursuant to this _Article XII_, an amount required to satisfy such
claim (or the balance contained in the Indemnification Escrow Fund (if less))
shall be released to such Purchaser Indemnified Party; (ii) fifty percent
(50%) of such amounts remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund as of the
date that is the later of (i) the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date
and (ii) three (3) months following the date on which the Purchaser
Indemnified Party receives a final report of the independent auditors of the
CMG Companies in respect of the first audit of the CMG Companies completed
following the Closing Date shall be released to the Sellers pro rata based
upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof; and (iii) all
amounts remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund as of the date that is
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date shall be released to the
Sellers pro rata based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount to be released to the Sellers
pursuant to each of clause (ii) and (iii) shall be reduced by an amount that
would be necessary, as determined by the Purchaser Indemnified PartiesÂ’ claim
notices or as otherwise reasonably agreed by the Parties in good faith, to
satisfy any and all then pending and unsatisfied

 



      
 

 



 

or unresolved claims specified in any notice of claim delivered to the Escrow
Agent prior to such time (such amounts, in the aggregate, the " _Retained
Escrow Amount_ ").

 



 

(b) In any event, the Retained Escrow Amount shall be retained in the
Indemnification Escrow Fund until the claims related thereto have been fully
resolved and are no longer subject to appeal. As soon as all such claims have
been resolved and related amounts, if any, paid out of the Retained Escrow
Amount, the Escrow Agent shall as soon as practicable distribute any remaining
Retained Escrow Amount not required to satisfy such claims to the Sellers pro
rata based upon each SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest as of the date hereof.

 



 

12.12 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_

 



 

(a) Any Liability for indemnification hereunder and under any other
Transaction Document shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the same Loss.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, other than in the case of fraud by the Sellers, the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Parties for any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder shall be the refusal to
close the transactions contemplated hereunder in accordance with _Section
9.2(a)_ and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
XI_.

 



 

(c) Subject to the final sentence of this _Section 12.12(c)_, except in the
case of fraud or where a Party seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant
to _Section 14.7_, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Sellers, the Seller Indemnified Parties, the Purchaser Parties and the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether under this Agreement or arising
under common law or any other Law, shall be as provided in this _Article XII_
and, as applicable, _Section 2.5_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of
the Purchaser, on behalf of itself, the Purchaser Parent, on behalf of itself,
and each other Purchaser Indemnified Party, and the Sellers, on behalf of
themselves and each other Seller Indemnified Party, hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, fraud) it may have against the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives and the Purchaser, the Purchaser
Parent or any of their Affiliates or Representatives, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon this Agreement or any certificate delivered in
connection herewith, whether under this contract or arising under common law
or any other Law except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this _Article XII_ and the set-off right contemplated in _Section 2.5_.
Nothing in this _Section 12.12_ shall operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the provisions of any Transaction Document or the rights of
either Party to seek equitable remedies to enforce any covenant of a Party to
be performed after the Closing.

 



 

12.13 _Net Losses; Subrogation; Mitigation; No Set Off_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
any Covered Losses incurred or suffered by an Indemnified Party shall be
calculated after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds received by the
Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates)

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to such Losses, (ii) any recoveries actually obtained by the
Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) from any other third party in
respect of such Covered Loss and (iii) any Tax benefits actually received with
respect to such Covered Losses in the year such Covered Losses arose. If any
such proceeds or recoveries are received by an Indemnified Party (or any of
its Affiliates) with respect to any Covered Losses after an Indemnifying Party
has made a payment to the Indemnified Party with respect thereto, the
Indemnified Party (or such Affiliate) shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such proceeds or recoveries (up to the amount of the Indemnifying
PartyÂ’s payment). No Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover from an
Indemnifying Party more than once in respect of the same Covered Losses.

 



 

(b) In the event any payment is made in respect of Covered Losses, the
Indemnifying Party who made such payment will be subrogated to the extent of
such payment to any related rights of recovery of the Indemnified Party
receiving such payment against any third party. Such Indemnified Party (and
its Affiliates) and Indemnifying Party shall execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such
subrogation rights. If any Indemnified Party recovers, under insurance
policies or from other collateral sources, any amount in respect of a matter
for which the Indemnifying Party made a payment pursuant to _Section 12.2_,
_Section 12.3_, _Section 12.4_, or _Section 12.5_ as applicable, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount
so recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount of the expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the
sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount
expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter.

 



 

(c) Neither the Purchaser Parties nor the Seller shall have any right to set
off any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article XII_ against any
payment due pursuant to _Article II_ or, except as set forth in _Section
2.5_, any Transaction Document. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2,_ _Section 12.3_, or
_Section 12.4 _for any Covered Loss to the extent that such Covered Loss, or
the facts or basis underlying such Covered Loss, was specifically and
expressly contemplated in the calculation of the Closing Date Book Value or
the Adjusted Book Value.

 



 

(d) To the extent reasonably requested by the Sellers jointly and in writing,
the Purchaser shall cause the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Covered Losses for which any
Purchaser Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to this Agreement,
which mitigation may include pursuing recoveries against third parties or
insurance proceeds, in each case, to the extent commercially reasonable and
reasonably requested by the Sellers. The Sellers shall reimburse the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for all costs and expenses incurred by any of them in
complying with this _Section 12.13(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Purchaser may not seek reimbursement for any increased insurance premiums
unless the Purchaser previously disclosed to the Sellers the potential and the
reasonably anticipated magnitude of such increase prior to taking the
requested mitigation. Upon receipt of such notification, the Sellers may
rescind their mitigation request. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in
no event shall any breach or purported breach by Purchaser of this _Section
12.13(d)_ obviate, reduce or limit SellersÂ’ obligation to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Covered Loss
incurred by

 



      
 

 



 

any Purchaser Indemnified Party, subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. Rather, SellersÂ’ sole recourse for any
breach by Purchaser of this _Section 12.13(d)_ shall be to assert a claim for
indemnification in accordance with this Agreement for any Covered Losses
suffered by Sellers as a result thereof.

 



 

12.14 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. For Tax purposes, any payment
pursuant to this _Article XII_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII**

 



 

 **PURCHASER PARENT GUARANTY**

 



 

13.1 _Guaranty_. The Purchaser Parent hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
(except as set forth in this Agreement) unconditionally guarantees to the
Sellers, the due and punctual payment and performance of each of the
PurchaserÂ’s obligations and any obligations of its successors or permitted
assigns under this Agreement, including without limitation the payment of all
amounts due from the Purchaser under _Article XII_ of this Agreement, as and
when due and payable, and the Purchaser Parent shall immediately pay and
perform all such obligations upon written demand made at any time by the
Sellers from and after the date such amounts are due and payable by the
Purchaser but remain unpaid. The foregoing obligation of the Purchaser Parent
constitutes a continuing guaranty of payment and not of collection and is and
shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances except as
set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation circumstances which
might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or
guarantor. Except as set forth in this Agreement, the obligation of the
Purchaser Parent hereunder shall not be discharged, impaired, delayed or
otherwise affected by the failure of the Sellers to assert any claim or demand
against the Purchaser Parent or to enforce or pursue any remedy hereunder. The
Purchaser Parent agrees that its guarantee under this _Section 13.1_ shall
continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time
any payment, or any part thereof, of any amounts by or on behalf of the
Purchaser under this Agreement is rescinded or must otherwise be restored upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Purchaser or otherwise.
The Purchaser Parent agrees to pay all expenses of the Sellers (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of their respective counsel) for the enforcement
of the rights of the Sellers against the Purchaser Parent under this _Section
13.1_, except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines
such enforcement to have been invalid.

 



 

13.2 _Limitation on Guarantor Transactions_.

 



 

(a) In the event that at any time from the Closing Date through and including
the Final Settlement Date, the Purchaser Parent: (i) consolidates with or
amalgamates, combines or merges into any other Person and, immediately
thereafter (A) is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation, amalgamation, combination or merger and (B) is not a
Qualifying Guarantor; or (ii) sells or transfers to a third party a portion of
its assets (including investment assets) and the assets of its Subsidiaries,
that represent seventy-five percent (75%) of more of the aggregate value of
its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ assets, on a consolidated basis (whether in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, including through the sale of

 



      
 

 



 

one or more Subsidiaries) to one or more Persons, the Purchaser must provide
the Sellers written notice of such event.

 



 

(b) Following receipt of the notice described in _Section 13.2(a)_, if the
transaction described in _Section 13.2(a)_ does not constitute a Change of
Control with respect to Purchaser Parent, the Purchaser shall be required to
take one or more of the following actions; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the
selection of such action shall be made by the Purchaser, at its sole option
and in its sole discretion after prior written notice to and consultation with
the Sellers:

 



 

(i) cause such surviving or acquiring Person(s) to cause a Qualifying
Guarantor (which for the avoidance of doubt may include such Person if it is a
Qualifying Guarantor) to assume, pursuant to a written instrument entered into
for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Sellers the obligations of
Purchaser Parent set forth in this _Article XIII_, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein;

 



 

(ii) cause an Affiliate of the Purchaser Parent with a senior debt or issuer
credit rating by any rating agency that assigned a rating to the Purchaser
Parent as of the Closing Date that is at least equal to the senior debt or
issuer credit rating assigned to the Purchaser Parent by such rating agency as
of the Closing Date to assume, by a written instrument entered into for the
benefit of, and enforceable by, the Sellers the obligations of the Purchaser
Parent set forth in this _Article XIII_, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein;

 



 

(iii) establish and maintain an interest-bearing escrow account with a United
States bank or trust company for the benefit of the Sellers to secure
performance by the Purchaser Parent of its obligations under this _Article
XIII_ and deposit into such account an amount equal to the Maximum Remaining
Deferred Consideration Amount. Such escrow account shall be held pursuant to
an escrow agreement in customary form between Purchaser Parent, Sellers and
the escrow agent and shall terminate on the Final Settlement Date, at which
time any funds remaining therein shall be released to the Purchaser Parent.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, such escrow
account described in this clause (c) shall be the sole and exclusive recourse

but such escrow account shall not be deemed to be the sole and exclusive
remedy of any Seller Indemnified Party for any other obligation of Purchaser
guaranteed by Purchaser Parent pursuant to this _Article XIII_; or

Purchaser may replace such letter(s) of credit with one or more comparable
letter(s) of credit issued by the same or different United States bank(s) in
an aggregate amount equal to the Maximum Remaining Deferred Consideration
Amount, as reduced from time to time. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, letter(s) of credit described in this clause (c)
shall be the sole and exclusive

 



      
 

 



 

recourse of Sellers for the payment of any remaining Deferred Consideration
Payments, but such letter(s) of credit shall not be deemed to be the sole and
exclusive remedy of any Seller Indemnified Party for any other obligation of
Purchaser guaranteed by Purchaser Parent pursuant to this _Article XIII_.

 



 

(c) Following receipt of the notice described in _Section 13.2(a)_, if the
transaction described in _Section 13.2(a)_ does constitute a Change of
Control with respect to Purchaser Parent, (i) the Purchaser shall be required
to take one of the actions described in _Sections 13.2(b)(i)_ or
_13.2(b)(ii)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the selection of such action
shall be made by the Purchaser at its sole option and in its sole discretion
after prior written notice to and consultation with the Sellers, and (ii) to
the extent requested by the Sellers jointly in writing, the Purchaser shall be
required to take one of the actions described in _Sections 13.2(b)(iii)_ or
_13.2(b)(iv)_ : _provided_ , _however_ , that the selection of such action
shall be made by the Purchaser at its sole option and in its sole discretion
after prior written notice to and consultation with the Sellers.

sections of such Disclosure Schedule to the extent that such disclosure sets
forth facts in sufficient detail so that the relevance of such disclosure
would be reasonably apparent to a reader of such disclosure. Matters reflected
in any section of a Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set

other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement.
