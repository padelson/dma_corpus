ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK_

 

 _OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ ") (other than (i) Shares owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent and Shares owned by the Company, including Shares held in treasury
by the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties
(collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") and (ii) the Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $136.50 in cash,
without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective
Time, each of the Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be automatically cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting
Shares) and each non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (other than
Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. Each Cancelled Share shall cease
to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be automatically converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and together shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Company Equity and Cash Incentive Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Each option to purchase Shares issued under a
Company Omnibus Incentive Plan (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") and that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares underlying such Company Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (B) the per-share exercise
price of such Company Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment (the " _Company Stock Option
Consideration_ "); _provided_ that if the exercise price per Share of any
such 

 



3

    

 Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any cash
payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof. The Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation (or the relevant employer
subsidiary) to each holder of a Company Stock Option the Company Stock Option
Consideration (if any) within ten (10) Business Days following the Effective
Time.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Each restricted stock unit granted
pursuant to a Company Omnibus Incentive Plan that vests solely on the basis
of time that is not a Company Deferred Stock Unit (a " _Company Restricted
Stock Unit_ ") and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the total number of Shares underlying such Company Restricted Stock Units
and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payment (the " _Company RSU Consideration_
"). The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation (or the
relevant employer subsidiary) to each holder of a Company Restricted Stock
Unit the Company RSU Consideration within ten (10) Business Days following the
Effective Time.

 

(c) _Company Performance Stock Units_. Each performance stock unit granted
pursuant to a Company Omnibus Incentive Plan that vests on the basis of time
and the achievement of performance targets (a " _Company Performance Stock

Units other than those with a performance period ending on December 31, 2019,
equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares underlying such Company

pursuant to a Company Omnibus Incentive Plan to a non-employee director of

product of (x) the total number of Shares underlying such Company Deferred
Stock Units and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (the " _Company DSU
Consideration_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each holder of a Company Deferred Stock

(e) _Company Cash Incentive Awards_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each cash
incentive award (including annual incentive plan and long-term incentive plan
awards) granted pursuant to a Company Omnibus Incentive Plan (a " _Company
Cash Incentive Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an

Board or a committee thereof prior to the Effective Time, the actual level of
achievement of the applicable performance metrics, with such level of

payroll of the Surviving Corporation (or the relevant employer subsidiary) to
each grantee of a Company Cash Incentive Award the Company Cash Incentive
Award Consideration within ten (10) Business Days following the Effective
Time.

(f) _Section 409A_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with
respect to any Company Equity Award or Company Cash Incentive Award that
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code and that the Company determines prior to the Effective Time is not
eligible to be terminated in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such payment will be made at the earliest time

respect to Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, Company
Performance Stock Units and Company Deferred Stock Units (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") held by individuals subject to Taxes imposed by
the Laws of a country other than the United States, the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith prior to the Closing to minimize the Tax impact of the
provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. In addition, between the

necessary to avoid or reduce such adverse Tax impact, the Company may
accelerate the vesting, exercise and/or settlement, as applicable, of Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and/or Company Performance
Stock Units, and any resulting Shares shall receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ hereof; _provided_

Section 2.3 _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed, to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection
with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive payment of the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall
become entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. At the Closing and
concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds
sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying
Agent to make payments under this _Article II_ (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in trust for the benefit of the
holders of the Shares. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the
highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at
the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such
case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months.
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_, to the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments
or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all applicable
times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
this _Article II_ shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ shall not be used for any purpose
other than as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each
holder of record of Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than holders of Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A)
transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal in customary form as
agreed by the Parties, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon
delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-
Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), and with respect to Certificates (if any),
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ to the Paying Agent), such
transmittal materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Book-Entry Shares or Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in  _Section_ __ _
2.3(f)_) to the Paying Agent.

 



6

    

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (if any) (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.3(f)_) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal
materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.3(e)_) equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (A) the
number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_) by (B) the Per
Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.

 

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form or such
other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably require (it being
understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have
surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such "agents
message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_) equal to the
product obtained by  _ _multiplying__ (A) the number of Shares represented by
such Book-Entry Share by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry
Shares.

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be
issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes arising as a
result of such unregistered transfer have been paid or are not applicable.

(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_,
each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
(together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the
Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



7

    

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this _Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.3(e)_) upon due surrender of its Certificates (if any), or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates or acceptable evidence of Book-Entry Shares,
without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_, and Parent shall remain liable for (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of their
claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Certificates or Book-Entry Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this _Article II_. The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates (or upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message", in the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates
or such Book-Entry Shares.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
(including, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_, the relevant
employer subsidiary) and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be promptly
remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Equity
Awards or Company Cash Incentive Awards, as applicable, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree
that (A) the Company may obtain, and that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall withhold any amounts from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement 

 



8

    

 under Indian Tax Law if the Company delivers to Parent, a preliminary
valuation or appraisal no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing
Date, and, if requested by Parent, a final valuation or appraisal no later
than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date, in each case, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, showing that, for the purposes of
and in accordance with the Indian Tax Law, the shares or interests in the
Company do not derive, directly or indirectly, value substantially from assets
located in India (i.e., that the value of the Companys stake in WABCO India
Limited is less than 50% of the value of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole), in all instances calculated in accordance with Section 9 of
the Indian Tax Law, (B) if deemed necessary by Parent, in its reasonable
judgment, taking into consideration the preliminary valuation described in
Section 2.3(e)(A) if delivered to Parent, the Company shall apply for
necessary tax registrations in India (Permanent Account Number and Tax
Deduction and Collection Number) and (C) the Parties shall cooperate to duly
make a voluntary filing, within thirty (30) days of the date hereof (or as
otherwise extended with permission from the competent Chinese tax authority),
with the competent Chinese Tax authority to report the transaction under the
Chinese Indirect Transfer rules (Bulletin of the State Administration of
Taxation No. 7 of 2015), and shall cooperate to timely make any supplemental
filings or provide any additional information that the competent Chinese Tax
authority may request in connection with such voluntary filing.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will, issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_) equal to the product obtained by
__multiplying__ (i) the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any Shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as to which the holders thereof
have properly perfected a demand for appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn such demand
(collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)_, unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL, at which time such
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per
Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, without
interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and such Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting
Shares, and such holder thereof shall cease to have any other rights with
respect to such Shares. Each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
the Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the
Company or any of its Representatives relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal and Parent shall be entitled to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not,

 



9

    

 except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or offer to settle or
settle any such demands, except as required by applicable Law.

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. In the event that the number of Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued
and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time shall
have been changed into a different number of Shares or securities or a
different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be construed to
permit the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take
any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(the " _Applicable Date_ ") (all such forms, reports, statements, certificates
and other documents filed since the Applicable Date, and those filed or

after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof (taking into account the notes
thereto) and the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity for the periods indicated. The

individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act)
sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of
the Companys financial statements for external purposes, in each case, in
accordance with GAAP. Since the Applicable Date, the Companys chief
executive officer and chief financial officer have disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) any "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to

process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
The terms "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" have the
meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. To the
knowledge of the Company, since the Applicable Date through the date of this
Agreement, no complaints or concerns that would be material to the Company
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole have been made through the Companys
whistleblower hot line or equivalent system regarding alleged violations of
Law or improper auditing or accounting matters. Since the Applicable Date
through the date of this Agreement, no attorney representing the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, has reported information that on its face would lead a
reasonable Person to conclude

material breach of fiduciary duty or similar material violation by the
Company or any of its officers, directors, or employees to the Companys chief

than those which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

"), with only fee amounts and other customary threshold amounts redacted (
_provided_ that Parent represents and warrants that no redacted provisions of
the Financing Commitments permit the imposition of any new conditions (or the
expansion of any

 



30

    

 existing conditions) with respect to the availability of the Financing or
any reduction in the amount of the Financing), pursuant to which the lenders
thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein (the " _Financing_ ") for the
purposes of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
related fees and expenses and the refinancing of certain outstanding
indebtedness of the Company. None of the Financing Commitments has been
amended, modified or supplemented prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of this Agreement no such amendment, modification or supplement is
contemplated by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party
thereto, and as of the date of this Agreement the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect. Except for fee letters (complete copies of which have been

Financing, as of the date hereof there are no side letters or Contracts to

Parent has paid all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and as
of the date hereof the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and

Sub, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each
of the other parties thereto, in each case subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth herein, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger
Sub, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments. As of the
date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth herein, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments
applicable to it will not be satisfied. Assuming the Financing is funded in

warrant,

 



31

    

 convertible security, stock appreciation right, swap agreement or other
security, contract right or derivative position, whether or not presently
exercisable, that provides Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective
subsidiaries with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment
or mechanism at a price related to the value of the Shares or a value
determined in whole or part with reference to, or derived in whole or
part from, the value of the Shares, in any case without regard to whether (i)
such derivative conveys any voting rights in such securities to such Person,

result of, the Merger and payment of all related fees and expenses, the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person means that, as of
any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the sum of: (A) the value
of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other
liabilities", as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors; and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(ii) such Person will not have unreasonably small capital for the operation of
the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged as of such
date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such
date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they become due. For
purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to
be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due. No insolvency or similar proceedings have been, or to the knowledge of
Parents, have been threatened to be, opened over the assets of Parent. Parent
is neither illiquid ( _zahlungsunf_ _a_ _hig_ ) nor over-leveraged ( _u_
_berschuldet_ ). The execution and consummation of this Agreement is not
subject to challenge ( _Anfechtung_ ) by any third party on the basis of any
creditor protection laws.

Section 4.10 _Access to Information_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that it has conducted its own independent investigation and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, condition, and prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries and
that it and its Representatives have received access to such books, records
and facilities, equipment, Contracts and other assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries that it and its Representatives have requested for such purposes
and that it and its Representatives have had the opportunity to meet with
management of the Company to discuss the foregoing, and that it and its

 



32

    

 Representatives have not relied on any representation, warranty, or other
statement by any Person on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
other than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article
III_ of this Agreement.

Section 4.11 _Parent and Merger Sub Acknowledgements_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ or in any
certificate delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub (and
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent or its Representatives
of any documentation, projections, estimates, budgets or other information),
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (x) none of the Company, the
Company subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of the Company makes, or
has made, any representation or warranty, express or implied, relating to
itself or its business or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Parent and
Merger Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty, express or
implied, of any Person except for those set forth in this Agreement and (y)
any estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum,
presentation or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives, including any materials or
information made available to Parent and/or its Representatives in connection
with presentations by the Companys management, are not and shall not be
deemed to be or include representations or warranties. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges that it has conducted its own independent
investigation of the condition, operations and business of the Company and in
making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied
solely on the results of its own independent investigation and the terms of
this Agreement and has not relied on any materials or information made
available to Parent and/or its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company.

 

Section 4.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article IV_ , the Company
acknowledges that neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other
information provided to the Company.

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, (v) amend or grant any waiver or release

securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries ( _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company Board shall be permitted to waive any such standstill or
similar agreement, in response to an unsolicited request for such waiver
received from a counterparty to such standstill or similar agreement, solely
to permit such counterparty to submit on a confidential basis an Acquisition
Proposal to the Company Board, if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law), (vi) approve any transaction under, or any third
party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL,
and the Company shall not resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing, except
in the case of clause (vi), to the extent any such action is taken in
connection with a Change of Recommendation or termination of this Agreement
permitted pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any (x)

on behalf of the Company) shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __
_ 6.1_ by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations or other
activities with any Person (other than the Parties) in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will promptly request

any requests for information, or any requests for discussions or negotiations
with the Company or any of its Representatives, in each case with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof, which
notice shall include a summary of the material terms of, and the identity of
the Person making, such Acquisition Proposal (including, if applicable, copies
of any such written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of any material developments related to the terms, conditions
and process associated with such proposals and offers.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company
or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from:

 

(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer, in each case, to the extent legally required,
or from making any other legally required disclosure to stockholders with
regard to any Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that neither the Company nor
the Company Board may recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless expressly
permitted by _Sections 6.1(c)_ and _6.3_ ), and _provided_ , _further_ , that
if any such disclosure that is contained in a press release or SEC filing by
the Company does not reaffirm the Recommendation, such disclosure shall be
deemed to be a Change of Recommendation); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
issuance of a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to its stockholders) in which the Company indicates that the
Company Board has not changed the Recommendation shall not constitute a Change
of Recommendation;

(ii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote,
providing access to its properties, books and records and providing
information or data in response to a request therefor by a Person or group who
has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that was not
initiated, solicited, encouraged (in any material respect) or facilitated (in
any material respect) in violation of this Agreement, if the Company Board (A)
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel
and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be
expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) has
received from the Person so requesting such information an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_  that any such access, information or
data has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time such access, information or data
is provided to such Person or group;

 

(iii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote,
contacting and engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person or
group and their respective Representatives who has made an Acquisition
Proposal that was not initiated, solicited, encouraged (in any material
respect) or facilitated (in any material respect) in violation of this
Agreement if the Company Board shall have determined in

 



39

    

 good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisor,
that such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to constitute,
result in, or lead to a Superior Proposal; 

(iv) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, making
a Change of Recommendation (but only if permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.3_);
or

(v) resolving or agreeing to take any of the foregoing actions, to the
extent such actions would be permitted by the foregoing clauses _(i)_ through
(iv) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ to the contrary,
if, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite
Vote, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, in response to a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated, solicited, encouraged (in any
material respect) or facilitated (in any material respect) in violation of
this Agreement, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company or the Company Board may (and may resolve or agree to)
(i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_ (
_Superior Proposal_ ) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal or (ii) effect a Change of Recommendation
in accordance with clause (x)(A) of _Section_ __ _ 6.3_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if the Company terminates the Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ ), the Company pays to
Parent the Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)(i)_ concurrently with or prior to such termination; _provided_ ,
_further_ that the Company will not be entitled to enter into such definitive
agreement and to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.1(d)(ii)_ or effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to clause (x)(A) of
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_ unless (x) the Company delivers to Parent a written
notice (a " _Company Notice_ "), advising Parent that the Company Board
proposes to take such action and containing the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
Company Board (including the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal and copies of any written proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and (y) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth
(5th) Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company
delivered the Company Notice (such period from the time the Company Notice is
provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth (5th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice, the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause
its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company agrees to notify
Parent promptly if it determines during such Notice Period not to terminate
this Agreement and enter into the definitive agreement referred to in the
Company Notice. Any material amendment to the terms of a proposed agreement
relating to a Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new proposal or
proposed agreement relating to a Superior Proposal for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_, including with respect to the Notice Period (except
that references to the five (5) Business Day period above shall be deemed to
be references to a three (3) Business Day period; _provided_ that such new
Notice Period shall in no event shorten the original Notice Period).

Stockholders Meeting to the extent so determined to be necessary;  _provided_
, _further_ , that the Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed, recessed
or adjourned pursuant to this proviso to a date that is more than forty-five
(45) days after the date on which the Stockholders Meeting was originally

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company, acting through
the Company Board (or a committee thereof), shall (a) subject to  _Section_
__ _ 6.1(c)_, include in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation, (b) include

the Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such
offer (any of the foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") and, following
such Change of Recommendation, shall no longer be obligated to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote (including no
longer being obligated to actively solicit proxies necessary to obtain the
Company Requisite Vote; _provided_ that, the Company shall provide Parent with

Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) there exists any event,
development, change, effect or occurrence that was not known by the Company
Board or, if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable, as of the date of this Agreement, (y) if it shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company,
that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(z)(A) if such Change of Recommendation is made in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company complies with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _
6.1(c)_ or (B) if such Change of Recommendation is not made in response to an

Change of Recommendation, the Company nevertheless shall submit this

Stockholders Meeting unless and until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

bonus program for each Company Employee in respect of the value and in the
manner specified in _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries to provide, from the Effective Time until the twenty-four (24)
month anniversary of the Effective Time, severance payments and benefits to
each Company Employee whose employment is terminated during such period that
are no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits that such
Company Employee is eligible to receive under any applicable severance plan,
policy, practice or arrangement sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of such arrangement as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or, if greater, the severance
payments and benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its subsidiaries at the time of such termination.

(b) Parent hereby acknowledges that consummation of the Merger will
constitute a "change in control" (or similar term) of the Company under the
terms of the Material Company Plans, as applicable.

 

(c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual or other plan providing for post-employment benefits) under
the employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries (exclusive of the
Company and its subsidiaries) providing benefits to any Company Employee
after the Closing Date (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "),
each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and its subsidiaries 

 



50

    

 and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any Company Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a
Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause
its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (x) all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y)
any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

 

(d) Unless otherwise provided in a collective bargaining agreement,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, in its discretion,
pay to each participant in an annual bonus plan or program maintained by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries for the year in which the Closing occurs
(other than as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ with respect to a Company
Cash Incentive Award) a cash bonus in an amount equal to the greater of (i)
the target level of performance for the applicable performance criteria and
(ii) the level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria as of
the Effective Time as determined by the Company Board or a committee thereof
prior to the Effective Time, in each case, pro-rated based on the number
of days in the applicable performance period that have elapsed as of the
Effective Time; _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, Company Cash
Incentive Awards shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.2(e)_. 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the terms of each
collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement to which the Company
or any subsidiary of the Company is a party as of the Closing Date until each
such collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement otherwise
expires pursuant to its terms or is modified by the parties thereto. As
promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries shall undertake as soon as
practicable following the date hereof all necessary notifications to and
consultations with any works councils or unions as required by applicable Law
or the applicable labor agreement (the " _Consultation Processes_ "). The
Company shall keep Parent regularly informed of the status of the Consultation
Processes and to promptly provide Parent in advance, to the extent reasonably
practicable and legally permissible, with any material written communications
to be provided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the relevant trade
unions, works councils and other bodies, if any, and shall consult with
Parent in

 



51

    

 connection with any such communications, and give Parent a reasonable
opportunity to comment on them and take into account in good faith any
comments that Parent may make thereon. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall, without the Parents prior written consent, enter into any
agreement or understanding with, or make any commitment to, any trade unions,
works councils and other bodies that would impose any material obligations
on Parent or any of its Affiliates following the Closing (including with
respect to the terms of employment and employment benefits granted to
employees). Parent shall cooperate with the Company and its subsidiaries
in connection with any such provision of information or consultation.

(f) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, expressed or implied,
shall (i) be treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any
Company Plan or any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") or constitute a limitation on rights
to amend, modify, merge or terminate after the Effective Time any Company Plan
or Parent Plan, (ii) give any current or former employee, director or other
independent contractor of the Company and its subsidiaries (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof), or any labor organization, union, works
council, employee association, trade union, other similar employee
representative body, any third-party beneficiary or other rights or (iii)
obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular
Company Plan or Parent Plan or (B) retain the employment or services of any
current employee, officer, director or other independent contractor of the
Company and its subsidiaries.

Section 6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company and its subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding, litigation, arbitration, hearing or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or
informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ "), arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the
Company and its subsidiaries would have been permitted under Delaware Law and
its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person
(and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law) (including in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such
Proceeding, (x) neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter. In the event any Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Party and in which indemnification

 



52

    

 could be sought by such Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_,
(i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to any Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this clause (i) to pay
for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction
unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_ that the fewest number of
counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and
(iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent; and provided, further
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying Party.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the provisions in the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers shall be no less favorable to such directors and
officers than such provisions contained in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws in effect as of the date hereof.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that
in no event shall the Company expend for such policies a premium amount in
excess of the amount set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of
the date of this 

 



53

    

 Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement,
or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such 6-year period with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance
and; provided, further that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. If Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_. Parent agrees to honor
and perform under, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform
under, all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ (other than  _Section_ __
_ 6.10(g)_) (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs,
successors and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or under any
applicable Contracts or Laws.

 

(g) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall not take any action to
prevent the Companys subsidiaries from complying with any obligations or
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation (as
applicable) for periods prior to the Closing Date as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

(h) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee the prompt
payment of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and the Companys
subsidiaries under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 

Section 6.11 _Parent Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the
Financing Commitments (including complying with any request exercising so-
called "flex" provisions), including using reasonable best efforts to satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Financing Commitments, in
each case to the extent necessary to 

 



54

    

 consummate the Merger, to pay the amounts required in connection with the
Indian Offer and make the other payments required by Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation hereunder or otherwise contemplated in connection
herewith and repay or refinance the debt contemplated to be repaid pursuant to
the Financing Commitments. To the extent requested by the Company from time to
time, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing (or Alternative
Financing). In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in
the Financing Commitments for any reason, including, without limitation,
resulting from any cancellation pursuant to Clause 8.3 of the Credit
Facilities Agreement or otherwise, and such portion is reasonably required to
consummate the Merger, to pay the amounts required in connection with the
Indian Offer and make the other payments required by Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation hereunder or otherwise contemplated in connection
herewith and repay or refinance the debt contemplated to be repaid pursuant
to the Financing Commitments, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing and (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their
respective subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (the " _Alternative
Financing_ ") in an amount, when added with Parent and Merger Subs existing
cash on hand, which such cash is unrestricted and available to pay amounts
that would be required to consummate the Merger, to pay the amounts required
in connection with the Indian Offer and make the other payments required by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereunder or otherwise
contemplated in connection herewith and repay or refinance the debt
contemplated to be repaid pursuant to the Financing Commitments, sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event and which would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Financing or such Alternative Financing or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing (A) if
to Parents knowledge there exists any breach or default by any party to the
Financing Commitments (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default), (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any
written notice or other written communication from any lender or other
Financing source with respect to any actual breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitments or (C) if for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that there is a reasonable
possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Financing Commitments in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger, to pay
the amounts required in connection with the Indian Offer and make the other
payments required by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
hereunder or otherwise contemplated in connection herewith and repay or
refinance the debt contemplated to be repaid pursuant to the Financing
Commitments. As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding
sentence. Parent and Merger Sub shall not (without the prior written consent
of the Company) consent or agree to any amendment or modification to, or any
waiver of any provision under, the Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing if such amendment, modification or
waiver (1) decreases the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount that,
together with Parents and Merger Subs cash on hand, would be less than an
amount that would be required to consummate the Merger, to pay the amounts
required in connection with

 



55

    

 the Indian Offer and make the other payments required by Parent, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation hereunder or otherwise contemplated in
connection herewith and repay or refinance the debt contemplated to be repaid
pursuant to the Financing Commitments, (2) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing or otherwise would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the funding or financing described therein, (3) could
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (4) make the funding of
the Financing less likely to occur or (5) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the Financing Sources to
consummate the Financing; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt Parent
and Merger Sub shall be permitted to consent or agree to any amendment or
modification, or any waiver of any provision, under the Financing Commitment
if such amendment, modification or waiver (x) is solely a waiver of any
closing conditions by lender(s) or their agents or (y) solely adds lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed the Financing Commitments as of the date hereof as parties
thereto. Parent shall furnish to the Company a copy of any amendment,
modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the Financing Commitments
promptly upon execution thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Financing
Commitments, except to the extent replaced by Alternative Financing (subject
to the penultimate sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_), until the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. Upon any
amendment, supplement or modification of the Financing Commitments made in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_ Parent shall provide a copy
thereof to the Company and the term "Financing Commitments" shall mean the
Financing Commitments as so amended, supplemented or modified and Parents
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_ shall apply with respect
thereto, including with respect to any Alternative Financing.

 

(b) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
(1) voluntarily cancel, in whole or in part, an Available Facility or take any
action to reduce the Commitments under any Facility (unless at the same time
or prior thereto funds in an equivalent amount have been received from any
take-out financing, disposal or otherwise) or (2) unless in connection with a
primary syndication of, or as the Parent may otherwise be required under, the
Credit Facilities Agreement, permit, approve or otherwise consent to any
assignments, participations or novations of any Financing Sources Commitment
and/or Loan under any Facility or any Financing Sources failure to retain
exclusive control over all rights and obligations with respect to their
respective Commitments and/or Loans in respect of the applicable Facilities
until, in each case, the initial funding of the Financing Commitments on the
Closing Date (for the purpose of this sentence, "Available Facility",
"Commitments", "Facility", "Facilities" and "Loan" shall have the respective
meanings given to those terms in the Credit Facilities Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required (I) to amend or waive any of the terms
or conditions of the Financing Commitments or pay any fees in excess of or not
contemplated thereunder or (II) to consummate the Closing any earlier than
the time set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, provided, that, Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any
Alternative Financing or other financing, is not a condition to Closing.

 



56

    

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger
Sub, and shall cause its subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to
provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents sole cost and expense, all
reasonable cooperation requested by Parent for itself or on behalf of the
Financing Sources that is necessary in connection with the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments or any permitted replacement,
amendment or modification thereof or any Alternative Financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Available
Financing_ "), including using reasonable best efforts to take the following
actions: (i) furnishing Parent with (1) audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company consisting of balance sheets as of the last date of
each of the three (3) fiscal years of the Company ended at least ninety (90)
days prior to the Closing Date and statement of earnings and statements of
stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three (3) fiscal years of
the Company ended at least ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date, which
audited consolidated financial statements will be in a form substantially
consistent with those audited consolidated financial statements included in
the SEC Reports and (2) unaudited consolidated financial statements of the
Company consisting of balance sheets and statement of earnings as of the last
day of and for the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended at least
forty-five (45) days before the Closing Date, and, in the case of the
statement of cash flows, for the period from the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year ended at least ninety (90) days before the
Closing Date to the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter
ended at least forty-five (45) days before the Closing Date, other than with
respect to any quarter-end that is also a fiscal year-end, which unaudited
consolidated financial statements will be in a form substantially consistent
with those unaudited consolidated financial statements included in the SEC
Reports and such other pertinent financial and other information regarding
the Company and its subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent and
necessary in connection with any Available Financing; (ii) participating, if
requested and on reasonable notice, in a reasonable number of meetings,
drafting sessions, lender presentations, road shows, sessions with prospective
lenders and investors, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Financing and cooperating reasonably with
Available Financing sources due diligence, to the extent customary; (iii)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent for any Available
Financing; (iv) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the obtaining
of pay-off letters and lien terminations with respect to indebtedness of the
Company and its subsidiaries; (v) facilitating the pledging and perfection of
collateral with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries ( _provided_ that
(A) none of the documents or certificates shall be executed and/or delivered
except in connection with the Closing, (B) the effectiveness thereof shall be
conditioned upon, or become operative upon, the occurrence of the Closing and
(C) no liability shall be imposed on the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or
any of their respective officers or employees involved); (vi) to the extent
requested at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, providing
information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries reasonably required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and
(vii) reasonably cooperating with Parent in connection with the repayment and
discharge at or following Closing of the Companys existing indebtedness for
borrowed money (including the release of any guarantees and
applicable Liens). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the covenants of the
Company set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall not, in the context of
any Available Financing other than that contemplated by the Financing
Commitments as in effect on the date hereof, impose on the Company or any of
the Companys subsidiaries or any of its and their officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
Representatives, any significantly greater burden, obligation or time
commitment than those that had been (or would have been) imposed on them in
the context of either the Financing contemplated by the Financing

 



57

    

 Commitments as in effect on the date hereof or that would reasonably be
expected of a target company in a transaction of this type on customary terms,
(y) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay
any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments, to
bear any cost or expense that Parent has not unconditionally agreed to
promptly reimburse or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time, and (z) nothing
in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall require any action that would conflict
with or violate the Companys or any subsidiaries organizational documents or
any Laws or result in the contravention of, or that would reasonably
be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a default under, any
Contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party. For the
avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or its subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors (with respect to any subsidiary of the
Company) or employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform
any agreement with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Closing and no directors of the Company shall be
required to approve, execute or enter into or perform any agreement with
respect to the Financing. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of
the Companys and its subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing;
_provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their logos and on such other customary terms and
conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose.

 

(d) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents, investment bankers and other
representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and the performance
of their respective obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ (including
any action taken in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than (x) information
provided by the Company or its subsidiaries in writing specifically for
inclusion in connection therewith or (y) to the extent arising from the
willful misconduct, gross negligence or fraud of any indemnified
Person). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by the
Company or its subsidiaries in connection with this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_
(including those of its accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents,
investment bankers and other representatives). Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any Alternative
Financing or other financing, is not a condition to Closing.

Section 6.12 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any
stockholder litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought against the Company or
any members of the Company Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall
promptly notify Parent of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company
shall control the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation and the Company shall not settle or agree to settle any Transaction
Litigation without Parents prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and shall allow Parent to participate in,
any Transaction Litigation and shall otherwise consider in good faith Parents
advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation.

 



58

    

Section 6.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement,
the Financing Commitments and any Alternative Financing.

 

Section 6.14 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual (including any Person who is deemed to be a
"director by deputization" under applicable securities Laws) who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

Section 6.15 _Indian Offer_. Parent agrees to timely perform its
obligations under the SEBI Takeover Code, including the requirement of
conducting the Indian Offer and timely making the public announcements
required in respect thereof, in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. At the request
of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its Representatives with respect to the Indian Offer
and Parents obligations under the preceding sentence.

 

Section 6.16 _Liability Management Transactions_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of any written request
by Parent or Merger Sub to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to commence offers to purchase (including change of control offers)
and/or consent solicitations related to any or all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount and all other amounts in respect of the Companys
senior unsecured notes due respectively in 2023, 2026 and 2028 (the "
_Existing Notes_ "), on such terms and conditions, including pricing terms,
that are specified and requested, from time to time, by Parent (each a "
_Liability Management Transaction_ " and collectively, the " _Liability
Management Transactions_ ") and Parent shall assist the Company in connection
therewith; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.16_, (i) Parent shall only request the Company to conduct
any Liability Management Transaction in compliance with the documents
governing the applicable debt securities and applicable securities Laws, (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to bear any
cost or expense that Parent has not unconditionally agreed to promptly
reimburse or to pay any fee or make any other payment prior to the Effective
Time, and (iii) nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ shall require any
action that would conflict with or violate the Companys or any subsidiaries
organizational documents or any Laws or result in the contravention of, or
that would reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a
default under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
a party. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with any Liability Management Transaction, including
using reasonable best efforts in assisting with the preparation of any
customary documentation related thereto. Parent shall consult with the Company
regarding the material terms and conditions of any Liability Management
Transaction, including the timing 

 



59

    

 of any Liability Management Transaction and any deadlines. Parent, and its
counsel, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review all documentation
with respect to any Liability Management Transaction before it is distributed
to holders of the Existing Notes or filed with the SEC, as applicable, and the
Company shall accept any reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent or its counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing
of any Liability Management Transaction shall be conditioned on the occurrence
of the Closing, and the parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause any Liability Management Transaction to close on the Closing
Date. The Company (i) shall waive any of the conditions to any Liability
Management Transaction (other than the occurrence of the Closing) and make any
change to the terms of a Liability Management Transaction, in each case, as
may be reasonably requested by Parent and (ii) shall not, without the written
consent of Parent, waive any condition to any Liability Management Transaction
or make any changes to any Liability Management Transaction. Parent shall
ensure that, at the Effective Time, the Company has all funds necessary to
pay for any Existing Notes that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to any Liability Management Transaction. Any dealer manager,
solicitation agent, information agent, depositary, paying agent and/or any
other agents retained in connection with any Liability Management Transaction
shall be selected by Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Without limiting this  _Section_ __ _ 6.16_, the Company shall enter into
customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected and
on terms and conditions acceptable to Parent and the Company. Parent
acknowledges that the consummation of any Liability Management Transaction is
not a condition to Closing.

(b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents, investment bankers and other
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred in connection with their cooperation with the
consummation of any Liability Management Transaction and the performance of
their respective obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ (including any
action taken in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than to the extent arising
from the willful misconduct, gross negligence or fraud of any indemnified
Person). Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all documented out-
of-pocket third party costs and expenses incurred by the Company or
its subsidiaries in connection with this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ (including
those of its accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
representatives).

64

    

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant

and (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement, but prior to the date of

by wire transfer of immediately available funds. For the purpose of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(ii)_, all references in the definition of the term
Acquisition Proposal to "20% or more" will be deemed to be references to
"more than 50%" and an Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to have been
"publicly withdrawn" by any Person if, within twelve (12) months of such
termination, the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or shall have
consummated an Acquisition Proposal made by or on behalf of such Person or any
of its Affiliates.

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant

Antitrust Law, (B) the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_ (other
than the conditions set forth in (x)  _Section 7.1(b)_ with respect to the
Order or other action described in the foregoing clause (A) and (y) _Section

divest some or all of the Parent Retained Business as a condition to Closing,
(2) the Parties failure to divest some or all of the Specified Business,
after complying with their respective covenants and obligations set forth in

of the Parent Retained Business is effectuated, (B) the conditions to Closing
set forth in _Section 7.1_ (other than the condition set forth in _Section
7.1(c)_ ) and _Section 7.2_ would be satisfied at the Closing, and the
Company has complied with its obligations under _Section 6.4(e)_ , (C) at the
time of such termination neither the Specified Business

 



65

    

 nor the Parent Retained Business (or such portion of the Specified Business
or the Parent Retained Business as required by the applicable Governmental
Entity) has been divested and (D) the failure to divest the Parent Retained
Business (or applicable portion of the Parent Retained Business) is the result
of Parents refusal to divest some or all of the Parent Retained Business

accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.4(e)_ , then Parent shall pay the
Reverse Termination Fee to the Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination),
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall (i)

agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Parent is entitled to
receive the Termination Fee and Parent receives such Termination Fee and does
not, promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt

such Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its
Affiliates against the Company and any of its former, current and future
Affiliates, and each of their respective former, current and future direct
or indirect directors, officers, employees, stockholders, other equity
holders, controlling Persons or Representatives (each, a " _Company Related
Party_ ") or any Company Related Party of any Company Related Party for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement (including termination of this Agreement), or in respect of any
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection with this

Company, its subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall have no
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
(including termination thereof) or in respect of representations made or

to or promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt of
the Termination Fee, rejects and returns such payment and foregoes its
entitlement thereto, it shall not be precluded by anything in this _Section_
__ _ 8.2(e)_ from making a claim against the Company for damages resulting
from any Willful Breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in any circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and the
Company is entitled to receive the Reverse Termination Fee and the Company
receives such Reverse Termination Fee and does not, promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt thereof, reject and return
such payment and forego its entitlement thereto, such Reverse Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates
against Parent and any of its former, current and future Affiliates, and each
of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, other equity holders, controlling Persons
or Representatives (each, a " _Parent Related Party_ ") or any Parent Related
Party of any Parent Related Party for any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement (including termination
of this Agreement), or in respect of any representation made or alleged to
have been made in connection with this Agreement, and upon payment and
acceptance of such Reverse Termination Fee, Parent, its subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates shall have no further liability or obligation
relating

 



66

    

 to or arising out of this Agreement (including termination thereof) or in
respect of representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith,
whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, except in the
case of fraud. If the Company, prior to or promptly (and in any event within
one (1) Business Day) after receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee, rejects
and returns such payment and foregoes its entitlement thereto, it shall not
be precluded by anything in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ from making a claim
against Parent for damages resulting from any Willful Breach.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company, on behalf
of itself and the Company Related Parties, hereby (i) acknowledges that none
of the Financing Related Parties shall have any liability to the Company or
any Company Related Party under this Agreement or for any claim made by the

Party relating to this Agreement, the Financing (or Alternative Financing) or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (iii) agrees not to
commence (and, if commenced, agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not
to assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,
petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any Financing
Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Financing, the Financing
Commitment or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Without
limiting the foregoing, no Financing Related Party shall be subject to any
special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious
nature to a Company Related Party. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(f)_
shall in any way (a) expand the circumstances in which the Company or any
Company Related Party may be liable under this Agreement or as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including as a result of the Financing) or
(b) limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the
Financing Commitments to each other thereunder or in connection therewith.

Section 8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
each Party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

jurisdiction)) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware _provided_ that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, any disputes involving the Financing Related Parties will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause

Section 9.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this

reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission, ".pdf", or other electronic

separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
(including the right of a party to cause the other parties to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
Parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ by Parent or Merger Sub and
to cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.2_, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement. Each of
the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) either Party has an adequate remedy at law (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity or (z) a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason. Any Party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Order. The
election of either Party to pursue an injunction or specific performance
shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit such Party from subsequently
seeking to terminate this Agreement and seeking to collect damages in respect
of the other Partys liability arising out of a Willful Breach of any
agreement or covenant of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_.

Section 9.13 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) consents
to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon
or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other

 



76

    

 request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the courts of the State of Delaware,
as described above and (d) consents to service being made through the notice
procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and the Parties further waive any argument
that such service is insufficient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall be entitled to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in
Germany solely to enforce a judgment relating to the implementation of this
Agreement. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of Delaware for any reason, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay
the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the Party
is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction.
Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be
irrevocable under the Laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States
of America;  _provided_ that each such Partys consent to jurisdiction and
service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ is solely for the purpose
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and shall not be deemed to be a
general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for
such purpose. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not bring or
support any litigation against the lenders under the Financing in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing,
the Financing Commitments or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the
City of New York, whether a state or federal court, and that the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 9.14_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any
such action, suit or proceeding. Parent irrevocably designates the Corporation
Trust Company as its agent and attorney-in-fact for the acceptance of service
of process and making an appearance on its behalf in any such claim or
proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be necessary, proper or
advisable in order to confer jurisdiction over it, and Parent stipulates that
such consent and appointment are irrevocable and coupled with an interest.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, at
law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, against or including any
Financing Related Party in any way relating to this Agreement, including any
dispute arising under or relating to any agreement entered into by any
Financing Related Party in connection with the Financing or any Alternative
Financing, or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the State courts, the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York.

limitation." The words "hereof", "herein", "hereto", "hereby" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or" shall not be exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not simply mean "if." The definitions contained in this

terms. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the masculine,
feminine or neuter as the context may require. Any agreement, instrument or
Law defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise
specifically indicated and except that, for purposes of any representations
and warranties in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date,
references to any specific instrument or Law will be deemed to refer to such
instrument or Law as of such date. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors or assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all
references to "dollars" or "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money
of United States of America. The word "will" shall be construed to have the
same meaning and effect as the word "shall." With respect to the
determination of any period of time, unless otherwise set forth herein, "from"
means "from and including" and "to" means "to but excluding" and if the last
day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end at
the close of the next succeeding Business Day. The terms

refer to calendar year(s). For purposes of this Agreement, any document

provides for the Company delivering, providing, furnishing or making available
(or phrase of similar import) following the date of this Agreement, otherwise
made available for review by Parent or its Representatives, whether in person,
electronically or through the Data Room, shall, in each case, be deemed to
have been "delivered", "provided", "furnished" or "made available" (or any
phrase of similar import) to Parent by the Company. The information contained
in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and Exhibit hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be
an admission by any Party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever
(including, without limitation, any violation of law or breach of contract).
No summary of this Agreement or any Exhibit, Schedule or other document
delivered herewith prepared by or on behalf of any Party will affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or such Exhibit or Schedule

Section 9.17 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.
