(the " _Interests_ ") in (x) AES Ironwood, L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Ironwood LLC_ "), and (y) AES Prescott, L.L.C., a

");

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase, and Seller desires to sell to Buyer, on
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Interests.

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

_Definitions and Rules of Construction_

 

SECTION 1.01 _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this Agreement or in _Exhibit A_
hereto.

SECTION 1.02 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall be deemed references to
Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement.

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall
have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a
verb). Terms defined in the singular have the corresponding meanings in the
plural, and vice versa. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires
otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and
neutral genders and vice versa. The term "includes" or "including" shall mean
"including without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby,"
"herein," "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
section or article in which such words appear. The word "or" shall not be
exclusive.

(c) Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Whenever any action
must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such
action may be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day. (d) The Parties acknowledge that each Party and its attorney have reviewed
this Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party, or any similar rule
operating against the drafter of an agreement, shall not be applicable to the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

(e) The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement.

(f) All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall
have the meanings given to them under GAAP.

ARTICLE 2

SECTION 2.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Interests; Closing_. (a) On the terms
of and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in
this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, and Parent agrees to cause
Seller to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase, the Interests.

(b) Upon the terms of and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller will sell,
assign, convey, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and

and the Debt Service Reserve Term Loan and (b) expressly identified in this

amount) obtained by subtracting the Target Net Working Capital from the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, plus (iii) the amount (whether expressed as

set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction of such
conditions at the Closing), or at such other time, date and place as may be
mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties; provided that if the
assignment, transfer, assumption and acceptance contemplated by Section
6.13(a) has not occurred by the tenth day prior to the date on which the
Closing would otherwise occur, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, delay the
Closing for up to ten (10) days after the Closing would otherwise have
occurred (the date on which the Closing actually occurs being referred to as
the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be effective for all purposes at
00:00:01 Eastern Prevailing Time on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_

required to be delivered by Seller at or prior to the Closing pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or as are otherwise reasonably required in connection
herewith.

 



3 (b) Buyer will deliver the following to Seller or its designees:

 

(i) Payment of the Estimated Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately

the Interests to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,

SECTION 2.03 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

(a) After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other
and provide each other with such access to their respective books, records and
relevant employees (and those of the Acquired Companies) as they may
reasonably request in connection with the matters addressed in this Section
2.03, provided that nothing contained in this Section 2.03(a) shall require
Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to disclose any attorney-
client privileged information to the extent that disclosure thereof might
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege. Within ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Buyer s
Statement_") setting forth its calculation of the Purchase Price (including
the Closing Date Net Working Capital and the Closing Date Net Indebtedness
Amount) together with reasonable supporting information and calculations.

(b) If Seller objects to any matter set forth on Buyers Statement, then
Seller shall provide Buyer written notice thereof within thirty (30) days
after receiving Buyers Statement specifying in reasonable detail all disputed
items and the basis therefor; _provided_ that Seller and Buyer shall be deemed
to have agreed upon all items and amounts that are not so disputed by Seller
in such written notice. If the Parties are unable to agree on any matter set
forth on Buyers Statement disputed by Seller in accordance with this Section
2.03(b) within 150 days after the Closing Date, the Parties shall refer such
dispute to Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if that firm declines to act as provided
in this Section 2.03(b), another firm of independent public accountants,
selected promptly by and mutually reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller
(the " _Independent Accountants_ "), which firm shall make a final and binding
determination as to only those matters in dispute with respect to this Section
2.03(b) on a timely basis, and in any event within thirty (30) days following
its appointment, and promptly shall notify the Parties in writing of its
resolution. The Independent Accountants shall not have the power to modify or
amend any term or provision of this Agreement or modify previously agreed to
items among the Parties. Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall be liable for and pay one-half of the fees and other costs
charged by the Independent Accountants. If Seller does not object to any
matter set forth on Buyers Statement within the

 



4  time period and in the manner set forth in the first sentence of this
Section 2.03(b) or if Seller accepts the Closing Date Net Working Capital and
the Closing Date Net Indebtedness Amount set forth on Buyers Statement, such
Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing Date Net Indebtedness Amount
shall become final and binding upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder.

 

(c) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined as provided in Section
2.03(b) (as agreed between the Parties or as determined by the Independent
Accountants or otherwise), (i) exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, then
Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the amount of such excess, within
five (5) Business Days after such amounts are agreed or determined pursuant
to Section 2.03(b), plus interest thereon at the Specified Rate from the
Closing Date to the date of payment, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller; or (ii) is less than
the Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay Buyer an amount equal to
the amount of such shortfall, within five (5) Business Days after such amounts
are agreed or determined pursuant to Section 2.03(b), plus interest thereon at
the Specified Rate from the Closing Date to the date of payment, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer; or
(iii) is equal to the Purchase Price, then no payment shall be made pursuant
to this Section 2.03.

jurisdiction of organization. Each of Parent and Seller is duly qualified or
licensed to do business in each other jurisdiction where the actions required

expected to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.02 _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by each
of Parent and Seller of this Agreement and the other agreements and
instruments to be delivered hereunder, and the consummation by each of Parent

delivery by Buyer) a valid and legally binding obligation of each of Parent
and Seller, enforceable against each of Parent and Seller in accordance with
its terms, subject in all respects to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to

5 SECTION 3.03 _Consents of Parent and Seller; Litigation_. No material

_Consent_ ") of, or material registration, declaration or filing (each, a "

connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
agreements and instruments to be delivered hereunder by Parent or Seller and

arbitration, governmental investigation or other legal, judicial or
administrative proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or
Seller, threatened, against Parent or Seller or any of their Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Companies) that would in the aggregate reasonably be
expected (x) to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect or (y) to
materially interfere with the ability of the Acquired Companies to conduct
their business as currently conducted or to utilize their properties, assets
and rights as currently utilized.

 

SECTION 3.04 _Noncontravention_. Subject to Parent or Seller obtaining the
Sellers Required Consents, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other agreements and instruments to be delivered hereunder

contravene or violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of Parent
or Seller or (b) contravene or violate any provision of, or result in the loss
or deferral of any right under or the termination or acceleration of,
or entitle any Person to receive any penalty or premium or to terminate or
accelerate any obligation or indebtedness under, or constitute a default (or
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, any Contract, Law, order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to
which Parent or Seller is a party or by which Parent or Seller is bound,
except for any such items which would not in the aggregate reasonably be
expected (x) to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect, (y) to materially
interfere with the ability of the Acquired Companies to conduct their business
as currently conducted or to utilize their properties, assets and rights as
currently utilized, or (z) to impose any material obligation or liability on
the Acquired Companies.

SECTION 3.05 _Title_. Seller is, and as of the Closing will be, the direct
legal and beneficial owner of, and has and at the Closing shall have, good and
marketable title to, all the Interests, free and clear of all Liens other than
those (a) that secure the Bond Indebtedness and the Debt Service Reserve
Term Loan, (b) expressly identified in this Agreement, or (c) arising

respective Affiliates has any liability or obligation to pay fees or
commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for which Buyer or its Affiliates (including

Effect. Seller has provided to Buyer true and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents of each of the Acquired Companies.

 

SECTION 4.02 _Capitalization and Subsidiaries_. The legal name, jurisdiction
of organization and respective ownership of each of the Acquired Companies is

phantom stock, profit participation or other similar rights in or issued by
any other Person, and no such interests, securities or rights are outstanding

agreement or any Contract restricting or otherwise relating to the voting,
dividend rights or disposition of such interests.

SECTION 4.03 _Governmental Consents of the Acquired Companies_. No material

license agreements that, by their terms, provide such Acquired Company with
adequate rights to use all material Intellectual Property licensed to it by
others (the " _Licensed Intellectual Property_ "). To the Knowledge of Parent
and Seller, the licensors of the Licensed Intellectual Property have adequate
rights to license all Licensed Intellectual Property to the Acquired
Companies. The Owned Intellectual Property and the Licensed Intellectual
Property constitute all material Intellectual Property necessary for the
operation of the business of the Acquired Companies in the manner in which
such business is currently being conducted or to utilize its properties,
assets and rights as currently utilized. Neither Parent nor Seller has
Knowledge of (a) any material infringement or claimed infringement by either
Acquired Company of any Intellectual Property of others or (b) any material
infringement of any Intellectual Property owned by either Acquired Company.
Section 4.19 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth all material
Intellectual Property that is owned or licensed by or through any Affiliate
of either Acquired Company (other than the other Acquired Company) that will
not be transferred to one of the Acquired Companies prior to Closing.

 

SECTION 4.20 _FERC Status_. Ironwood LLC maintains Exempt Wholesale Generator
status granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and continues to
meet all applicable requirements associated with the maintenance of that
status. Ironwood LLC is authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
under the Federal Power Act to make sales of electric capacity and energy at
market-based rates. To the Knowledge of Parent or Seller, there are no facts
that are reasonably likely to cause Ironwood LLC to lose its status as an
"Exempt Wholesale Generator" or its market-based rate authorization. 

SECTION 4.21 _Exclusive Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article 3 and this Article 4 (as
modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedule), neither Parent nor Seller nor any
other Person on their behalf makes any other express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to Parent, Seller, the Acquired Companies or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent and Seller disclaim
any other representations or warranties, whether made by Parent, Seller, the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives. 

 



18 ARTICLE 5

Except as disclosed in the corresponding section (or another section in

Buyer and Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
in its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of Buyer and Guarantor is duly
qualified or licensed to do business in each other jurisdiction where the
actions required to be performed by it hereunder makes such qualification or

perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 5.02 _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by each
of Buyer and Guarantor of this Agreement and the other agreements and
instruments to be delivered hereunder and the consummation by each of Buyer
and Guarantor of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are within
Buyers powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action on
the part of each of Buyer and Guarantor. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Buyer and Guarantor. This Agreement
constitutes (assuming the due execution and delivery by each of the other
Parties hereto) a valid and legally binding obligation of each of Buyer and
Guarantor, enforceable against each of Buyer and Guarantor in accordance with
its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally and general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

SECTION 5.03 _Consents of Buyer and Guarantor_. No Consent of, or Filing with,
any Governmental Entity which has not been obtained or made by Buyer or
Guarantor is required to be obtained or made by Buyer or Guarantor in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
agreements and instruments to be delivered hereunder by Buyer and Guarantor
and the consummation by Buyer and Guarantor of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, other than (a) the Buyers Required Consents
and (b) the Consents and Filings the failure of which to obtain or make would
not in the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse
effect on Buyers or Guarantors ability to perform its obligations hereunder
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or subject Parent or
Seller, or any employees thereof, to any criminal or civil sanctions or
penalties.

 

SECTION 5.04 _Noncontravention_. Subject to Buyer obtaining the Buyers
Required Consents, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the other agreements

 



19  and instruments to be delivered hereunder by each of Buyer and Guarantor
does not, and the consummation by each of Buyer and Guarantor of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (a) contravene or
violate any provision of the organizational or constitutional documents of
Buyer or Guarantor or (b) contravene or violate any provision of, or result in
the loss or deferral of any right under or the termination or acceleration
of, or entitle any party to terminate or accelerate any obligation or
indebtedness under, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, any Contract, Law,
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Buyer or Guarantor is a
party or by which Buyer or Guarantor is bound, except to the extent that any
such items would not in the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on Buyers or Guarantors ability to perform its
obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 5.05 _Litigation_. There are no Claims pending or, to Buyers
Knowledge, threatened, against or otherwise relating to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates before any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator, that would in
the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on
Buyers ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer is not subject to any judgment,
decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator
that prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or would in the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on Buyers ability to perform its obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 5.06 _Compliance with Laws_. Buyer is not, and since January 1, 2008
has not been, in violation of any Law, except for violations that would not in
the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect
on Buyers ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 5.07 _Brokers_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates have any
liability or obligation to pay fees or commissions to any broker, finder or
agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
which Seller or their Affiliates are or could become liable or obliged.

SECTION 5.08  _Investment Intent_. Buyer acknowledges that neither the offer
nor the sale of the Interests has been registered under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), or under any state or foreign
securities laws. Buyer is acquiring the Interests for its own account for
investment, without a view to, or for a resale in connection with, the
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
state or foreign securities laws and with no present intention of distributing
or reselling any part thereof. Buyer will not so distribute or resell any of
the Interests in violation of any such laws.

 

SECTION 5.09 _Available Funds; Source of Funds_. Buyer has, or as of the
Closing will have, sufficient cash or other sources of immediately available
funds to pay in cash the Purchase Price in accordance with Article 2 and for
all other actions necessary for Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. Buyer represents and warrants that all funds
paid to Seller shall not have been derived from, or constitute, either
directly or indirectly, the proceeds of any criminal activity under the anti-
money laundering laws of the United States.

 



20 SECTION 5.10 _Investigation_. Buyer is a sophisticated entity, knowledgeable
about the industry in which the Acquired Companies operate, experienced in
investments in such businesses and able to bear the economic risk associated
with the purchase of the Interests. Buyer has such knowledge and experience as
to be aware of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the purchase of
interests of the type contemplated in this Agreement, as well as the knowledge
of the Acquired Companies and their operations in particular, and has
independently made its own analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Buyer had access to the books, records, facilities and personnel of
the Acquired Companies, including all documents made available to Buyer in the
electronic data-room established by Seller, for purposes of conducting its
due diligence investigation of the Acquired Companies.

SECTION 5.11 _Disclaimer Regarding Projections_. Buyer may be in possession
of certain projections and other forecasts regarding the Acquired Companies,
including but not limited to projected financial statements, cash flow items
and other data of the Acquired Companies and certain business plan information
of the Acquired Companies. Buyer acknowledges that there are substantial
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections and other
forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that
Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it, and that Buyer shall have no claim against anyone with
respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that, without limiting the
generality of Section 4.21, neither Seller nor any of their Affiliates,
Representatives, agents or advisors has made any representation or warranty
with respect to such projections and other forecasts and plans. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.11 shall limit the rights of Buyer with respect to
any representation or warranty of Parent or Seller contained in this Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto).

 

SECTION 5.12 _Tolling Agreement_. The Tolling Agreement constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of PPL EnergyPlus, LLC and is in full force and
effect. PPL EnergyPlus, LLC is not in material breach or violation of, or
default under, or has taken, or failed to take, any action which action or
failure to act has entitled or would entitle Ironwood LLC to withhold
or suspend performance under, or has resulted or would result in a material
financial penalty under, the Tolling Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.13 _Exclusive Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article 5 (as modified by the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule), neither Buyer nor any other Person on its behalf
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Buyer or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer
disclaims any other representations or warranties, whether made by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives.

ARTICLE 6 

_Covenants_

SECTION 6.01 _Information_. (a) From the date of this Agreement through the
Closing, Parent and Seller shall (i) provide Buyer and its Representatives
with information as to the Acquired Companies and their operations, as
reasonably requested by and in a form reasonably

 



21  acceptable to Buyer and (ii) afford Buyer and its Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the Representatives, properties,
books and records, Contracts and other documents of or pertaining to the
Acquired Companies or that are reasonably required by the Acquired Companies
to demonstrate compliance with Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
Seller shall not be required to provide any information (A) which Parent or
Seller reasonably believes (1) it or the Acquired Companies are prohibited
from providing to Buyer by reason of applicable Law, (2) would compromise any
applicable attorney/client privilege, or (3) it or the Acquired Companies are
required to keep confidential or prevent access to by reason of any Contract
with a third party in effect on the date hereof or (B) relating to pricing or
other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or
portions thereof) or information, as determined by Parents and Sellers
counsel, could reasonably be expected to result in a violation of any
antitrust laws, rules or regulations. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein, from the date of this Agreement through the Closing, Buyer shall not
be permitted to contact any of the Acquired Companies employees (provided
that the foregoing shall not preclude Affiliates of Buyer from engaging in
ordinary course communications in relation to the Tolling Agreement),
vendors, customers or suppliers, or any Governmental Entities (except in
connection with applications for governmental approvals in connection with
this Agreement) regarding the operations or legal status of the Acquired
Companies without receiving prior written authorization from Parent or Seller.

(b) Without limiting Section 6.01(a), Parent shall provide to Buyer, no later
than February 28, 2012, a copy of the program, including any procedures, that
is used for the purpose of complying with the reliability standards of the
North American Electric Reliability Corporation that apply to Ironwood LLC as
a result of its status as a "Registered Entity" thereunder.

(c) Without limiting Section 6.01(a), following the Closing, Parent and Seller
shall be entitled to retain copies (at Parents and Sellers sole cost and
expense) of all books and records (including Tax Returns and materials
related to Taxes with respect to the Acquired Companies) relating to its
ownership and/or operation of the Acquired Companies and their businesses
prior to Closing. Following the Closing, Parent and Seller shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates to, afford to Buyer and Buyers Representatives, at
Buyers expense, reasonable access to, and provide copies of, any books and
records retained by Parent or Seller or their Affiliates (including
Acquired Companies Books and Records not yet delivered to Buyer pursuant to
Section 6.05) that relate to the operations of the Acquired Companies or are
reasonably required by the Acquired Companies to demonstrate compliance with
Law, but such access need be given only with respect to the portion of such
books and records as are related to the operations of the Acquired Companies
or are reasonably required by the Acquired Companies to demonstrate compliance
with Law. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 6.04, all
information provided by Parent or Seller pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall
be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) Without limiting Section 6.01(a)(ii), from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing:

(i) Parent and Seller shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, provide
one Representative of Buyer selected by Buyer (and, as reasonably requested by
Buyer from 

 



22  time to time, one or more additional such Representatives) (the " _On-Site
Representatives_ ") reasonable access to the Acquired Companies
Representatives, properties and operations during all business and operating
hours, and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to assist the On-
Site Representatives to familiarize themselves with, and to monitor the
planning or preparation for, or action taken in connection with, the major
outage currently planned for the AES Ironwood electric generation facility
located in Lebanon, Pennsylvania (the " _Facility_ ") to take place in May
2012 (the " _CT12 Outage_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, while at the
Facility, each On-Site Representative shall comply with all of the Acquired
Companies safety and security policies and procedures and shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business of the Acquired Companies;

(ii) the On-Site Representatives shall be provided notice of, and at least one
On-Site Representative shall be permitted, if permitted by Siemens Energy,
Inc. (" _Siemens_ ") (which permission the Parties will use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain), to participate in, all material discussions with
Siemens or its representatives regarding: (A) planning or preparation for the
CT12 Outage; or (B) any potential corrective actions necessary or advisable to
enable the combustion turbine known as CT11 to operate, following the Closing,
within its permitted emissions levels without adjusting the Combustion
Turbine Firing Curve (as defined in the Term Warranty Agreement) and otherwise
consistent with the Parties expectations regarding post-outage operational
performance following the major outage of such unit in January and February
2012 as described in the Term Warranty Agreement (the " _CT11 Outage Matters_
");

(iii) Seller will not, and will not permit Ironwood LLC to, agree to any
material corrective actions or settle or compromise any warranty claims with
respect to the CT11 Outage Matters without Buyers prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;

 

(iv) if requested by Buyer in writing and if permitted by applicable Law,
Seller will, and will cause Ironwood LLC to, take all such actions as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer (and at Buyers sole cost and expense)
concerning matters under the Term Warranty Agreement expected to occur
following Closing, including (A) to postpone and reschedule commencement of
the CT12 Outage to a date selected by Buyer, and (B) to enter into such change
orders under, or other amendments to, the Term Warranty Agreement as are
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller to effectuate such postponement
or otherwise amend the scope of work under the Term Warranty Agreement, in
each case as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in order to avoid the
occurrence, following the Closing, of issues similar to the CT11 Outage
Matters in connection with the CT12 Outage; provided, that if the Closing
shall not occur for any reason other than a breach by Seller of its
representations, warranties, or covenants under this Agreement, Buyer shall
nonetheless be responsible for all incremental costs and expenses incurred by
the Acquired Companies to the extent that such costs and expenses result from,
and would not have been incurred in the absence of, any such actions taken at
the request of Buyer (including actions taken by the Acquired Companies to
unwind any changes made to the Term Warranty Agreements) or to the scope and
timing of actions to be taken thereunder; and provided further, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein Buyers obligations
under this Section 6.01(d)(iv) shall survive any termination or expiration of
this Agreement; and

 



23 (v) if required by Siemens as a condition to Buyers participation
in discussions and negotiations contemplated by this Section 6.01(d), Buyer
will enter into such additional confidentiality agreements or similar
instruments as may be reasonably requested by Siemens, provided that Buyer
shall be permitted to participate in the discussions and negotiations
regarding the terms thereof directly with Siemens.

SECTION 6.02 _Conduct of Business Pending the Closing_. (a) Subject to
paragraph (c) below, from the date of this Agreement through the Closing,
Parent and Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies to be operated in the
ordinary course of business, and in compliance in all material respects with
all Material Contracts, Permits and applicable Law, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve, maintain and protect their assets in
compliance in all material respects with all Material Contracts, Permits and
applicable Law, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve their
relationships with Governmental Entities, counterparties to the Material
Contracts and other lessors, licensors, suppliers and customers with which any
of the Acquired Companies has a material relationship. Without limiting the
foregoing, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement or set
forth in Section 6.02 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or as consented to in
writing by Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, from the date of this Agreement through the Closing,
Parent and Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies not to do the following
(and shall not take any action that would result in any of the following with
respect to the Acquired Companies or the Interests):

(i) sell, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of (A) any material assets
other than pursuant to the Term Warranty Agreement or (B) any other assets
outside the ordinary course of business;

individual litigation or claim or $250,000 in the aggregate;

held by it thereunder, or take, or fail to take, any action which action or

any Tax election; (y) settle or compromise any Tax proceeding (including any

or after the Closing Date or (II) Buyer or (B) adopt any change, other than
as required by GAAP or applicable Law, in their financial accounting policies,

(c) Without limiting Section 6.02(a), from the date of this Agreement through
the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, consult
with Buyer, and reasonably consider Buyers input, with respect to scheduling,
planning and preparing for any scheduled outage involving Scheduled Outage
Services (as defined in the Term Warranty Agreement) at the Facility that is
reasonably expected to occur or be ongoing on or after the Closing Date,
including facility needs, purchase of materials and staffing and vendor
arrangements.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing,
Parent and Seller shall cause each intercompany account and other obligation
existing between the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Parent or Seller
or any of their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), on the other
hand, whether or not currently due or payable, to be terminated by repayment,
capital contribution, distribution, forgiveness, or any combination of the
foregoing, at the Sellers sole and absolute discretion, and shall provide
written confirmation of such termination to Buyer; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such action shall adversely prejudice Buyer or any Acquired Company
or result in any liability or obligation of Buyer or any Acquired Company to
any other Person following the Closing.

 



26 SECTION 6.03 _Tax Matters_. (a) _Seller Tax Returns_. Seller shall
prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed, in a manner
consistent with past practice, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed
by the Acquired Companies with respect to all taxable periods of the Acquired
Companies ending prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall deliver any such Tax
Return to Buyer in the form proposed for filing at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the due date thereof and shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments provided by Buyer with respect thereto. For the avoidance
of doubt, any federal income Tax Return for the consolidated group that
includes Seller and the Acquired Companies for any taxable period shall not be
provided to Buyer. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, within the time and
in the manner required by applicable Law, all Seller Pre-Closing Taxes due
with respect to the Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Companies
with respect to all taxable periods of the Acquired Companies ending prior to
the Closing Date.

(b) _Buyer s Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare and timely file or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, in a manner consistent with past practice, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Companies with respect to a
Straddle Period of an Acquired Company. Buyer shall provide such Tax Returns
to Seller in the form proposed for filing at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the due date thereof and shall consider in good faith all reasonable
comments provided by Seller with respect thereto. Buyer shall not and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies after the
Closing) to amend any such Tax Return without Sellers prior written consent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject
to Section 6.03(c), Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, within the time and
in the manner required by applicable Law, all Taxes due with respect to Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Companies with respect to
Straddle Periods of the Acquired Companies.

 

(c) _Straddle Period_. Seller shall, at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the due date of any Tax Return that relates to a Straddle Period of an
Acquired Company, pay to Buyer any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return
that are Seller Pre-Closing Taxes. In the case of any Straddle Period of an
Acquired Company, the amount of any Taxes that are Seller Pre-Closing Taxes
shall be determined as follows: (i) Taxes other than Property Taxes shall be
allocated based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and (ii) Property Taxes
shall be allocated based on the ratio that the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date bears to the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period; _provided_ that any Taxes arising from or imposed with respect to any
action taken or transaction effected, in each case outside the ordinary course
of business, by Parent, Seller or any of the Acquired Companies on the Closing
Date prior to the Closing (other than any such action taken or transaction
effected by such party at the direction of Buyer) shall be Seller Pre-Closing
Taxes.

 

(d) _Tax Refunds_. Any refunds of Taxes (i) imposed on or for which Seller is
liable (including under this Agreement) or (ii) imposed on the Acquired
Companies with respect to (A) Pre-Closing Periods of the Acquired Companies or
(B) the portion of any Straddle Period of the Acquired Companies ending on or
before the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, shall, in each case,
be for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller the amount of
any such refund (including any interest received thereon), net of any costs,
within ten 

 



27  (10) days after such amount has been received; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller shall not be entitled to any such refund to the extent such refund was
taken into account as an asset in the determination of the final Closing Date
Net Working Capital.

(e) _Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by any Party, in connection with the preparation or filing of Tax Returns with
respect to the Acquired Companies and any Tax Contest or other proceeding
(each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to any Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period of the Acquired Companies. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon a Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
requesting Party shall reimburse the cooperating Parties for all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by such cooperating Parties.

(f)  _Transfer Taxes_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall be responsible for and
shall pay fifty percent of any Transfer Taxes imposed with respect to the sale
or transfer of the Interests to Buyer (and any indirect transfer of assets
held by the Acquired Companies that may be deemed to occur by reason of such
transfer of the Interests). All Tax Returns required to be filed to report any
Transfer Taxes imposed, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to the sale
or transfer of the Interests to Buyer shall be timely prepared and filed by
the Party responsible for such filing under applicable Law. The Party
preparing any such Tax Return shall provide such Tax Return to the other Party
in the form proposed for filing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
due date thereof and shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments
provided by such other Party with respect thereto.

(g) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parties agree that the purchase of the
Interests contemplated herein will be treated as a sale of the assets, and
assumption of the liabilities, of the Acquired Companies for federal income
Tax purposes. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller an allocation schedule setting forth Buyers
proposed allocation of the consideration among the assets of the Acquired
Companies that complies with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). If Seller objects
to the Allocation, then Seller shall provide Buyer written notice thereof
within thirty (30) days after receiving the Allocation. If the Parties are
unable to agree on any matter set forth in the Allocation, the Parties shall
refer such dispute to the Independent Accountants, which firm shall make a
final and binding determination as to the matters in dispute within thirty
(30) days following its appointment, and promptly shall notify the parties in
writing of its resolution. Any Allocation determined pursuant to the decision
of the Independent Accountants shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Each party shall be liable for and pay one-half of the fees and
other costs charged by the Independent Accountants. Seller and Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder following any adjustment to the allocable Purchase

their Affiliates to, report consistently with the Allocation (as finally
resolved pursuant to this subsection) in all Tax Returns, including

 



28  IRS Form 8594, which Seller and Buyer shall timely file with the IRS, and
none of the Parties shall take any position in any Tax Return that is
inconsistent with the Allocation (as finally resolved pursuant to this
subsection), as adjusted, in each case, except to the extent otherwise
required by a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code or
with the consent of the other Parties, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of Seller and Buyer
agrees to promptly advise the other regarding the existence of any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation related to the Allocation.

contrary, Seller, at its expense, shall have the right to conduct and control
the defense of any Tax Proceeding of an Acquired Company relating to any Pre-
Closing Period of such Acquired Company; _provided_ , that Seller shall not
take any action in connection with such Tax Proceeding if such action could
have an adverse effect on Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies after the Closing) that is material without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer, at its expense, shall have the right to
conduct and control the defense of any Tax Proceeding of an Acquired Company
relating to any Straddle Period of such Acquired Company, _provided_ , that to
the extent any such Tax Proceeding would have an adverse effect on Seller
that is material, Seller shall have the right to participate in the defense of
any such Tax Proceeding and Buyer shall not take any action in connection with
such Tax Proceeding if such action would have an adverse effect on Seller
that is material without the prior written consent of Seller, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(i) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax Sharing Agreements with respect to any
Acquired Company or to which any Acquired Company is a party shall be
terminated to the extent such Tax Sharing Agreement relates to any Acquired
Company as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and no Acquired
Company shall be bound thereby or have any obligation thereunder at any time
thereafter.

 

SECTION 6.04 _Confidentiality; Publicity_. (a) Each of Buyer, Seller, and
Parent acknowledges and agrees that the information being provided to it in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the terms and status thereof are subject to the terms
of a confidentiality agreement between Buyer and AES North
America Development, LLC dated August 29, 2011 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate as to Buyers obligations with respect to information
relating solely to the Acquired Companies or that otherwise constitutes
Acquired Companies Books and Records; _provided_ , _however_ , that any and
all other information protected from disclosure under the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain subject to the terms and conditions thereof after the
Closing Date. Parent and Seller will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, (i) use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be returned
or destroyed, as applicable, promptly after the date hereof all confidential
information provided or made available to any Person other than Buyer and the
person set forth on Section 6.04(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and
their respective Affiliates and representatives in connection with a potential
transaction relating to any of the Acquired Companies pursuant to the terms
and limitations of any confidentiality agreement with respect to such
Person, (ii) terminate all access for such Persons to the electronic dataroom
accessible through Intralinks with respect to the

 



29  Acquired Companies and (iii) not amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce, in
any material respect, any of the terms or conditions included in any
confidentiality agreements with respect to any of the Acquired Companies or
their business, provided that, Seller may, with Buyers consent, choose to
assign to Buyer such confidentiality agreements in lieu of taking any
enforcement action with respect thereto. Parent and Seller will, and will
cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to
cause to be returned or destroyed, as applicable, promptly after the date
hereof all confidential information solely relating to either of the Acquired
Companies that was provided or made available to the person set forth on
Section 6.04(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and its Affiliates and
representatives, pursuant to the terms and limitations of any confidentiality
agreement with respect to such Persons.

(b) Neither Parent, Seller nor Buyer, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
shall make any public announcement or issue any public communication
(including announcements or communications to Plant Employees and interviews
with the media) regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or any matter related to the foregoing, without first obtaining the
prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except if such announcement or other communication is required by
applicable Law or legal process (including rules of any national securities
exchange), in which case Parent, Seller and Buyer shall use their reasonable
best efforts to coordinate or communicate such announcement or communication
with the other party prior to announcement or issuance.

 

SECTION 6.05 _Acquired Companies Books and Records_. As of the Closing,
Parent, Seller and their Affiliates shall be entitled to retain copies (at
Parents and Sellers sole cost and expense) of any Acquired Companies Books
and Records in their possession pertaining to the ownership or operation of
the Acquired Companies; provided that Parent, Seller and their Affiliates
shall keep such Acquired Companies Books and Records confidential to the same
extent, and with the same degree of care, as its own books and records. Within
a reasonable period of time following the Closing (and reasonably
promptly following any request by Buyer for specific Acquired Companies Books
and Records), Parent and Seller shall deliver to Buyer the Acquired Companies
Books and Records. Where the Acquired Companies Books and Records (or other
books and records to be provided to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement) are
maintained, or the applicable data or information comprising or otherwise
necessary to such books and records is maintained, in electronic form pursuant
to software or systems that are not (or will not as of Closing be) owned or
licensed by one of the Acquired Companies, Seller and Parent shall provide
such books and records (or such supporting data and information), whether at
or after Closing, in an electronic format reasonably acceptable to Buyer and
Seller. Buyer shall, and to the extent within its powers as an equity holder,
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, retain, for at least seven (7) years
after the Closing Date, all Acquired Companies Books and Records in
the possession of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date or delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, except for tax returns and supporting
documentation relating to the Acquired Companies businesses or the Acquired
Companies assets which shall be retained until sixty (60) days after the
date required by applicable Law, and to make the same available after the
Closing Date for inspection and copying by Parent or Seller, at Parents or
Sellers expense, for purposes related to Parents or Sellers compliance
with law with respect to tax or regulatory matters or in connection with
matters that are the subject of indemnification under Section 9.01, during
regular business hours without significant disruption to the Acquired

 



30  Companies businesses and upon reasonable request and upon reasonable
advance notice; _provided_ , that during such period, Buyer may destroy or
dispose of any such books and records if it first offers in writing at least
sixty (60) days prior to such destruction or disposition to surrender such
books and records to Parent or Seller at Parents or Sellers expense. At and
after the expiration of such period, if Parent, Seller or any of their
Affiliates have previously requested in writing that such books and records be
preserved, Buyer shall, and to the extent within its powers as an equity
holder, shall cause the Acquired Companies to, either preserve such books and
records for such reasonable period as may be requested by Parent or Seller or
transfer such books and records to Parent or Seller or its designated
Affiliates, in each case at Parents or Sellers expense. Any books
and records provided to Parent or Seller pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall
be provided subject to the execution of a customary confidentiality agreement
with respect thereto.

 

SECTION 6.06 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Closing takes place, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the Party incurring such costs and expenses, including any fees,
expenses or other payments incurred or owed by a Party to any
brokers, financial or legal advisors or comparable other persons retained or
employed by such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

SECTION 6.07 _Employee Matters_.

(a) _Benefit Plans_. As of the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies shall
terminate their participation in each Benefit Plan that is not a Company Plan,
and in no event shall any Plant Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits
under such Benefit Plans with respect to services rendered or compensation
paid on or after the Closing Date. The Acquired Companies shall retain all
rights and obligations under each Company Plan on and after the Closing Date.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.07, from and
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause each relevant Acquired
Company to, honor, in accordance with its terms each (i) existing employment,
change in control, severance and termination protection plan, policy or
agreement of or between the Acquired Company and a Plant Employee that is
disclosed under Section 6.07(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and (ii) the
Collective Bargaining Agreement that is disclosed under Section 4.11(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(b) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits_. Except as otherwise provided
in an individual employment agreement, for a one (1) year period following
the Closing, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, compensation
(including salary, cash bonus, commissions, and other incentives) and benefits
to Continuing Employees (other than Continuing Union Employees) who remain
employed with Buyer and its Affiliates that are substantially similar to the
compensation and benefits provided to the Continuing Employees as of the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer shall, or shall cause
each Acquired Company (or an Affiliate thereof) to, provide each Continuing
Union Employee with compensation and benefits in accordance with the terms of
the Collective Bargaining Agreement covering such Continuing Union Employee
as applicable to such Continuing Union Employee from time to time. Without
limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.07, from and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall assume any and all obligation for and shall pay, or

 



31  cause an Acquired Company to assume any and all obligation for and pay, any
annual incentives or bonuses (whether the obligation for such annual
incentives or bonuses arises before, after or as a result of the Closing and
whether or not the obligation for such annual incentives or bonuses arises
under a Benefit Plan) payable to any Continuing Employee for the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent accrued on the books and
records of the Acquired Companies and reflected in Closing Date Net Working
Capital. Such annual incentives or bonuses shall be paid pursuant to the terms
of the incentive or bonus plans or arrangements maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates that cover the Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs. From and after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any responsibility for such payment
obligations, regardless of when such amounts were earned or accrued.

(c) _Severance and Paid Time Off_. Without limiting the foregoing provisions
of this Section 6.07, except as otherwise provided in an individual
employment or severance agreement, for a one (1) year period following the
Closing, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, severance and
paid time off benefits to each Continuing Employee (other than Continuing
Union Employees) that, respectively, are no less favorable than the severance
and paid time off benefits in effect in respect of similarly situated
employees of Buyer as in effect from time to time;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies (or an Affiliate
thereof) to, provide each Continuing Union Employee with severance and paid
time off benefits in accordance with the terms of the Collective Bargaining
Agreement covering such Continuing Union Employee as applicable to such
Continuing Union Employee from time to time. As of and after the Closing,
Buyer shall credit, or shall cause to be credited, each Continuing Employee
for all service with an Acquired Company (or any Affiliate) and any
respective predecessor entities, if any, for purposes of determining the right
to and the amount of severance and paid time off benefits after the Closing to
the extent such service was recognized for such purpose under the applicable
severance or paid time off benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
covering the Continuing Employee immediately before the Closing.

 

(d) _Benefit Continuation for Continuing Employees_. Buyer shall waive or
cause to be waived all limitations as to preexisting conditions or waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each Continuing Employee under any employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Buyer in which Continuing Employees participate (or are
eligible to participate) that are "welfare benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA). Buyer shall, or shall cause, each Continuing Employee
to be reimbursed for (i) any deductibles actually paid by such Continuing
Employees during the period commencing January 1, 2012 and ending immediately
prior to the Closing Date up to the maximum deductible that will be applicable
under the Buyer plan for such Continuing Employee, provided that each
Continuing Employee provides Buyer with proof of payment of such deductibles
in a form acceptable to Buyer prior to Buyer making such reimbursements, and
(ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the amount each Continuing Employee
contributed to his or her flexible spending reimbursement account under a
cafeteria plan qualified under Section 125 over (B) the amount applied to pay
approved medical expenses from that flexible spending reimbursement account
during the period beginning on January 1, 2012 and ending on the Closing
Date.

 



32 (e) _Service Credit for Continuing Employees_. Buyer shall provide, or cause
to be provided, to each Continuing Employee credit for all service prior to
the Closing Date, to the same extent as such service was credited under the
comparable Benefit Plan, under all Benefit Plans of Buyer for all purposes,
including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and
determination of level of benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
service shall not be recognized for purposes of benefit accrual or
determination of level of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan or
retiree welfare plan or to the extent that it results in the duplication of
benefits.

(f) _401(k) Plan_. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.07, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause each relevant
Acquired Company to, permit each Continuing Employee who satisfied the
eligibility requirements of the tax-qualified defined contribution plan with
a 401(k) feature in which the Continuing Employee participates immediately
before the Closing (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") to participate in a tax-
qualified defined contribution retirement plan with a 401(k) feature that is
applicable to employees of Buyer or its Affiliates immediately following the
Closing (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). Seller and Buyer shall take, cooperate
with, or cause to be taken, reasonable efforts to permit each Continuing
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) to the Buyer 401(k)
Plan in cash in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to
such Continuing Employee from the Seller 401(k) Plan (provided that such
contribution may be in the form of notes representing an employee loan under
the Seller 401(k) Plan to the extent such loan is not in default at the
time of the contribution to the Buyer 401(k) Plan, and Buyer shall take (or
cause to be taken) any and all action as may be required to provide that
Continuing Employees may continue to service any such loans through payroll
deductions after the Closing).

(g) _Responsibility for Welfare Plan Claims_. With respect to each Continuing
Employee (including any beneficiary or the dependent thereof), Seller shall
retain all liabilities and obligations for any medical, dental, health,
accident or disability claim to the extent that such liability or obligation
relates to claims incurred (whether or not reported or paid) prior to the
Closing Date and Buyer and its Affiliates shall be liable for any such claim
incurred on or following the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section
6.07(g), a claim shall be deemed to be incurred when (i) with respect to
medical, dental, health related benefits, accident and disability (including
workmens compensation benefits), the medical, dental, health related,
accident or disability services giving rise to such claim are performed and
(ii) with respect to life insurance, the death occurs.

(h) _Workforce Matters and Benefit Plan Liabilities_. Except with respect to
liabilities arising pursuant to a Company Plan, Seller and its Affiliates
shall be responsible for all liabilities relating to Plant Employees pursuant
to Benefit Plans. Seller shall indemnify, and keep indemnified, Buyer and its
Affiliates against all Controlled Group Liabilities and any liabilities
related to Benefit Plans required to be set forth on Section 4.11(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, other than Company Plans.

 

(i) _COBRA Liabilities_. Seller shall be responsible for providing notices and
coverage under COBRA to any Plant Employee (and his or her qualified
beneficiaries) as to whom a "qualifying event" (as defined in Section 4890B of
the Code) has occurred on or prior

 



33  to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for providing notices and
coverage under COBRA to any Plant Employee (and his or her qualified
beneficiaries) whose "qualifying event" occurs after the Closing Date.

(j) _WARN Act_. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible and assume all
liability for all notices or payments due to any Plant Employees (other than
Affected Employees) under the WARN Act, or to any Plant Employee (other than
any Affected Employee) who becomes entitled to notice as required under the
WARN Act and all notices, payments, fines or assessments due to any
Governmental Entity, pursuant to any applicable Law with respect to the
employment, discharge or layoff of employees by the Acquired Companies prior
to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible and assume all liability for
all notices or payments due to any Affected Employees under the WARN Act, or
to any Plant Employee who becomes entitled to receive notice as required under
the WARN Act on account of the aggregation of "employment losses" in
accordance with the WARN Act, and all notices, payments, fines or assessments
due to any Governmental Entity, pursuant to any applicable Law with respect to
the employment, discharge or layoff of employees by the Acquired Companies on
or after the Closing Date, including the WARN Act. Seller shall provide Buyer
with the information that Buyer reasonably deems necessary to determine its
obligations pursuant to the foregoing.

 

(k) _Collective Bargaining Agreement_. To the extent that there is a conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement, in each case solely as applicable to any
Continuing Union Employee, the terms of such Collective Bargaining Agreement
shall govern, and nothing herein shall result in any duplication of benefits
under this Agreement and such Collective Bargaining Agreement.

(l) _Third-Party Rights_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; (ii) shall alter or limit Sellers or Buyers
ability to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; or (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or former
employee any right to employment or continued employment for any period of
time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or
condition of employment.

SECTION 6.08 _Further Actions_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Buyer, Parent and Seller agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts (except where a different efforts standard is specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, in which case such different standard shall
apply) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the most
expeditious manner practicable.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Required Consents and other Consents
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, any Consents required in connection
with the Tolling Agreement, any Bond Consents, any approvals of parties to
Contracts with the

 



34  Acquired Companies, and any Filings or Consents with or from any
Governmental Entity, including by (i) preparing and filing as soon as
reasonably practicable all such Filings or Consents with or from any
Governmental Entity or other Person that are required to be filed or obtained
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) providing
information to Governmental Entities or other Persons as is necessary
to obtain all such Filings or Consents, (iii) taking all actions necessary to
cause all conditions set forth in Article 7 to be satisfied as soon as
practicable and (iv) executing and delivering any additional instruments
(which do not impose any material liability on Buyer, Parent, Seller or the
Acquired Companies) necessary to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be required to expend
any funds or assume Liabilities other than (x) customary filing fees and (y)
expenditures and liability assumptions which are customary and de minimis in
nature and amount in the context of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, prior to making any application or material written communication
to or filing with any Governmental Entity or other Person from whom a Required
Consent is sought in connection with this Agreement, each Party shall provide
the other Parties with drafts thereof and afford the other Parties a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts. The Parties agree to offer
the other Parties the opportunity to participate in all telephonic conferences
and all meetings with any Governmental Entity or other Person from whom a
Required Consent is sought to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Buyer, Parent, Seller or any of their
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall have any obligation to
(i) hold separate or divest any property or assets or (ii) agree to any
conduct restrictions relating to their respective businesses, in either case
which would result in the aggregate in a material adverse effect on the
Acquired Companies or on the Buyer (either of the foregoing, a " _Burdensome
Condition_ "). Buyer and Seller shall share equally the fees associated with
any Filings or Consents with or from any Governmental Entity or any Bond
Consents, in each case related to the transactions contemplated hereby
including without limitation the initial filing fee payable in respect of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

 

(c) Parent, Seller and Buyer shall (i) each promptly inform the other Party of
any material communication made to, or received by such Party from, any
Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or
requests for additional information and documentary material received
from any Governmental Entity and (iii) except as required by Law, not enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Entity agreeing not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Parent, Seller and Buyer shall not have any liability whatsoever to the
other Party arising out of or relating to (i) the failure to obtain any of
the Required Consents or any consent required to assign or transfer any
Contract set forth on Section 6.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or (ii)
any lawsuit, action, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by
or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain
any such Required Consent, in each case, so long as it has complied with the
applicable covenants contained in this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.09 _Names Following the Closing_. Within thirty (30) days following
Closing, Buyer shall (i) cause the Acquired Companies to cease using the name
"AES" and any

 



35  word or expression similar thereto or constituting an abbreviation or
extension thereof (" _Seller s Marks_"), (ii) remove the Sellers Marks from
the properties and assets of the Acquired Companies, and (iii) notify Seller
of the new name and contact information for the Acquired Companies. After such
time, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, use the
Sellers Marks or any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or
any Affiliate thereof, and Buyer acknowledges that it, its Affiliates and the
Acquired Companies have no rights whatsoever to use the Sellers Marks or such
logos, trademarks or trade names or related intellectual property.
Notwithstanding Buyers right to use the Sellers Marks for the time periods
set forth above, Buyer agrees that (a) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date) shall be deemed an
agent, representative or joint venture partner of Seller; (b) Seller and their
Affiliates shall retain sole and exclusive ownership of the Sellers Marks,
and all goodwill and rights related thereto; and (c) Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date) shall not knowingly
take any action in respect of Sellers Marks that would adversely affect
Seller or their Affiliates, or the interest of Seller or their Affiliates in
the Sellers Marks.

SECTION 6.10 _Post-Closing Cooperation_. After Closing, upon prior reasonable
written request, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with each other in furnishing records, information, oral or written
testimony, oral or written attestations and certifications, and other
assistance in connection with transition matters and any inquiries or
proceedings involving the Acquired Companies, but excluding any proceedings
arising from disputes among the Parties. Each such requesting Party shall
reimburse such cooperating Party for any reasonable expenses incurred by such
cooperating Party as a result of any such requested cooperation.

SECTION 6.11  _Transition Services_. Following the Closing Date, for a period
to be mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller (such period not to exceed five (5)
months), Parent and Seller shall continue to cooperate with Buyer and assist
in the transition of the businesses of the Acquired Companies to Buyer by
providing, or causing to be provided, to Buyer, if requested by Buyer,
customary transition services, the scope of which, and the compensation to be
provided in respect of which, shall be mutually reasonably agreed by Buyer
and Seller.

SECTION 6.12 _Insurance_. With respect to events or circumstances relating to
the Acquired Companies that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date
that are covered by the insurance policies of Parent or Seller or any of their
subsidiaries (the " _Pre-Closing Insurance_ "), the Acquired Companies may
make claims under such policies and programs to the extent such policies and
programs are available and cover claims of the Acquired Companies and Parent
and Seller shall take such actions as may reasonably be requested by Buyer in
connection with the tendering of such claims to the applicable insurers under
such Pre-Closing Insurance and to provide Buyer with the net proceeds it
realizes with respect to such claims; _provided_ , _however_ that (i) Buyer
and its subsidiaries shall be liable for all uninsured or uncovered amounts
for such claims, and (ii) Buyer shall notify Seller of all such coverage
claims made. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Seller shall retain all
rights to control their insurance policies and programs, including the right
to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes
with respect to any of its insurance policies and programs, notwithstanding
whether any such policies or programs apply to any liabilities of Buyer
and its subsidiaries; _provided_ that neither Parent nor Seller shall take
any action or omit to take any action for the purpose of limiting the

 



36  Acquired Companies ability to make all claims and recover proceeds in
respect thereof. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall be solely responsible
for providing insurance to the Acquired Companies for events or circumstances
relating to the Acquired Companies that occur or exist from and after the
Closing Date.

 

SECTION 6.13 _Seller Contracts; Transfer of Assets_.

(a) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to assign and transfer to
Ironwood LLC, and cause Ironwood LLC to assume and accept, the Contract set
forth on Section 6.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Section 6.13
Contract_ ") prior to the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Seller
is unable to effect such assignment, transfer, assumption and acceptance prior
to the Closing, Seller shall, immediately following the Closing, deliver a
notice of termination in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the
Section 6.13 Contract and otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to
terminate the Section 6.13 Contract as promptly as practicable. Parent and
Seller shall pay all fees, costs and expenses due in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms of the Section 6.13 Contract in connection with such
termination and with respect to the period after the delivery of the notice
of termination and on or prior to the effectiveness of such termination;
_provided_ that Buyer shall promptly reimburse Parent and Seller for 75% of
such fees, costs and expenses upon presentation of reasonable documentation of
such payment.

(b) To the extent that any Affiliate of either Acquired Company (other than
the Acquired Companies themselves) holds at or prior to the Closing any
asset, property or right that is used primarily in the business of the
Acquired Companies, Parent shall cause such Person to promptly transfer such
asset, property or right to the Acquired Companies.

 

SECTION 6.14 _Financial Statements_. Seller shall deliver to Buyer, no later
than April 25, 2012, audited financial statements of Ironwood LLC for the
year ended December 31, 2011, that comply with the requirements for financial
reports that must be furnished to the Senior Parties (as defined in the
Indenture) under the Indenture. Unless Seller provides the
unaudited financial statements and related certification related to any
quarter to the Senior Parties as required by the Indenture prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, no later than 45 days following
the end of (i) the first quarter of 2012 and (ii) any other quarter that ends
prior to the Closing Date, unaudited financial statements of Ironwood LLC for
each such quarter, together with a written statement that to Parents and
Sellers Knowledge such unaudited financial statements fairly present in all
material respects Ironwood LLCs financial condition and results of operations
in accordance with GAAP at and as of their respective dates (" _Seller s
Certification_"), provided, however, that Buyer shall provide Seller with any
information that Seller reasonably requires in order to prepare and deliver
Sellers Certification. As part of the transition services contemplated by
Section 6.11, Seller shall provide such reasonable assistance to Ironwood
LLC, at Buyers expense, in connection with any audit of Ironwood LLCs
financial statements for any period commencing on or after January 1, 2012 and
occurring in whole or in part prior to Closing as may be requested by Buyer.
Such assistance shall be limited to providing such information as Ironwood LLC
and its independent audit firm may reasonably request with respect to books,
records and other financial data of Ironwood LLC for the period under audit
and, if applicable, internal controls that may have been in effect at Ironwood
LLC during the period under audit, as well as any other information that
Ironwood LLC and its independent audit 

 



37  firm may reasonably request. Seller shall also provide any representations
reasonably requested by Buyers independent audit firm relating to any
information provided by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations
of Seller under this Section 6.14 shall survive the Closing and the services
provided under this Section 6.14 shall in no way limit the accounting and
related services that will be provided to Buyer, if requested by Buyer, in
accordance with Section 6.11.

Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect), except to the
extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
date (in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date)
and except for such breaches that, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) Parent and Seller shall each have delivered to Buyer a certificate, dated
as of the Closing Date, executed on behalf of each of Parent and Seller by an
authorized executive officer thereof, certifying that the conditions specified

express qualifier therein as to materiality), except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which
case as of such earlier date) and except for such breaches that would in the
aggregate not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on
Buyers ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

(c) Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a certificate, dated as of the
Closing Date, executed on behalf of Buyer by an authorized individual

40 ARTICLE 9

_Indemnification and Termination_

SECTION 9.01 _Indemnification by Parent and Seller_. (a) From and after the
Closing, subject to the other provisions of this Article 9, Parent and Seller
agree to indemnify Buyer and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Buyer
Entities_ ") and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all
Indemnifiable Losses suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified Buyer
Entity in connection with, arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of
any of the representations and warranties made by Parent or Seller to Buyer in
Articles 3 and 4 (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), in each case
when made and, except for representations and warranties that speak of a
specific date and time, on and as of the Closing Date as though made on the
Closing Date ( _provided_ , that solely with respect to the calculation of
damages with respect to such breach, any express qualifier therein as to
materiality, Seller Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect
shall be disregarded), (ii) any breach by Parent or Seller of any of their
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or (iii) any
Excluded Taxes.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, the
Indemnified Buyer Entities shall be entitled to indemnification with respect
to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(i), other than
(x) claims for Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or resulting from any
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.06(b) and
(c) to the extent based on liabilities or expenses of Prescott LLC not
relating to or arising from the business of Ironwood LLC (an " _Additional
Liability Claim_ ") or (y) claims in respect of any Specified
Representations:

(i) only if, and then only to the extent that, the aggregate
Indemnifiable Losses to all Indemnified Buyer Entities with respect to all
such claims exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), whereupon (subject to
the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) below) Parent or Seller shall be
obligated to pay in full all such amounts but only to the extent such
aggregate Indemnifiable Losses are in excess of the amount of the Deductible;

(ii) only with respect to individual items where the Indemnifiable Losses
relating thereto are in excess of $75,000 (any items less than such threshold
shall not be aggregated for the purposes of the immediately preceding clause
(i)); and

(iii) only with respect to such claims made on or before the expiration of
the survival period pursuant to Section 8.01 for the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Indemnified Buyer Entities be entitled to aggregate
indemnification with respect to claims pursuant to Sections 9.01(a)(i) and
(ii) (but only, in the case of Section

 



41  9.01(a)(ii), with respect to breaches of Section 6.02 that are not knowing
and willful) in excess of 20% of the Base Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ , that the Cap applicable to the aggregate indemnification
obligations of Parent and Seller related to (A) the Specified Representations
made by Seller, (B) claims pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(ii) (except for claims
with respect to Section 6.02 that are subject to the Cap as set forth above)
or (C) an Additional Liability Claim shall be the Purchase Price.

(d) In no event shall Parent or Seller be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Buyer Entities with respect to Indemnifiable Losses to the extent
arising from any material breach of this Agreement by any of the Indemnified
Buyer Entities.

(e) This Section is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.03(b). 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
limitations contained in Section 9.01(b) and (c) shall not apply with respect
to indemnification for Excluded Taxes and any breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.13(a)(vii) and 4.13(d)
(and related costs and expenses).

 

SECTION 9.02 _Indemnification by Buyer_. (a) From and after the Closing Date,
subject to the other provisions of this Article 9, Buyer agrees to indemnify
Parent, Seller and their respective officers, directors, employees and
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Indemnified Seller Entities_ ") and to hold
each of them harmless from and against, any and all Indemnifiable Losses
suffered, paid or incurred by any such Indemnified Seller Entity in connection
with, arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by Buyer to Parent or Seller in Article 5
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), in each case when made and,
except for representations and warranties that speak of a specific date and
time, on and as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (
_provided_ , that solely with respect to the calculation of damages with
respect to such breach, any express qualifier therein as to materiality or
Buyer Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded), or (ii) any breach by
Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Indemnified Seller Entities be entitled to (i) aggregate
indemnification with respect to claims pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) in
excess of the Cap; _provided_ , that the Cap applicable to any indemnification
obligation of Buyer related to either the Specified Representations made by
Buyer or claims pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(ii) shall be the Purchase Price or
(ii) indemnification with respect to claims made after the expiration of the
survival period pursuant to Section 8.01 for the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

(c) In no event shall Buyer be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Seller
Entities with respect to Indemnifiable Losses to the extent arising from any
material breach of any of the Indemnified Seller Entities.

 

(d) This Section is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.03(b).

 

SECTION 9.03 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) If an Indemnified Buyer Entity
or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each, an " _Indemnified Entity_ ") believes
that a claim, demand or other

 



42  circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Article 9 (whether or not the
amount of Indemnifiable Losses relating thereto is then quantifiable), such
Indemnified Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving
written notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from which
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Entity_ ") as promptly as
practicable; _provided_ that the failure to give a Claim Notice (or delay in
giving a Claim Notice) shall not affect the Indemnified Entitys right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the delay actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Entity. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim
in reasonable detail.

(b) Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Entity of a Claim Notice in respect of an
action or claim of a Person not a Party or affiliated with any such Party (a "
_Third Party_ "), the Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to (i) assume and
have sole control over the defense of such action or claim at its sole cost
and expense and with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Entity
if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Entity within
thirty (30) days of the receipt of such Claim Notice from the Indemnified
Entity; _provided_ , that (x) if the actual or potential defendants in, or
targets of, such action or claim include both an Indemnifying Entity and an
Indemnified Entity, and the Indemnified Entity shall have reasonably
concluded that there are or are reasonably likely to be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Entity or that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist
a conflict of interest, in either case that would make it inappropriate in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Entity for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Entity and the Indemnifying Entity, then
the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such action or claim and (y) the Indemnifying Entitys retention of counsel
shall be subject to the written consent of the Indemnified Entity if such
counsel otherwise creates a conflict of interest under applicable standards
of professional conduct or an unreasonable risk of disclosure of confidential
information concerning an Indemnified Entity, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; and (ii) negotiate a
settlement or compromise of such action or claim; provided, that (x) such
settlement or compromise shall include a full and unconditional waiver and
release by the Third Party of all Indemnified Entities (without any cost,
liability or admission of wrongdoing of any nature whatsoever to or by such
Indemnified Entities) and (y) any such settlement or compromise shall be
permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the Indemnified
Entity, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If,
within thirty (30) days of receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim
Notice with respect to a Third Party action or claim, the Indemnifying Entity
(i) advises such Indemnified Entity in writing that the Indemnifying Entity
elects not to defend, settle or compromise such action or claim or (ii) fails
to make such an election in writing, such Indemnified Entity may, at its
option, defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay such action or claim;
_provided_ , that any such settlement or compromise shall be permitted
hereunder only with the written consent of the Indemnifying Entity, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Unless
and until the Indemnifying Entity makes an election in accordance with this
Section 9.03(b) to defend, settle or compromise such action or claim, all of
the Indemnified Entitys reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the
defense, settlement or compromise of any such action or claim shall be
Indemnifiable Losses subject to indemnification hereunder to the extent
provided herein and, if applicable, to the extent such expenses exceed the
Deductible or in the event the Deductible has been satisfied, shall be borne
by the Indemnifying Entity and payable monthly or as legal bills are received
by the Indemnified Entity and tendered to the Indemnifying Entity. 

 



43  Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the Indemnifying Entity all
information that is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Entity and
reasonably available to such Indemnified Entity relating to such action or
claim, except as may be prohibited by applicable Law or as would compromise
any applicable attorney/client privilege. In addition, the Parties shall
render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such action or claim. The
Party in charge of the defense shall keep the other Parties fully apprised at
all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with
respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Entity elects to defend any such action
or claim, then the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to participate in such
defense with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Entity, at such
Indemnified Entitys sole cost and expense. In the event the Indemnifying
Entity assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or settle or
compromise) any action or claim as described above, the Indemnified Entity
shall reimburse the Indemnifying Entity for all costs and expenses incurred
by the Indemnifying Entity in connection with such defense (or negotiation,
settlement or compromise) to the extent, if applicable, that such costs and
expenses do not exceed the amount of the remaining Deductible, and any
amounts so reimbursed shall be applied against the amount of any remaining
Deductible.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.03 to the contrary, except as
provided in Section 6.03(h), none of the Parent, Seller or Buyer shall have
the right to control or participate in any proceeding relating to Taxes
imposed on another Party.

SECTION 9.04 _Indemnification Generally_. (a) Each Indemnified Entity shall be
obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification under this Article
9 to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds
available to such Indemnified Entity with regard to the applicable claims and
to recover any amounts to which it may be entitled in respect of the
applicable claims pursuant to contractual or other indemnification rights that
it may have against Third Parties. The amount which the Indemnifying Entity is
or may be required to pay to any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this Article
9 with respect to any Indemnifiable Loss shall be (i) reduced (retroactively,
if necessary) by any net insurance proceeds or other amounts actually
recovered from a Third Party by or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity
in mitigation of, or related to, the related Indemnifiable Losses and (ii)
(A) increased to take into account any additional Tax cost to the Indemnified
Entity arising from the receipt of indemnification payments with respect to
such Indemnifiable Loss and (B) decreased to take into account any Tax
benefit to the Indemnified Entity with respect to such Indemnifiable Loss;
_provided_ , that the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit shall be the
net present value of such Tax cost or Tax benefit as reasonably determined by
the parties at the time the indemnification payment is made. If an Indemnified
Entity shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from the
Indemnifying Entity in respect of Indemnifiable Losses (including any
Purchase Price adjustment with respect to the circumstances giving rise to
such payment under this Article 9) and shall subsequently receive net
insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses,
then such Indemnified Entity shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Entity a
sum equal to the amount of such net insurance proceeds or other amounts
actually received; _provided_ , _however_ , that any indemnity payment under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for
income Tax purposes (except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code).

 



44 (b) In addition to the requirements of Section 9.04(a), each Indemnified
Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification
under this Article 9 to use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
Indemnifiable Losses upon and after becoming aware of any such Indemnifiable
Losses.

 

(c) The indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be the exclusive
post-Closing remedy available to any Party hereto with respect to any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except in the case of fraud. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from,
fraud) it may have against the other Parties arising under or based upon this
Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any
applicable Law (including any relating to environmental matters) or otherwise,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 9.

 

SECTION 9.05 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

 

(a) at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual written agreement of Buyer
and Seller;

 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date hereof (the "
_Outside Date_ "); provided that if on the Outside Date the condition to
Closing set forth in Section 7.01(a) shall not have been satisfied, but all
other conditions to the Closing shall have been satisfied or waived (or shall
be capable of being satisfied at the Closing), then either Buyer or Seller may
extend the Outside Date by an additional sixty (60) days; provided further,
that, in the event all Required Consents from a Governmental Entity required
to be obtained under Section 7.01(a) shall have been obtained but one or more
of such Required Consents shall not yet have become a Final Order due to a
pending request for stay, reconsideration or rehearing, application or request
for review, notice of appeal or other judicial petition or review, the
Outside Date shall be automatically extended until the earlier of (i) the day
that any such Required Consent is stayed, withdrawn, revoked or reversed
without further opportunity for rehearing, review or appeal, and (ii) five
(5) Business Days after all such Required Consents shall have become Final
Orders, but in neither of cases (i) or (ii) shall the Outside Date be extended
by more than sixty (60) days (in addition to the initial sixty (60) day
period specified above) unless all Required Consents shall have become Final
Orders by such sixtieth (60th) day; and provided further, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.05(b) shall not be available to
any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such date; or 

(c) by either Buyer or Seller by giving written notice to the other Party if
any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken
any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and such order, decree, ruling or other Action shall not be subject to appeal
or shall have become final and unappealable; or

 



45 (d) by Seller if Buyer has breached any representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements made by it in this Agreement or any representation or warranty
made by it shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such
that the condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) would not be
satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, has not
been cured prior to the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after written notice
thereof is given by Seller to Buyer and (y) the Outside Date; provided
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.05(d) shall not be available to Seller if it is then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or
7.02(b) not to be satisfied; or

 

(e) by Buyer if Seller or Parent has breached any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements made by either of them in this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made by either of them shall have become untrue
after the date of this Agreement, such that the condition set forth in Section
7.02(a) or 7.02(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not
curable or, if curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) thirty
(30) days after written notice thereof is given by Buyer to Seller and (y) the
Outside Date; provided however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.05(e) shall not be available to Buyer if it is then in
breach of this Agreement so as to cause the condition set forth in Section
7.03(a) or 7.03(b) not to be satisfied.

 

SECTION 9.06 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 9.05, such
termination shall be without liability of any Party to the other Parties,
except liability for any breach of any representations, warranties, covenants
or other agreements under this Agreement prior to such termination.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by either Party pursuant to Section 9.05,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without
further action by any Party,  _provided_ , that Buyer shall (i) at Buyers
election either return all documents and other material received from Seller,
their Affiliates or their advisors or representatives relating to the Acquired
Companies and transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether so
obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement, to Seller, or
destroy all copies of the foregoing documents and materials, and deliver a
certificate to Seller confirming such destruction; and (ii) continue to treat
all confidential information received by Buyer and its Affiliates and their
Representatives with respect to the Acquired Companies in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the termination hereof.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated, this Agreement shall become null
and void and of no further force and effect, except for the following
provisions which shall survive such termination: Section 6.04
(Confidentiality; Publicity); Section 6.06 (Expenses); Section 9.05
(Termination); this Section 9.06 (Effect of Termination); and Article 10
(Miscellaneous).

SECTION 10.12 _Guarantee_.

and not as surety, to Seller and its Affiliates and successors thereof, the
due and punctual payment and performance of all obligations of Buyer under
this Agreement (the guaranty obligations under this Section 10.12,
collectively, the " _Guarantied Obligations_ "). For the sake of clarity,
Guarantor shall not be obligated by reason of this Section 10.12 to itself
directly perform any Guarantied Obligations to the extent it shall have caused
such obligations to be performed.

 

(b) Guarantor guarantees that the Guarantied Obligations will be duly and
punctually paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If for any
reason Buyer shall fail or be unable duly and punctually to pay or fully and
completely to perform any Guarantied Obligation as and when the same shall
become due or otherwise required, then Guarantor shall, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, forthwith duly and punctually pay or fully
and completely perform or cause to be fully and completely performed such
Guarantied Obligation. Guarantor further agrees that this Agreement, to the
extent it requires the payment

 



50  of money, constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of collection
and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from
Buyer. Guarantors liability under this Agreement shall be absolute,
unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective, without limitation,
of:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a result of
the application of any bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar
Laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity to Buyer;

(ii) any modification, amendment, consent, extension, forbearance or waiver
of or any consent to departure from this Agreement that may be agreed to by
Buyer;

(iii) any action or inaction by Seller under or in respect of this Agreement,
or any failure, lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part of Seller to
enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred on Seller in
this Agreement;

 

(iv) any merger or consolidation of the Parties or any other Person into or
with any Person, or any sale, lease or transfer of any of the assets of the
Parties or any other Person to any other Person;

(v) any change in the ownership of any of the Parties or any Person; or

(vi) any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event, whether similar
or dissimilar to the foregoing and whether foreseen or unforeseen, which
otherwise might constitute a legal or equitable defense or discharge of the
liabilities of a guarantor or surety or which otherwise might limit
recourse against Guarantor or any other Person;

_provided_ , _however_ , that in any event Guarantor shall in all events have
the benefit of any rights (including any defenses) to which Buyer would be
entitled in respect of the Guarantied Obligations.

(c) Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives (i) any and all notices,
including promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this Agreement and
any other notice with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and this
Agreement, (ii) any presentment, demand, performance, protest, notice of
nonpayment as the same pertains to Buyer, suit or the taking of other action
by Seller against, and any other notice to, Buyer, Guarantor or others with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (iii) any right to require
Seller to proceed against Buyer or to exhaust any security held by Seller or
to pursue any other remedy with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations,
(iv) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Seller, unless the
same would excuse performance by Buyer under this Agreement with respect to
any of the Guarantied Obligations and (v) any duty of Seller to advise
Guarantor of any information known to Seller regarding Buyer or its ability
to perform under this Agreement with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations. Seller may at any time, and from time to time, without notice to,
or consent of, Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder, with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (1)
agree with Buyer to make any change in the terms of the Guarantied
Obligations, (2) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against Buyer
or others, or (3) compromise or subordinate the Guarantied

 



51  Obligations, including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses
are hereby waived by Guarantor with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations (other than fraud or willful misconduct by Seller or defenses to
payment of the obligations under this Agreement, each of the foregoing
defenses being retained by Guarantor).

(d) The provisions of this Section 10.12 shall terminate upon the final
determination of the Purchase Price and satisfaction or performance of any
payment by Buyer required by Sections 2.01(c) and 2.03(c); provided that the
provisions of this Section 10.12 shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if (i) at any time and to the extent that any
payment of the amounts required by Sections 2.01(c) and 2.03(c) is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by the payee thereof upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of Buyer or Guarantor, all as
though such payment had not been made, or (ii) the obligations of Guarantor
under this Section 10.12 with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations
are released in consideration of a payment of money or transfer of property by
Buyer or any other Person and to the extent that such payment, transfer or
grant is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the recipient thereof
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of Buyer,
Guarantor or such other Person, all as though such payment, transfer or grant
had not been made.
