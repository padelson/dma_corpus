The Company represents and warrants that _Schedule 1.6(c)_ (i) correctly and accurately sets forth the amount of the Closing Founder Loan Cash due as of the dates set forth therein, and the holders thereof, and (ii) as amended prior to the Closing, will correctly and accurately set forth the amount due under all Closing Founder Loan Cash and Interim Company Indebtedness as of the Closing Date, and the holders thereof; and

 (a) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. 

    

 (i) Each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Preferred Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive, promptly after the Effective Time, an amount equal to the Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference. The payment of the Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference shall be made (1) in accordance with the Companys certificate of incorporation, and (2) first from the Closing Cash, until the Closing Cash is exhausted, and if the amount of the Closing Cash is insufficient to pay the Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference in full, from the Closing Shares, and then any other shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable to the holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement, for such Company Capital Stock, at the time and only to the extent that such shares would otherwise be payable pursuant to the terms hereof. In the event that any portion of the Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference is required to be paid in shares of Parent Common Stock, such shares shall be paid based on a per share valuation equal to the Calculated Stock Price. 

   

 (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive, (A) promptly after the Effective Time, (1) an amount in cash equal to the Closing Cash Ratio, _plus_ (2) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Closing Stock Ratio, _plus_ (B) upon each Escrow Payment, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (if any) equal to the Escrow Stock Ratio for such Escrow Payment, if and when payable pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Escrow Agreement, _plus_ (C) upon any distribution of Earn Out Shares, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the applicable Earn Out Exchange Ratio for such distribution, if and when payable under  _Section 1.11(a)(ii)_ and _Section 1.15_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or the Company or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and extinguished without any (i) conversion thereof or (ii) further action on the part of Parent or the Company or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company. 

   

 (c) _Membership Interests of Merger Sub_. All of the membership interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for validly issued and fully paid membership interests of the Surviving Company. 

   

 (d) _Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company Stock Plans_. All unexpired and unexercised Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, and all unvested Company Restricted Stock as of the Effective Time, together with the Company Stock Plans, shall be assumed by Parent as follows: 

    

 (i) (A) Subject to cancellation of Non-Continuing Options pursuant to clause (ii) below, each unexpired and unexercised Company Option (other than Non-Continuing Options), whether vested or unvested, shall be, in connection with the Merger, assumed by Parent, together with the Company Stock Plans. 

   

 (B) Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement (a "Substituted Parent Option") shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), provided that upon exercise, the holder of any portion or all of a Company Option (a "Company Option Portion") shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such Company Option Portion immediately prior to the Effective Time had such Company Option Portion been fully vested at such time, promptly after exercise, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Closing Stock Ratio (provided that no such exercise shall be for less than ten shares of Parent Common Stock (or all of the Substituted Parent Option, if less than ten shares of Parent Common Stock are issuable upon exercise of the Substituted Parent Option). For the avoidance of doubt, after the Effective Time, the aggregate exercise price of each such Substituted Parent Option, assuming full vesting thereof, shall remain the same as it would have been for the corresponding Company Option, again assuming full vesting thereof, immediately before the Effective Time, such that the exercise price of any portion or all of a Substituted Parent Option shall continue to be determined based on the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of the corresponding Company Option Portion, assuming full vesting of such corresponding Company Option Portion, immediately prior to the Effective Time and the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the corresponding Company Option Portion immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (C) In addition, each holder of a Substituted Parent Option shall be entitled to receive the following payments in respect of each share of Company Common Stock that was issuable upon exercise of the related Company Option (whether or not vested at such time), immediately prior to the Effective Time: (1) the amount of cash equal to the Closing Cash Ratio (the "Option Cash"), to be paid upon the later of (U) the vesting of such Substituted Parent Option (or relevant portion thereof) and (V) the time at which any holder of Company Common Stock receives Closing Cash (if any) pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)(ii)_ ; (2) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (if any) equal to the Escrow Stock Ratio for each Escrow Payment, if payable pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Escrow Agreement, such shares to be paid upon the later of (W) the vesting of such Substituted Parent Option (or relevant portion thereof), and (X) the date of such Escrow Payment to the former holders of Company Common Stock; and (3) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the applicable Earn Out Exchange Ratio for each distribution of Earn Out Shares if payable under _Section 1.11(a)(ii)_ and  _Section 1.15_, such shares to be paid upon the later of (Y) the vesting of such Substituted Parent Option (or relevant portion thereof), and (Z) the applicable Earn Out Delivery Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise or termination of any vested Substituted Parent Option (including one that vests on a termination of employment) shall not affect the Substituted Parent Optionholders rights to the payments described in this paragraph. The applicable payment date in clauses (U), (V), (W), (X), (Y) and (Z), hereof shall be determined independently with respect to the vested and unvested portions of each Unvested Substituted Parent Option as of such date of determination. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Unvested Substituted Parent Option does not vest, then the holder thereof shall not be entitled to any payment under this _Section 1.7(d)(i)(C)_ with respect to such Unvested Substituted Parent Option, and to the extent that any Company Option is vested as of the Effective Time, an equal portion of the Substituted Parent Option shall for purposes of this Agreement be deemed vested as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (ii) No Non-Continuing Options will be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger or otherwise. The Company may in its discretion accelerate the vesting of unvested or unexercisable Company Options that are Non-Continuing Options prior to the Effective Time and shall terminate, or cause or allow to be terminated or to be forfeited, all Non-Continuing Options, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, such that no Non-Continuing Options are outstanding at the Effective Time. 

   

 (iii) All of the Company repurchase rights and purchase options, under any stock option agreements, buy-back agreements, and supplemental agreements entered into pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the other agreements listed on _Schedule 1.7(d)(iii)_ that are outstanding as of the date hereof shall terminate, and the repurchase rights and other restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock shall lapse, as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (iv) Except as provided in this _Section 1.7(d)_, any and all restrictions on the Company Options granted under the Company Stock Plans and related agreements, and the Company Common Stock issued pursuant to such 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Options or pursuant to any such other agreements that do not lapse
in accordance with their terms (as in effect at the Effective Time) shall
continue in full force and effect until such restrictions lapse pursuant to
the terms of such Company Stock Plans and agreements, and any repurchase
rights or repurchase options that the Company has with respect to such
Company Options shall also continue in full force and effect with respect to
the Substituted Parent Options until such rights or options lapse in
accordance with their terms. 

   

 (v) Each of the Company and Parent shall take commercially reasonable actions necessary or advisable to cause all Company Options to remain unchanged, except for (A) the conversion of Company Options as set forth in _Section 1.7(d)(i)_ as a result of the Merger, and (B) in the case of Non-Continuing Options, (X) the cancellation, expiration, forfeiture or termination thereof; each as provided for in this _Section 1.7(d)_ prior to the Effective Time, (Y) the acceleration of vesting of Non-Continuing Options at the election of the Company prior to the Effective Time, or (Z) such other changes as are approved by the Company and Parent in writing after the date hereof. 

   

 (vi) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any or all payments to be made to holders of Company Options under the terms hereof, may, at the election of Parent, be paid by the Surviving Company or Parent, or any designated agent thereof, and shall not be required to be paid by any exchange agent or paying agent or other agent designated hereunder to make payments to the Company Stockholders. Any such election shall automatically impose upon Parent the obligation to make, or cause the Surviving Company to make, such payments. 

   

 (vii) In the event that at any time after the Effective Time Parent or the Surviving Company terminates without Cause the employment of, or causes the termination of employment with Good Reason of, any holder of an Unvested Substituted Parent Option as of such date (a "Terminated Company Employee"), effective upon the date of termination of employment of such Terminated Company Employee, the Unvested Substituted Parent Options held by such Terminated Company Employee shall vest and such Unvested Substituted Parent Option shall become fully exercisable upon such termination, subject to the terms thereof, and such Terminated Company Employee shall have until the earlier of (X) 30 days from and after the date that Parent notifies such Terminated Company Employee of the ability to exercise such Unvested Substituted Parent Option in full and (Y) the expiration date of such Substituted Parent Option, to exercise such Substituted Parent Option. 

  

 (e) _Reservation of Shares_. Parent has reserved or will reserve sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_. 

   

 (f) _Restrictions on Closing Shares_. Until December 31, 2010, none of the Closing Shares issued by Parent to the Founders prior to December 31, 2010 shall be, directly or indirectly, transferred, sold, exchanged, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, gifted or otherwise 

      ##### 

  

    

disposed of, and the Founders will not enter into any swap, hedge or other
arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of such Closing Shares, whether any such
transaction is to be settled by delivery of such Parent Common Stock or other
securities, in cash or otherwise. In furtherance of such restrictions, Parent
shall be entitled (i) to issue stop transfer instructions to its transfer
agent with respect to such shares if any Founder attempts to transfer such
shares in violation of the provisions hereof, and (ii) to place restrictive
legends reflecting such restrictions on any certificates or other evidences
of ownership of such shares. Notwithstanding the provisions of ARTICLE V,
Section 4 of the Companys certificate of incorporation providing that the
Drag Along Stockholders shall be subject to the same representations,
warranties, covenants, indemnities, and agreements made by the Founders,
the restrictions set forth herein relating to the Closing Shares of the
Founders shall apply to only fifty percent of the Closing Shares and the
Option Shares issued to each Eligible Securityholder other than the
Founders. 

   

 1.8 _Adjustments to Earn Out Shares and Rights to Receive Parent Common Stock_. The Earn Out Shares, the First Earn Out Shares, the Second Earn Out Shares and the Total Closing Shares, and any other share numbers or ratios hereunder shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary, if any, to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock), reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock the effective date of which occurs after the date hereof and on or before the Effective Time (or on or before the date of payment of the applicable Milestone with respect to the Earn Out Shares). 

  

 1.9 _Fractional Shares; Book Entry Form_. 

  

 (a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, and in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Option that would otherwise be entitled, whether as of the Closing Date, Escrow Payment Date or any Earn Out Delivery Date, to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder on such date) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Calculated Stock Price. 

   

 (b) The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting part of the Merger consideration, at Parents option, may be issued in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Option or is otherwise required under applicable Law. 

   

 1.10 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_) by a holder that has (i) demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL, and that, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters rights or (ii) to the extent applicable, such shares are dissenting 

      ##### 

  

    

shares under the CGCL for which the holder has properly demanded payment for
such shares at their fair market value in accordance with Chapter 13 of the
CGCL (such shares in clauses (i) and (ii), each, "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into or represent a right to receive cash or Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 1.7_, but the holder thereof shall only
be entitled to such rights as are granted by the DGCL or the CGCL, as
applicable. If, after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock that demands appraisal of such shares under the DGCL or payment
for such shares at their fair market value under the CGCL shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to such
appraisal or payment, then, upon the occurrence of such event, such holders
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive the consideration otherwise payable with respect to such Company
Capital Stock as provided in _Section 1.7_, without interest thereon, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of the certificate representing such shares in
accordance with  _Section 1.11_. 

   

 (b) The Company shall provide to Parent (i) prompt notice of its receipt of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock under the DGCL or demands for payment for such shares at their fair market value under the CGCL, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments relating to the Merger served pursuant to the DGCL or the CGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL or demands for payment for such shares at their fair market value under the CGCL.

  _Section 1.7(d)(v)_ with respect to such payments, the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock then distributable pursuant to _Section 1.15_ equal
to the aggregate Pro Rata Portion attributable to all Substituted Parent
Options (provided that the aggregate shares of Parent Common Stock that would
be fractional shares shall not be deposited with the Exchange Agent but shall
be cancelled by Parent or its stock transfer agent, and in lieu thereof
Parent shall provide the Exchange Agent with cash in an amount sufficient to
permit the 

   ##### 

  

    

payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.9)_ ; and
the Exchange Agent shall timely pay and distribute such shares in accordance
with _Section 1.7(a)(ii)(C)_, _Section 1.11(b)_, and the other applicable
provisions of this _Article I;_ and 

   

 (B) deliver to the Escrow Agent the shares of Parent Common Stock being distributed under _Section 1.15_ that constitute Earn Out Escrow Shares for deposit into the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Article VII_.

The Exchange Agent shall timely pay and distribute such shares deposited with it in accordance with _Section 1.7(a)(ii)(B)_,  _Section 1.11(b)_, and the other applicable provisions of this _Article I_ (provided that the aggregate shares of Parent Common Stock that would be fractional shares shall not be deposited with the Exchange Agent but shall be cancelled by Parent or its stock transfer agent, and in lieu thereof Parent shall provide the Exchange Agent with cash in an amount sufficient to permit the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.9_). If Parent has not made the election described in  _Section 1.7(d)(v)_ with respect to such amounts, a number of the shares of Parent Common Stock then distributable from the Escrow Fund equal to the aggregate Pro Rata Share attributable to all Substituted Parent Options shall be distributed by the Exchange Agent to the holders of such Substituted Parent Options, if and when issuable pursuant to  _Section 1.7(d)(i)(C)_. 

   

 (iv) Parent shall pay, or if Parent so elects, the Exchange Agent shall pay, the Option Cash (if any) to the holders of Substituted Parent Options at the time at which such holders become entitled to receive such Option Cash (if any) under _Section 1.7(d)(i)(C)_.

   ##### 

  

   

 (vi) All payments made pursuant to this _Section 1.11(a)_ shall be consistent with the hypothetical calculations set forth in _Schedule 1.11(a)_.

Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and any other required documentation specified in such letter of transmittal, the holder of such Company Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent promptly in exchange therefor the Merger consideration payable promptly after the Effective Time for each of the shares held by the holder pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_ and the other provisions of this _Article I._ 

   

 (ii) From and after each of the Earn Out Delivery Dates and upon each Escrow Payment: 

   

 (iii) (A) each Eligible Securityholder who was immediately prior to the Effective Time a holder of Company Capital Stock and has previously delivered a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal and other required documentation to the Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay and deliver, the Earn Out Shares or Escrow Shares then allocable to such Eligible Securityholder under _Section 1.7(a)_ and the other provisions of this _Article I_ (in each case, with cash in lieu of fractional shares) with respect to such Company Capital Stock; 

   

 (iv) (B) each Eligible Securityholder who was immediately prior to the Effective Time a holder of Company Capital Stock and has not delivered a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal and other required documentation to the Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, upon such delivery, shall receive, and the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay and deliver, the Earn Out Shares or Escrow Shares then allocable to such Eligible Securityholder under _Section 1.7(a)_ and the other provisions of this _Article I_ (in each case, with cash in lieu of fractional shares) with respect to such Company Capital Stock; 

   

 (v) (C) each Eligible Securityholder who was immediately prior to the Effective Time a holder of a Company Option, if any portion of such Company Option has vested as of the distribution date (without regard to whether such Company Option has been exercised), shall be entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall 

   ##### 

  

    

promptly pay and deliver, the Earn Out Shares or Escrow Shares then allocable
to such Eligible Securityholder under _Section 1.7(d)(i)_ and the other
provisions of this _Article I_ (with cash in lieu of fractional shares) with
respect to the vested portion of such Company Option; and 

   

 (vi) (D) each Eligible Stockholder who was immediately prior to the Effective Time a holder of a Company Option, if such Company Option is an Unvested Substituted Parent Option as of the distribution date, shall be entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay and deliver, the Earn Out Shares or Escrow Shares then allocable to such Eligible Securityholder under _Section 1.7(d)(i)_ and the other provisions of this _Article I_ (with cash in lieu of fractional shares), upon vesting of such Unvested Substituted Parent Option (or portions thereof).

Subject to applicable Law, following valid delivery of any such letter of transmittal and other documentation, there shall be paid to such record holder the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, and at the time of delivery of such shares of Parent Common Stock, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this _Section 1.11(d)_) with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, no holder of a Substituted Parent Option shall receive any such dividends or other distributions unless and until such option vests and the applicable shares of Parent Common Stock are payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)(i)(B)_ or _(C)_. 

   

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Person (whether in cash or securities of Parent) pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax Law (with any shares of Parent Common Stock withheld valued at the closing price per share as reported on the NYSE on the trading day preceding the payment). To the extent that such amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the 

     ##### 

  

    

relevant Governmental or Regulatory Authority by Parent, the Surviving Company

purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in
respect to which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 1.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_.

 1.13 [ _Intentionally omitted_ ] 

  

 1.14 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company or Merger Sub, or to perfect the Surviving Companys ownership of any and all Company Owned Intellectual Property, or to complete and prosecute all domestic and foreign patent and trademark filings related to Company Owned Intellectual Property, the officers of the Surviving Company are fully authorized to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action. 

  

 1.15 _Earn Out Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Earn Out Shares; Earn Out Milestones_. _Schedule 1.15_ sets forth two distributions that may be issued as additional consideration in the form of the Earn Out Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional shares related thereto) pursuant to this _Article I_, including without limitation _Sections 1.7(a)(ii)_ and _1.7(d)(i)_ , and the applicable Milestones that must be achieved in order for Parent to become obligated to issue any Earn Out Shares. Earn Out Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional shares related thereto) that are distributable under _Section 1.7(a)(ii)_, _Section 1.7(d)(i)_ and this _Section 1.15_ shall be promptly deposited with the Exchange Agent and shall be promptly distributed by the Exchange Agent to the Eligible Securityholders in accordance with this _Article I_, including without limitation _Section 1.11(b)(ii)_ (or to the extent appropriate in the case of shares of Company Capital Stock for which no letter of transmittal has then been delivered or Substituted Parent Options, reserved for issuance in accordance with _Section 1.11(b)(ii))_. 

   

 (b) _Procedure_. 

    

 (i) No later than each Earn Out Delivery Date, Parent shall provide to the Stockholder Agent either (A) a statement that the relevant Milestone for distribution of Earn Out Shares set forth in _Schedule 1.15_ has been achieved and, if relevant to such determination, appropriate supporting documentation regarding such 

   ##### 

  

    

Milestone, or (B) a statement that the relevant Milestone set forth in
_Schedule 1.15_ has not been achieved and, if relevant to such determination,
appropriate supporting documentation regarding such Milestone (each, in case
of either clause (A) or (B), an "Earn Out Determination"). If the Earn Out
Determination states that the applicable Milestone has been achieved, then no
action on the part of the Stockholder Agent shall be necessary and such Earn
Out Determination shall be deemed final (a "Final Earn Out Amount"). In any
other case, the Stockholder Agent will notify Parent in writing within
30 days of receipt of such Earn Out Determination if the Stockholder Agent
disputes such determination, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
the dispute (each an "Earn Out Dispute Notice"). During such 30-day period,
Parent shall provide all information reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Agent relating to the Earn-Out Determination. If the Stockholder Agent does
not deliver an Earn Out Dispute Notice within 30 days of receipt of an Earn
Out Determination or if the Stockholder Agent accepts such determination
in writing, such Earn Out Determination shall be deemed a Final Earn Out
Amount. In the event that an Earn Out Dispute Notice is delivered to Parent,
Parent and the Stockholder Agent shall meet within ten Business Days of the
delivery of such Earn Out Dispute Notice to attempt to resolve such dispute
in good faith. If a final resolution of such dispute is reached, the agreed
upon amount shall be deemed to be the Final Earn Out Amount. If no final
resolution is determined within fifteen Business Days of the delivery of such
Earn Out Dispute Notice after good faith negotiation, the final determination
of a Final Earn Out Amount shall be submitted by Parent or the Stockholder
Agent first, to non-binding mediation utilizing JAMS or such other mediator
acceptable to both parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, non-binding
mediation shall be used only if, and for the duration that, Parent and the
Stockholder Agent determine, each in its sole and absolute discretion, that
such non-binding mediation is likely to result in the savings of time
and expense, and would not postpone the resolution of any dispute relating to
the Final Earn Out Amount. In the event that Parent or the Stockholder Agent
determines not to enter into mediation, the final determination of the Final
Earn Out Amount shall instead be submitted to arbitration in accordance with
the procedures set forth in _Section 9.14_. In the event Parent and the
Stockholder Agent agree to enter into non-binding mediation, if no final
resolution of such dispute is reached within 30 days of appointment of the
mediator, or if the parties cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the
final determination of the Final Earn Out Amount shall be submitted to
arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 9.14_.
The determination of the arbitrator shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, be final, binding and conclusive upon each Eligible Securityholder, the
Stockholder Agent and Parent in accordance with the provisions of  _Section
9.14(c)_. 

   

 (ii) The Stockholder Agent may notify Parent in writing at any time that he believes a relevant Milestone has been achieved. Parent will cooperate in good faith with the Stockholder Agent to determine whether such Milestone has been achieved at such time. 

   

 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payments to be made to the Exchange Agent hereunder attributable to Substituted Parent Options will be subject to reduction by the amount payable by Parent or the Surviving Company to the 

   ##### 

  

    

holders of such Substituted Parent Options upon election by Parent to pay such
holders pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)(v)_. 

  

 (c) _Stockholder Agent_. The provisions of _Section 7.7_ shall apply to any acts taken by the Stockholder Agent pursuant to this _Section 1.15_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent in connection with this _Section 1.15_ shall constitute a decision of all Company Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Company Securityholders. Parent shall be entitled to rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of every Company Securityholder. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent. 

   

 (d) _No Assignment of Contingent Rights_. No interest in any Contingent Rights or any portion thereof may be assigned or transferred, directly or indirectly, to any Person (whether by operation of Law, or otherwise), and any attempt to do so will be null and void; except in the event of death of an Eligible Securityholder who is an individual, in which case, such Contingent Right may be transferred to such Eligible Securityholders estate, personal representative or heirs by will or the laws of descent and distribution; _provided_ , _however_ , that as a condition to any such transfer the transferee(s) shall hold such interests subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the right (if any) to receive distributions of any Earn Out Shares or Escrow Shares shall be personal to the Eligible Securityholders and such right shall not (i) attach to or run with any Parent securities issued in exchange for any Company Capital Stock or upon exercise of Substituted Parent Options, or (ii) inure to the benefit of any purchaser, assignee or other transferee of such Parent securities. 

   

 (e) _No Interest_. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any Closing Cash, Closing Shares, Earn Out Shares or Escrow Shares or any payment or distribution relating to the Closing Shares, Earn Out Shares or Escrow Shares, including any payments of cash in lieu of such shares or to holders of Unvested Substituted Parent Options. 

   

 1.16 _Return of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the cash and Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent that remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any Company Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ and received the Merger consideration to which they are then entitled to receive for such Company Stockholders shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock, in each case, without any interest thereon, and subject to _Section 1.19_, Parent shall pay and distribute such cash and Parent Common Stock to the same extent, at the same times, and in the same manner, as would be required hereunder of the Exchange Agent had such cash and Parent Common Stock not been returned to Parent under this Section. 

  

 1.17 _Exemption From Registration; California Permit_. Parent and the Company intend that the Parent securities to be issued pursuant to _Section 1.7_ in connection with the Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act, by 

   #####

Parent securities to be issued pursuant to _Section 1.7_ in connection with
the Merger will be qualified under the California Code, pursuant to Section
25121 thereof, after a fairness hearing has been held pursuant to the
authority granted by Section 25142 of such law (the "Fairness Hearing"). Each
of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
file promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, an
application for issuance of a permit pursuant to Section 25121 of the
California Code to issue such securities (the "California Permit"), and (ii)
to obtain the California Permit as promptly as practicable thereafter. 

  

 1.18 _Calculation of Closing Cash_. At least three Business Days prior to the Effective Time (and updated no more than one Business Day prior to the Effective Time), for purposes of determining the Closing Cash under  _Section 1.6(a)(i)_, the Company shall deliver to Parent its good faith determination of (a) the amount of the Closing Founder Loan Cash as of the Closing Date, which shall be as set forth in  _Schedule 1.6(c)_; (b) the amount required to repay, in full, the Parent Loan as of the Closing Date, including all accrued and unpaid interest through the Closing Date, which shall be as set forth on _Schedule 1.18(b)_; (c) the amount of the Closing Company Net Indebtedness (including Cash and the other components thereof), which shall be as set forth on _Schedule 1.18(c)_ ; and (d) the amount of the 2010 Interest, which shall be as set forth on _Schedule 1.18(d)_.

Company Owned Intellectual Property developed by such a consultant does not
belong to the third party or conflict with the third partys employment or
consulting agreement (such steps include ensuring that all research and
development work performed by such a consultant are performed only on the
facilities of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and only using
the resources of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries). 

   

 (t) For purposes of this _Section 2.17_ other than _Section 2.17(h)_, all references to the currently conducted business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or similar terms, mean such businesses as currently conducted and as contemplated to be conducted in any product roadmap or other written materials previously delivered to Parent, including the design, development, distribution, marketing, manufacture, use, import, license, and sale of the products, technology and services of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including products, technology, or services currently under development) described in such product roadmaps or other written materials. 

   

 2.18 _Material Contracts_. 

  

 (a) _Section 2.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of each of the Material Contracts (true and complete copies or, if none, reasonably complete and accurate written descriptions of which, together with all amendments and supplements thereto and all waivers of any terms thereof, have been made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement), to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective Assets and Properties are bound (other than Confidential Contracts, information on the terms of which has been provided pursuant to _Section 2.18(d)_ below). 

   

 (b) Each Material Contract required to be disclosed in _Section 2.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement, enforceable against the Company or its applicable Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, and, except as disclosed in _Section 2.18(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of the Company or its Subsidiaries, each other party thereto, except to the extent such Material Contract has expired by its own terms. Except as disclosed in  _Section 2.18(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i) neither the Company nor its applicable Subsidiaries, or any other party to such Material Contract is, nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries received notice that it is, or given notice that any other party is, in violation or breach of or default under any such Material Contract (or with notice or lapse of time or both, would be in violation or breach of or default under any such Material Contract) and (ii) there exists no condition and no event has occurred that has caused or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under any Material Contract.

With respect to the terms of the Confidential Contracts that may not be disclosed to Parent, without such disclosure being a violation of the confidentiality obligations of the Company to the other parties to such Confidentiality Contract (the "Confidential Terms"), the Confidential Terms are commercially reasonable in light of the use by or services to the Company and its Subsidiaries under such Contract, as well as consistent with the customary or standard terms and conditions of similar agreements within the industry. Except as disclosed in _Section 2.18(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Contracts were entered into on an arms-length basis. No Confidential Terms restrict in any manner, the ability of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates to engage or compete in any line of business or to compete in any geographical area. Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Merger and any other transactions contemplated hereby, will violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a material default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the triggering of any payment obligations under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Assets and Properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable or without further binding effect, or result in any other modification of or trigger any right or obligation under, any Confidential Terms (either alone or in conjunction with the other terms of the Confidential Contracts, except to the extent evident on the face of the redacted versions of the Confidential Contracts provided to Parent).

Except for the initial public announcement regarding entry into this Agreement, as to which the parties have agreed upon the form, unless otherwise required by Law (including federal and state securities Laws) or, as to Parent, by the rules and regulations of the NYSE, prior to the Effective Time, no public disclosure (whether or not in response to any inquiry) of the existence of any subject matter of, or the terms and conditions of, this Agreement shall be made by any party hereto unless approved by Parent and the Company prior to release; _provided_ , _however_ , that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In addition, (a) Parent may make public statements in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, and (b) the Company may make such disclosures as are required to be made by the Company in connection with its compliance with requirements under Contracts to which it is a party to provide notice to, obtain the consent of, or obtain a waiver from, any Person in order to perform under this Agreement; so long as in each case, any such statements accurately describe and relate solely to information contained in this Agreement or are within the scope of the information provided in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this  _Section 5.6_. 

  

 5.7 _FIRPTA Compliance_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3). 

  

 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of: 

  

 (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact, change, circumstance, condition or event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is reasonably likely to cause (or has caused) any representation or warranty of the Company, on the part of the Company, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the part of Parent, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Closing Date; 

   

 (b) any failure or inability of the Company, on the part of the Company, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the part of Parent, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; 

    ##### 

   

     

 (c) the receipt of any notice or communication (whether written or oral) that claims that any Person holds or is entitled to any equity interest in the Company not disclosed pursuant to  _Section 2.3(b)_ or _Section 2.3(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule on the date hereof; or 

   

 (d) any licensor, vendor, supplier, licensee or customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who cancels or otherwise modifies in any adverse respect its relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a manner material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any such Person communicates in writing or gives credible oral notice, to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any intention to do so; 

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.8_ shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to
the party receiving such notice. 

   

 5.9 [ _Intentionally Omitted_.] 

  

 5.10 _Additional Documents and Further Assurances; Cooperation_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (i) each party, at the request of any other party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments reasonably necessary to seek and obtain any and all Approvals of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority or other Person required in connection with the Merger, (ii) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in order to obtain all necessary consents and approvals from Governmental or Regulatory Authorities, or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to satisfy the conditions set forth in  _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_  as promptly as practicable, and (iii) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in order to obtain all necessary consents and approvals from Governmental or Regulatory Authorities, or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ as promptly as practicable. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no party shall be obligated to consent to any divestitures or operational limitations in connection with any Approvals required hereunder (including any Approvals required under the HSR Act) and no party shall be obligated to make a payment of money (other than nominal and customary filing fees) as a condition to obtaining any such Approval. 

   

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party shall make any necessary or advisable filings under any Antitrust Law, including an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, if necessary or advisable, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within seven Business Days of the date hereof or the determination such filing is necessary or advisable, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, and, if applicable, take all 

   ##### 

   

   

other actions necessary or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable,
including by requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for
in the HSR Act. 

   

 (d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in this _Section 5.10_ and subject to the terms hereof, use commercially reasonable efforts (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any proceeding, investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental or Regulatory Authority and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental or Regulatory Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental or Regulatory Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; provided that the parties shall not have an obligation to exchange any information that constitutes "business secrets," including Item 4(c) attachments to any notification form required by the HSR Act. 

   

 5.11 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms of Section 5 of the Non-Competition Agreements, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Company agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the employees, agents, directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company Indemnified Parties") as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement and previously provided to Parent, applicable Law or otherwise shall continue in full force and effect from and after the Closing Date until the six-year anniversary thereof with respect to all claims for which such indemnification or exculpation rights may be asserted, assuming the consummation of the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue to disposition of any and all such claims asserted or made within such period, and (ii) the Surviving Company shall have no liability for any claim, if such claim would be a breach of the representation set forth in the last sentence of this clause (a). Absent agreement between the Surviving Company and the applicable Company Indemnified Party, any determination required to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth in the Companys or its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or indemnification agreements, applicable Law or otherwise shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon by the Surviving Company and the Company Indemnified Party (and fees and expenses of the independent counsel shall be paid by the Surviving Company), which such determination shall be final and binding on the parties thereto. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent that no claim for indemnification has been made by any director or officer of the Company or other 

   ##### 

  

   

Company Indemnified Party, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
reasonable basis exists for any such claim for indemnification. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this  _Section 5.11_ shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company, and shall be enforceable by the current and former directors and officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries and their respective successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.11_. 

   

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, any payments made by the Surviving Company pursuant to  _Section 5.11(a)_ under its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, applicable Law or indemnification agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement, including any indemnification obligations arising from the directors actions in connection with approving the terms of this Agreement, shall be Losses that are indemnifiable under _Article VII_ to the extent the Surviving Companys indemnification obligations hereunder are the result of or arise from matters subject to indemnification under _Article VII_. 

   

 5.12 _Form S-8_. Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Options within five Business Days after the Effective Time to the extent the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Options qualify for registration on Form S-8. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and the current status of the prospectus relating thereto for as long as such Company Options remain outstanding. 

  

 5.13 _NYSE Listing of Additional Shares Application_. Parent shall, to the extent required by the rules of the NYSE, use its commercially reasonable efforts to list on the NYSE the shares of Parent Common Stock required to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger. 

  

 5.14 _Company s Auditors_. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its management and its independent auditors to facilitate on a timely basis (a) the preparation of financial statements (including pro forma financial statements, if required) as necessary or required by Parent to comply with applicable regulations of the SEC and the California Commissioner of Corporations and interpretations thereof, (b) the review of any Company audit or review work papers, including the examination of selected interim financial statements and data, (c) the delivery of such representations from the Companys independent accountants as may be reasonably requested by Parent or its accountants, including a consent to be filed as an exhibit to the Permit Application, and (d) the securing of a binding fee commitment (on terms similar to those in place on the date of this Agreement) with respect to consents and comfort letters requested by Parent after the Closing. 

   ##### 

  

  

 5.15 _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Unless Parent requests otherwise in writing at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the board of directors of the Company shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective prior to the Effective Time, any Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and which is sponsored, or contributed to, by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. At the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent (a) executed resolutions of the board of directors of the Company authorizing such termination and (b) as necessary, an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan fully vesting all participants and terminating the 401(k) Plan. 

  

 5.16 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the boards of directors of each of the parties hereto will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 5.17 _Actions to Qualify as a "Reorganization"._  It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue Code. Neither Parent nor the Company shall take, nor permit its Affiliates to take, any action prior to or following the Closing that would cause the Merger, including the delivery of all Parent Common Stock to the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Options under  _Section 1.7_, to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and each shall report all transactions under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in accordance with their characterizations herein. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees to deliver certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable counsel to deliver the Tax Opinions required by _Section 6.2(d)_ and _Section 6.3(m)_, which certificates shall be effective as of the date of such Tax Opinions. 

  

 5.18 _Intentionally Omitted_. 

  

 5.19 _Information Technology Access_. Because of the substantial lead time that may be required to order and install new software and hardware to integrate the Companys IT systems with Parents, and the importance of a smooth integration of such IT systems promptly after the Closing, the Company agrees that Parent may order, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, either in Parents name or, if required by the vendor, the Companys name, but in either case at Parents sole cost and expense, any new IT services, hardware and software that Parent believes will be needed at the Companys facilities in order to coordinate Parents and the Companys respective operations following the Closing. For clarity, it is the parties intent not to connect any of the ordered services or systems prior to the Closing. If the Closing does not occur, Parent shall reimburse the Company for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by it at the request of Parent in connection with the ordering of IT services, hardware and software contemplated by this  _Section 5.19_. If Parent is so required to reimburse the Company, Parent will own any such hardware and software, and shall pay for the reasonable costs to remove such hardware and software from the Company or its Subsidiarys premises. 

   ##### 

  

   

Parent and the Company will cooperate in the removal of any such hardware or
software so as to minimize any disruption to the Companys or
its Subsidiarys business. In addition, if the Closing does not occur,
the Company will reasonably cooperate with Parent in promptly canceling any
orders for IT services, hardware or software and will otherwise act to
minimize the costs which might be incurred in connection with the IT
integration efforts. 

  

 5.20 _Intellectual Property_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice that any Person shall have (i) commenced, or shall have notified the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it intends to commence, any Actions or Proceedings or (ii) provided the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with notice, in either case which allege(s) that any of the Company Owned Intellectual Property, including the Company Owned Intellectual Property, presently embodied, or proposed to be embodied, in the Companys products or utilized in any development tools or design environments designed or modified by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, infringes or otherwise violates the Intellectual Property rights of such Person, is available for licensing from a potential licensor (whether or not the Person providing the notice), or otherwise alleges that the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries do not own or have the right to exploit such Company Owned Intellectual Property. 

  

 5.21 _Delivery of Stock Ledger and Minute Book of the Company_. The Company shall deliver its stock ledger and minute book and those of each of its Subsidiaries to Parent at the Closing. 

  

 5.22 _Certain Employee Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) Each person who has accepted employment with the Surviving Company (including executing Parents standard form of Employee Creation and Non-Disclosure Agreement and associated schedules and statements without amendment or modification thereto in any substantive respect (other than disclosure and exceptions of prior inventions that are reasonably acceptable to Parent)) and who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (individually, a "Continuing Employee" and collectively, the "Continuing Employees") shall be an employee of the Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, immediately following the Effective Time. For purposes of this _Section 5.22(a)_ and _Section 6.3(g)_, any determination made by Parent with respect to the addition of disclosure and exceptions for prior inventions on any Employee Creation and Non-Disclosure Agreement that is consistent with Parents standard employee screening practices during the three years prior to the date hereof shall be deemed reasonable. 

   

 (b) Following a reasonable transition period determined by Parent, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive substantially the same benefits as those maintained for similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, consistent with Parents applicable human resources policies and in accordance with the terms of Parents employee benefit plans. For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual) under any Parent employee benefit plan, Parent shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide that the Continuing Employees receive service credit under each Parent employee benefit plan (other than a defined benefit plan) for their period of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, except where doing so would cause a 

     ##### 

  

    

duplication of benefits. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate with its outside carriers so that, for the calendar year including
the Closing Date, the Continuing Employees shall not be required to satisfy
any deductible, co-payment, out-of-pocket maximum or similar requirements
under any Parent employee benefit plans that provide medical, dental and
other welfare benefits (collectively, the "Parent Welfare Plans") to the
extent of amounts previously credited for such purposes under the Plans that
provide medical, dental and other welfare benefits (the "Company Welfare
Plans"). Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate
with its outside carriers so that, any waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions and requirements to show evidence of good health
contained in such Parent Welfare Plans shall be waived with respect to the
Continuing Employees (except to the extent any such waiting period, pre-
existing condition exclusion, or requirement of show evidence of good health
applied under the applicable Company Welfare Plan in which the participant
then participates or is otherwise eligible to participate as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time). 

   

 (c) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent a validly executed and delivered Non-Competition Agreement for each individual listed on  _Schedule 5.22(c)_, which Non-Competition Agreements shall become effective as of the Effective Time in accordance with their terms. 

   

 (d) In addition to Parents assumption of Company Options pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_, within six months after the Closing Date, Parent shall have issued to employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) who were employees of the Company at the Effective Time options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with and as set forth in  _Schedule 5.22(d)_. The price of such options shall be no greater than the fair market value of shares of Parent Common Stock at the time of grant pursuant to the Companys stock option grant policies, and the vesting and other terms and conditions of such options shall be no less favorable to the optionee than those that are issued to employees of the Parent generally. 

   

 (e) Nothing in this _Section 5.22_ shall give any Company personnel or any other Person a right to employment or any other right under this Agreement as a third-party beneficiary or be deemed an amendment of any employment agreement or any employee benefit plan. 

   

 5.23 _No Control_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement will give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations. 

  

 5.24 _Supplement to Company Disclosure Schedule_. The Company may revise or supplement the following items of the Company Disclosure Schedule from and after the date of this Agreement up to one Business Day prior to the Closing to reflect information that came into existence after the date hereof and would have been required to be disclosed on the Company Disclosure Schedule if such information was in existence on the date hereof: (a) _Sections 2.3(a)  (d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule solely to reflect (i) issuances of Company Common Stock, (ii) transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock, (iii) the issuance of Company Options, 

   ##### 

  

   

or (iv) changes that result from the Companys exercise of any repurchase
rights it has in connection with the termination or resignation of any
employee, consultant or other service provider; (b) _Sections 2.3(b)_ and
_2.3(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule solely to reflect updated
information that the Company receives regarding the state or country of
residence of any Company Securityholder; (c) _Section 2.5_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule solely to update the list of directors and
officers of the Company; (d)  _Section 2.8_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule solely to identify any actions of the Board of Directors or
stockholders of the Company; (e) _Section 2.18(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule solely to reflect the entry into Material Contracts
permitted under this Agreement or the expiration of any Material Contract
pursuant to its terms; (f) _Section 2.19(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule solely to reflect additions or replacements to the list of
insurance policies; and (g) _Section 2.21(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule solely to reflect new employees and consultants of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries hired or engaged;  _provided_ _however_ , in each
case that such actions or other item disclosed is otherwise in compliance
with and not prohibited by this Agreement. Revisions or supplements to
the Company Disclosure Schedule made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for purposes of _Section 6.3(a)_ and
_Article VII_ of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 5.24_ shall limit
the obligation of the Company to provide any required notice under _Section
5.8_. 

  

 5.25 _Operation of the Surviving Company Post-Closing_. 

  

 (a) After the Effective Time until the Second Earn Out Delivery Date (the "Earn Out Period"), Parent and the Surviving Company shall act in good faith and shall not make any decisions or take any actions for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the Earn Out Shares (the "Earn Out Operating Restrictions"). 

   

 (b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company breaches the Earn-Out Operating Restrictions in any material respect or terminates the employment of any of the individuals listed on _Schedule 5.22(c)_ other than for Cause, or an individual listed on  _Schedule 5.22(c)_ resigns his or her employment with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries for Good Reason, in each case, excluding any such individual that does not become an employee of the Surviving Company upon the Effective Time (each, an "Earn Out Trigger Event"), then any Milestone the period for determination of which ends on a date following the date such Earn Out Trigger Event occurs, shall be deemed to have been successfully achieved, and Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Eligible Securityholders in accordance with  _Section 1.11_ the Earn-Out Shares with respect to such Milestone(s) (less the Escrow Shares applicable to such Earn Out Shares, which Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent and Earn-Out Shares payable to holders of Substituted Parent Options) within ten Business Days following the occurrence of such Earn Out Trigger Event (the "Accelerated Earn Out Payment"). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Accelerated Earn-Out Payment is reasonable in light of the actual damages that would be incurred by the Eligible Securityholders in connection with the occurrence of an Earn Out Trigger Event and further acknowledge and agree that such actual damages would be difficult to determine with exactness. THE RECEIPT OF THE ACCELERATED EARN-OUT PAYMENT BY THE ELIGIBLE STOCKHOLDERS IS NOT INTENDED TO AND SHALL NOT BE A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY, BUT IS INTENDED TO AND SHALL CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, PROVIDED THAT 

     ##### 

  

    

SUCH RECEIPT, IF ANY, SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IN THE EVENT OF
SUCH EARN OUT TRIGGER EVENT. 

   

 (c) In the event that (1) prior to the Closing or during the Earn Out Period Parent is subject to a Change of Control, or (2) during the Earn Out Period Parent or any of its Subsidiaries sells or otherwise transfers all or substantially all of the business of the Company to any Person not affiliated with Parent (whether by asset sale, merger or otherwise, but not including a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries); then in each case, upon written demand of the Stockholder Agent, Parent shall make the Accelerated Earn-Out Payment. In the event of a Change of Control of Parent (i) during the Earn Out Period, the Accelerated Earn-Out Payment shall be paid immediately preceding the Change of Control, or (ii) prior to the Closing, the Accelerated Earn-Out Payment shall be due and payable at the Closing together with the deposit with the Exchange Agent of the Closing Shares. 

   

 (d) Parent shall provide written notice to the Stockholder Agent of the occurrence of any event or condition that Parent believes constitutes a breach of _Section 5.25(a)_ promptly after becoming aware of such event or condition. 

   

 (e) Except as set forth in _Section 5.25(a)_ above, nothing herein shall in any way (i) limit or restrict the business practices or decisions of Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, following the Closing, or (ii) obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to apply any special efforts or dedicate any special level of personnel or other resources to the business of the Company following Closing, which resources shall be determined by Parent in its sole discretion as appropriate and in the best interests of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

   

 5.26 _Legal Representation_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law (including ethical rules relating to conflicts), from and after the Effective Time, Parent, for itself and its Affiliates (including, at such time, the Surviving Company) consents to the representation of Raju Vegesna by Arnold and Porter LLP, Richard McCoy or Amir Ohebsion, a Professional Corporation, in connection with any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding or claim that may arise between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, at such time, the Surviving Company), on the one hand, and Raju Vegesna, on the other hand, resulting from or in connection with (i) this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the negotiation or implementation of such agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or (ii) any services that Raju Vegesna provides to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, at such time, the Surviving Company), whether as an employee or otherwise, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waives irrevocably any conflict of interest or other objection to such representation. 

  

 5.27 _Restrictions With Respect to Certain Information_. 

  

 (a) For a period of two years after the Effective Date, without the prior consent of Raju Vegesna, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall, and each shall not direct or cause its Affiliates or Representatives to: 

    ##### 

  

      

 (i) search the records (whether hard copies, electronic or otherwise) of the Surviving Company (or any successor to such records), created prior to the Closing, with intent to obtain any documents, electronic files, materials or information created by the Protected Group and distributed solely to the Company and other members of the Protected Group or communications sent by the Company or Raju Vegesna solely to the Protected Group, in each case, as part of the representation of the Company or Raju Vegesna by the Protected Group (A) in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the negotiation or implementation of such agreements or the transactions expressly contemplated hereby and thereby, or (B) in connection with other matters unrelated to the Company and its Subsidiaries, including their respective businesses (for the avoidance of doubt, this clause (i) shall not apply to documents, electronic files, materials or information lawfully obtained by Parent or its Representatives from the Company or Raju Vegesna prior to the Closing); or 

   

 (ii) search the records (whether hard copies, electronic or otherwise) of the Surviving Company (or any successor to such records), created prior to the Closing, with intent to obtain any documents, electronic files, materials or information that would be reasonably expected to relate to matters of the Founders that are unrelated to the Company and its Subsidiaries, including records relating to any other business in which a Founder is involved or personal records or communications. 

  

 (b) If the management of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries discovers or obtains any information described in _Section 5.27(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ above, upon becoming aware of the nature of such information, (i) such person or persons shall not read (or shall cease reading, if applicable), review or analyze such information immediately upon discovering its nature, and (ii) such person shall direct Parents employees and other Representatives that such person knows are aware of such information not to read, review or analyze such information and of Parents obligation under this _Section 5.27_ to keep such information confidential. None of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall use such information for any purpose or disclose such information to any other Person. For the avoidance of doubt, any use or disclosure of such information in violation of Parents employee policies regarding confidentiality of Parent information, which use or disclosure was not done at the direction of Parent or its Subsidiaries, shall not be a violation of the foregoing. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the restrictions contained in _Sections 5.27(a)_ and _5.27(b)_ shall not apply to any document, electronic file, material or information that, without violation of _Sections 5.27(a)_ or _5.27(b)_ , (i) was in the public domain or available from public sources at the time of its discovery by Parent or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in the documents, electronic files or other materials formerly belonging to the Company (the "Discovery Time") or has entered the public domain other than by disclosure by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries; (ii) was already known to Parent or its Subsidiaries at the Discovery Time, as evidenced by contemporaneous written records; (iii) relates to a crime or fraud perpetrated by the Company, one of its Subsidiaries or the Founders, (iv) is reasonably related to any dispute between Parent or the Surviving Company and any of the Protected Group (including fee disputes); (v) is reasonably related to any dispute with any other third party, including customers of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Company 

   ##### 

  

   

Securityholder, or (vi) is required to be searched or disclosed pursuant to a
Law, an Order, a rule or requirement of a Governmental or Regulatory
Authority, subpoena, document request or other legal process (including SEC
rules and regulations); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that in the event
that Parent or any of its Representatives are required by an Order,
applicable Law, regulation or other legal process to disclose any information
referred to in _Section 5.27(a)_, Parent shall promptly notify the Founder
to whom such document, electronic file, material or other information relates
in writing, and reasonably cooperate with such Founder, so that such Founder
or another appropriate Person may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy to prevent public disclosure of such information.

 (a) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)(i)_, and no Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, unless and until the aggregate Loss or Losses for all such claims, in the aggregate by all Parent Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, is in excess of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the "Basket Amount"), in which case such Parent Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified, including the Basket Amount.

 (f) An Indemnified Party shall make commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate any Losses that it asserts under this _Article VII_, including, but not limited to, pursuing recovery under any available insurance policies or arrangements or other indemnity rights that it may have to the extent it is commercially reasonable mitigation to do so. 

  

 (g) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses arising from Third Party Claims unless and except to the extent that the third party bringing such Third Party Claim prevails, which shall be deemed to have occurred if and only if (i) a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final, non-appealable judgment against such Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim or (ii) the Third Party Claim is settled or compromised with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (or such consent is not required pursuant to terms of the last sentence of  _Section 7.5(b)(iii)_). 

  

 7.5 _Claims for Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) _Procedure for Claims_. 

   

 (i) An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under this  _Article VII_ (other than a Third-Party Claim covered by _Section 7.5(b)_ below) shall deliver to (1) the Stockholder Agent and the Escrow Agent, in the case of indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2_, or (2) Parent, in the case of indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.3,_ a certificate (a "Claim Certificate") signed by such Indemnified Party, or if such Indemnified Party is an entity, any officer of such Indemnified Party, (A) stating that it has paid, sustained or incurred, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain or incur, Losses (the aggregate 

   ##### 

  

    

amount of such Losses being referred to as the "Claimed Amount"), (B)
specifying in reasonable detail the facts pertinent to such claim(s), the
individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, and the nature
or basis for indemnification to which such item is related, and (C) demanding
payment of the portion of the Claimed Amount that is then certain and
quantifiable (the Indemnified Party shall, with respect to that portion of
the Claimed Amount that represents anticipated Losses, provide a supplement
to the Claim Certificate to the applicable Persons identified in clauses (1)
and (2) above as soon as reasonably practicable with the actual amount of
Losses paid, incurred or sustained once such amounts become known, which
supplement shall be deemed delivered as of the date of the original Claim
Certificate for purposes of _Section 7.1(a)_). 

   

 (ii) Within 30 days after delivery of such Claim Certificate (including upon delivery of any supplement thereto), Parent or the Stockholder Agent, as applicable, shall deliver to the Indemnified Party, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (if indemnification is sought out of the Escrow Fund), a written response which shall: (A) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case, if indemnification is out of the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Agent and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within five Business Days following delivery of the response, a written notice executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Parent Indemnified Party, a number of Escrow Shares (rounded up to the nearest share) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Claimed Amount by the Calculated Stock Price, or if indemnification is being made by Parent, Parent shall pay the Exchange Agent the Claimed Amount in cash within three Business Days following delivery of the response), (B) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount, including because some portion of the Claimed Amount remains uncertain (the portion that is agreed upon, the "Agreed Amount") (in which case, if indemnification is out of the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Agent and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within five Business Days following delivery of the response, a written notice executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Parent Indemnified Party, out of the Escrow Fund, a number of Escrow Shares (rounded up to the nearest share) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Agreed Amount by the Calculated Stock Price, or if indemnification is being made by Parent, Parent shall pay the Stockholder Agent the Agreed Amount in cash within three Business Days following delivery of the response), or (C) contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. If the Stockholder Agent fails to respond within 30 days after the delivery of a Claim Certificate (including upon delivery of a supplement thereto), the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay the Claimed Amount specified in such notice in accordance with instructions provided therein. If Parent or the Stockholder Agent in such response contests the payment of all or part of the Claimed Amount, then such contesting party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute in accordance with _Section 7.5(c)_ below. Where the basis for a claim by an Indemnified Party is that such Indemnified Party reasonably anticipates that it will pay or accrue a Loss, no payment or credit will be made for such Loss unless and until such Loss is actually paid or accrued. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the concept of "indemnity" as used in this  _Article VII_ is intended to include, among others, claims between or among the parties to this Agreement and not involving any other Person, as well as third-party claims, and a claim by any Indemnified Party for indemnity or other recovery for Losses arising from any event, circumstance or condition not involving a Third-Party Claim that may be payable under the terms of this Agreement may be asserted by delivery of a Claim Certificate from the Parent Indemnified Party to the Stockholder Agent or the Seller Indemnified Party to Parent, as applicable. 

  

 (b) _Procedure for Third-Party Claims_. 

   

 (i) All claims for indemnification made under this Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a claim by a Third-Party Claimant against an Indemnified Party ("Third-Party Claim") shall be made in accordance with the following procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a Third-Party Claim which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a Loss that is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Stockholder Agent with a copy to the Escrow Agent, if indemnification is sought under _Section 7.2_ , or Parent, if indemnification is sought under _Section 7.3_, of such claim by delivery of a Claim Certificate to such party. Delay or failure in so notifying the Stockholder Agent or Parent shall relieve the applicable Indemnifying Parties of their obligations under this _Article VII_ only to the extent, if at all, that such Indemnifying Parties are prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. If there is a Third-Party Claim that, if adversely determined would give rise to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred or accrued by the applicable Indemnified Party or Parties in defense of such Third-Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim, shall be deemed Losses hereunder. 

   

 (ii) Within thirty days after delivery of such Claim Certificate, Parent may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party or Parties, if indemnification is sought under _Section 7.3_, or to the Stockholder Agent, if indemnification is sought under  _Section 7.2_, assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim with legal counsel selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party or Parties. 

   

 (iii) If Parent does not assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim as provided in clause (ii) above, the Indemnified Party or the Stockholder Agent, as applicable, shall control such defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that if pursuant to clause (ii) above, Parent assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice of counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Third-Party Claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel and one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction for all Indemnified Parties solely in connection therewith shall be considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement. If Parent or any of its Affiliates is an Indemnified Party in connection with a Third-Party Claim, and Parent controls the defense thereof, all reasonable costs related to such defense shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement. The party controlling the
defense shall (i) keep the other party reasonably advised of the status of
such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof, (ii) shall consider all
reasonable recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto, and
(iii) shall not agree to any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, such Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party, as
applicable (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless such settlement or compromise or consent (A) includes a
complete release of all Indemnified Parties from all liability with respect
to all claims underlying the Third Party Claim, and (B) does not impose any
liability or material obligation on any potential Indemnified Party or a
claim of any material amount from the Escrow Fund. 

   

 (iv) If the Stockholder Agent or Parent assumes control of the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party, as applicable, shall cooperate fully with all reasonable requests of the Stockholder Agent or Parent, as applicable, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon request) the provision of reasonably requested records or other information that is reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to provide additional information and explanation of any such reasonably relevant material. 

  

 (c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. 

   

 (i) If the Stockholder Agent or Parent shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Claim Certificate, the Stockholder Agent and Parent (or other Parent Indemnified Party) shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims within forty-five days following the delivery by the Stockholder Agent or Parent of its rejection of a Claimed Amount in such Claim Certificate. If the Stockholder Agent and Parent (or other Parent Indemnified Party) should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement, including the Agreed Amount, shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. 

   

 (ii) If the Stockholder Agent and Parent (or other Parent Indemnified Party) should not so agree, then such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.14_. The determination of the arbitrators, which shall include the Agreed Amount for such dispute, if any, pursuant to the procedures set forth in  _Section 9.14_ shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be final, binding, and conclusive upon each Company Securityholder, each Seller Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Agent, Parent or other Parent Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent, in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.14(c)_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is any claim by or on behalf of any Seller Indemnified Party or Parties under this _Article VII_ (a "Seller Claim"), and an Action or Proceeding is filed claiming a violation of any state or federal securities laws relating to or arising from the same or similar facts, claims or events as the Seller Claim, whether filed by or on behalf of a Seller Indemnified Party or by any other stockholder of Parent or any purchaser or seller of securities of Parent under such securities laws (each, a "Related Securities Action"), the Seller Claim shall not be submitted to arbitration pursuant to clause (ii) above (or if already submitted, will be stayed), until the Related Securities Action has been fully resolved. Thereafter, in any arbitration of the Seller Claim hereunder, the arbitrator(s) shall not make, and the Seller Indemnified Party or Parties shall be estopped from requesting, any determinations inconsistent with the factual determinations of the court in the Related Securities Action. 

  

 7.6 _Escrow Fund_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent, U.S. Bank National Association (such escrow agent, or any successor thereto, the "Escrow Agent"), and the Stockholder Agent shall execute and deliver an Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the "Escrow Agreement"), and, as promptly as practicable after the Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit all of the Closing Escrow Shares with the Escrow Agent for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations set forth in this _Article VII_ (the "Escrow Fund") and the Stockholder Fund Escrow Shares for the sole use of the Stockholder Agent. The Escrow Fund and the Stockholder Agent Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Fund and the Stockholder Agent Fund shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (b) Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, upon the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Initial Escrow Date"), a number of Escrow Shares equal to the product of (A) fifty percent and (B) the number of Escrow Shares placed into the Escrow Fund as of such date (subject to adjustment pursuant to the last sentence of this clause (b)), _less_ the number of Escrow Shares paid out of the Escrow Fund as of such date to pay any satisfied Claimed Amounts (subject to adjustment pursuant to the last sentence of this clause (b)),  _less_ the number of Escrow Shares, based on the Calculated Stock Price, having a value equal to such amounts as are reasonably necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied Claimed Amounts specified in any Claim Certificate delivered to the Stockholder Agent on or prior to the Initial Escrow Date with respect to facts and circumstances relating to a claim pursuant to this _Article VII_, but not less than zero, shall promptly (and in no event later than five Business Days after the Initial Escrow Date) be delivered to the Eligible Securityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions. All amounts used in calculations in this _clause (b)_ shall be adjusted to the extent, if any, reasonably necessary to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock), reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock the effective date of which occurs on or after the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, upon the Expiration Date, a number of Escrow Shares equal to (y) the number of Escrow Shares then remaining in the Escrow Fund, if any, _less_ (z) the number of Escrow Shares, based on the Calculated Stock Price, having a value equal to such amounts (such amounts, the "Disputed Amounts") as are reasonably necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims with respect to which indemnification has been sought under this _Article VII_ (the "Unsatisfied Claims") specified in any Claim Certificate delivered to the Stockholder Agent on or prior to the Expiration Date with respect to facts and circumstances relating to a claim pursuant to this _Article VII_, shall promptly (and in no event later than five Business Days after the Expiration Date) be delivered to the Eligible Securityholders in accordance with _Section 1.11(b)_. 

  

 (d) Disputed Amounts after the Expiration Date shall remain in the Escrow Fund until the Unsatisfied Claim relating to such Disputed Amounts has been finally resolved. Promptly following the time that any Unsatisfied Claim has been resolved after the Expiration Time, the Stockholder Agent and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly (and in no event later than five Business Days after the date of such written notice) pay such amounts as are payable to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to the resolution of the applicable Unsatisfied Claim and pay the remaining Escrow Shares, if any, held to satisfy such Unsatisfied Claim to the Eligible Securityholders in accordance with _Section 1.11(b);_ provided, that Parent shall not be required to deliver to the Escrow Agent such notice with respect to a delivery of Escrow Shares to the Eligible Securityholders until the earlier of (i) the date that is 90 days after the date of Parents then most recent delivery of a written notice to the Escrow Agent with respect to a delivery of Escrow Shares to the Eligible Securityholders (unless no prior notice has been given by Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.6(d)_, in which case the applicable date shall be the date that is 90 days after the Expiration Date), at which point Parent shall deliver a notice with respect to the resolution of all Unresolved Claims in such 90-day period that result in the delivery of Escrow Shares to the Eligible Securityholders, or (ii) promptly after the date upon which any Unsatisfied Claim (including the Unsatisfied Claim in question) is resolved that alone, or together with all other Unsatisfied Claims resolved since the preceding delivery of Escrow Shares to Eligible Securityholders pursuant to _Section 7.6(c)_ or this _Section 7.6(d)_, results in the delivery to the Eligible Securityholders of at least 10,000 Escrow Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, no permitted delay in delivering the notice to the Escrow Agent with respect to a delivery of Escrow Shares to the Eligible Securityholders shall result in a delay in delivery of notice to the Escrow Agent to pay such amounts as are payable to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to the resolution of the applicable Unsatisfied Claim, if any. 

  

 (e) As soon as all Unsatisfied Claims are resolved, the Stockholder Agent and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly (and in no event later than five Business Days after the date of such written notice) deliver to each Eligible Securityholder, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions, the remaining Escrow Shares held to satisfy such Claimed Amounts after payment of all Agreed Amounts (such date, the "Final Distribution Date"). Escrow Shares that are not distributed as of the Expiration Date because of an Unsatisfied Claim may not be used to pay for Losses arising from any Unsatisfied Claim other than the Unsatisfied Claim originally asserted in the relevant Claim Certificate delivered to the Stockholder Agent prior to the Expiration Date (including any supplement delivered prior to such date). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) If any Earn Out Shares are (i) distributable on or before the Expiration Date, the applicable Earn Out Escrow Shares shall, concurrent with such distribution of Earn Out Shares, be deposited with the Escrow Agent, and (ii) distributable after the Expiration Date, and (A) there are no Unsatisfied Claims, the applicable Earn Out Escrow Shares shall be distributed to the Eligible Securityholders in accordance with _Section 1.11(b)_, concurrent with the distribution of such Earn Out Shares, and (B) there are Unsatisfied Claims, the applicable Earn Out Escrow Shares shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent to be available for any payment of any Unsatisfied Claims as of such date upon resolution thereof, and after payment of all Agreed Amounts relating to such Unsatisfied Claims, distributed as set forth in _Section 7.6(e)_ above. 

  

 7.7 _Stockholder Agent_. 

  

 (a) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company Securityholders (other than those holding Dissenting Shares), by the requisite approval and adoption of this Agreement, and the Founders exercise of the drag along rights in ARTICLE V, Section 4(a) of the Companys certificate of incorporation, irrevocably appoint the Stockholder Agent as their agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Company Securityholder, in connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Stockholder Agent is authorized: (i) to take all action necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which Parent or any other Indemnified Party may seek indemnity pursuant to this _Article VII_, (ii) to prosecute on behalf of the Company Securityholders indemnification claims against Parent or the Surviving Company under this _Article VII,_ (iii) to give and receive all notices required to be given under this Agreement, and (iv) to take any and all additional action as is contemplated to be taken by the Stockholder Agent or by or on behalf of the Company Securityholders by the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the powers conferred above shall not authorize or empower the Stockholder Agent to do or cause to be done any of the foregoing in a manner that improperly discriminates between or among the Company Securityholders, and provided further that the Stockholder Agent shall not be entitled to, and shall not, take any action that would or could (x) cause any Company Securityholder to have any liability hereunder whatsoever in excess of the Escrow Fund, (y) result in the amounts payable hereunder to any Company Securityholder being distributed in any manner other than as set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or (z) result in any Company Securityholder having any indemnity or other obligations or liabilities under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any adverse change to the nature of the indemnity obligations), in excess of those set forth in this _Article VII_, without (in each case) such Company Securityholders prior written consent. 

  

 (b) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, all decisions and actions by the Stockholder Agent, including, without limitation, any agreement between the Stockholder Agent and Parent relating to (i) the defense or settlement of any claims for which any Indemnifying Parties may be required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party or Parties pursuant to this _Article VII_, or (ii) the defense or settlement of any claims for which any Indemnifying Parties may be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party or Parties pursuant to this _Article VII_, shall be binding upon all of the applicable Indemnifying Parties, and subject to _Section 7.7(a)_, no Company Securityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The Stockholder Agent shall not have any liability to any of the Company Securityholders for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. 

  

 (d) To enable the Stockholder Agent to perform its duties hereunder, at the Closing, the Stockholder Fund Escrow Shares shall be placed into escrow pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ for the sole use of the Stockholder Agent (the "Stockholder Agent Fund"), with any remaining shares distributable to the Eligible Stockholders on or before the Final Distribution Date. The Stockholder Agent shall be entitled to be paid from the amounts at any time remaining in the Stockholder Agent Fund for (i) all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys fees, accountants fees, travel expenses, telephone and facsimile transmission costs, postage, copying charges and the like in connection with or arising out of the performance of its duties as Stockholder Agent, and (ii) indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Stockholder Agent (except for those arising out of the Stockholder Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the Stockholder Agent Fund is exhausted, the Stockholder Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Eligible Securityholders, in his capacity as the Stockholder Agent pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Stockholder Agent in such capacity, and for indemnification by the Eligible Securityholders against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Stockholder Agent (except for those arising out of the Stockholder Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of claims. Such reimbursement and indemnification obligations to the Stockholder Agent shall be joint and several. As among the Eligible Securityholders, reimbursement or indemnification obligations shall be paid pro rata based upon the amounts that such Eligible Securityholders would be entitled to upon a distribution of the Escrow Shares and Earn Out Shares in accordance with _Section 1.7(a)_,  _Section 1.7(d)(i)_ and other applicable provisions of _Article I_. Prior to any distribution of Earn Out Shares to Eligible Securityholders, Earn Out Shares shall be first paid to the Stockholder Agent to the extent that at such time the Stockholder Agent has unreimbursed expenses, disbursements or advances, or unindemnified losses, liabilities or expenses, such number of shares to be based on the closing price of shares of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the trading day prior to such distribution. Within 45 days after the earlier of (i) the exhaustion of the Stockholder Agent Fund, or (ii) the completion of the Stockholder Agents responsibilities under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Agent shall prepare and make available to the Eligible Securityholders upon request an accounting of the uses of the Stockholder Agent Fund. To the extent not exhausted upon the completion of the Stockholder Agents responsibilities under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Agent Fund shall be distributed by the Exchange Agent in accordance with _Section 1.11(b)_. 

  

 (e) To the fullest extent permitted by Law and as a result of exercise of the drag along rights under ARTICLE V, Section 4 of the Companys certificate of incorporation, the Stockholder Agent shall have full power and authority on behalf of each Company Securityholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all instruments on behalf 

   ##### 

  

 

of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the Company Securityholders
under this  _Article VII_. 

   

 (f) Subject to applicable Law, by his, her or its approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and as a result of exercise of the drag along rights under ARTICLE V, Section 4 of the Companys certificate of incorporation, each Company Securityholder agrees, in addition to the foregoing, that: 

   

 (i) Parent and any other Indemnified Party shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Stockholder Agent as to (A) the settlement of any claims for indemnification by Parent or such Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VII_ , (B) the settlement of any claims for indemnification by any Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VII_, or (C) any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the Stockholder Agent hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, and no Company Securityholder or Seller Indemnified Party shall have any cause of action against Parent or such Indemnified Party for any action taken by Parent or such Indemnified Party in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Stockholder Agent; 

   

 (ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Stockholder Agent shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Company Securityholders and the Seller Indemnified Parties and no Company Securityholder or Seller Indemnified Party shall have any cause of action against the Stockholder Agent for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Stockholder Agent under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except for fraud or willful misconduct by the Stockholder Agent in connection with the matters described in this _Section 7.7_; 

   

 (iii) the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Securityholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

   

 (iv) remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are inadequate; therefore, Parent shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages if Parent brings an action to enforce the provisions of this _Section 7.7_. 

  

 (g) The individual serving as the Stockholder Agent may resign upon no less than thirty days prior written notice to Parent, the Escrow Agent and each Company Securityholder (other than holders of Dissenting Shares). In the event of the death or permanent disability of the then Stockholder Agent, or if the then-acting Stockholder Agent shall give notice of intent to resign, the holders of a majority in interest of Company Capital Stock (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by written notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent, appoint a successor Stockholder Agent as soon as practicable, and in no event later than thirty days following such death, permanent disability or notice of intent to resign. In addition, the individual serving as the Stockholder Agent may be replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the Company 

   ##### 

  

 

Capital Stock (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time upon not less than ten days prior
written notice to Parent, the Escrow Agent and each Company Securityholder
(other than holders of only Dissenting Shares). Each successor Stockholder
Agent shall have all of the power, authority, rights and privileges conferred
by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement upon the original Stockholder
Agent, and the term "Stockholder Agent" as used herein shall be deemed to
include any such successor Stockholder Agents. 

   

 (h) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees, successors and Seller Indemnified Parties of each Company Securityholder, and any references in this Agreement to a Company Securityholder or the Company Securityholders shall mean and include the successors to the rights of the Company Securityholders hereunder (and, with respect to this _Article VII_, their Seller Indemnified Parties), whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise. 

  

 7.8 _Broadcom Litigation_. Broadcom Corporation ("Broadcom") has filed a Complaint for Patent Infringement and Demand for Jury Trial against Parent dated September 14, 2009, as amended, Case No. SA CV 09-1058 JVS (ANx) and a Complaint for Patent Infringement and Demand for Jury Trial against Parent dated May 26, 2010, Case No. CV 10-3963 JSO (FMOx) (collectively, the "Pending Actions"). In the Pending Actions, as of the date hereof, Broadcom alleges, among other things, that Parent is infringing certain patents (collectively, the "Asserted Patents"). Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.2(a)_, the Company shall not be liable for any Losses of any Parent Indemnified Party to the extent such Losses result from, relate to or arise out of Broadcom, or any successor in interest to Broadcom, asserting or establishing infringement of any of the Broadcom Related Patents in the Covered Actions, including, without limitation, as a result of which (1) the Company is in breach of or there is an inaccuracy in the Companys representations and warranties in this Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other document delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement; (2) the Companys ability to manufacture and sell its products is limited; or (3) any such assertion or determination results in and to the extent it causes the Company to breach, or otherwise gives rise to remedies under, any agreements to which the Company is a party. In addition, none of the foregoing circumstances or events, to the extent arising from Broadcom, or any successor in interest to Broadcom, asserting or establishing infringement of any of the Broadcom Related Patents in the Covered Actions, shall be considered in whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect on the Company as of the Closing Date.

This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and _Schedule 1.15_, and the Ancillary Agreements, (a) constitute the entire Agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement (which shall continue in full force and effect and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing in accordance with its terms), and (b) the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and _Schedule 1.15_, and the Support Agreements and form of Ancillary Agreements shall be deemed to have the same effect on construction or interpretation of this Agreement as if set forth herein. None of the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub, on the other, nor their respective representatives has made any representation or warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or its Subsidiaries, on the other (including, but not limited to, in each case, any relating to financial condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities, or valuations), except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 9.3 _Further Assurances; Subsequent Actions_. At any time or from time to time after the Closing, each of the parties shall execute and deliver to any of the other parties such other documents and instruments, provide such materials and information and take such other actions as the other party may reasonably request to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to cause the other party to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 9.4 _Amendment; Waiver_. 

  

 (a) Except as is otherwise required by applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) that the consent of the Stockholder Agent shall not be required in connection with any amendment to this Agreement that does not affect the rights and obligations of the Stockholder Agent (or any of the holders of Company Capital Stock or Company Options who are represented by the Stockholder Agent), and (ii) after the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement, such amendment shall be approved by the stockholders of the Company to the extent required by the DGCL and, to the extent applicable, the California Code. 

  

 (b) Except for matters addressed in _Section 8.3_, any other term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. Except as expressly set forth in such waiver, no waiver by any party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative and not alternative. 

  

 9.5 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors or permitted 

   ##### 

  

 

assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to confer third-party
beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer any such rights, upon
any other Person, including any employee or former employee of the Company
(or any beneficiary or dependent thereof), other than (i) any Parent
Indemnified Party expressly entitled to indemnity under _Article VII_, and
then solely with respect to indemnification thereunder, (ii) as provided in
_Section 5.11_ (which is intended for the benefit of the former and current
employees, agents, directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
all of whom shall be third party beneficiaries of such provision), (iii) as
provided in _Section 5.26_ and _Section 5.27_ (which are intended for
the benefit of parties named therein, all of whom shall be third party
beneficiaries of such provisions), and (iv) as provided in _Section 7.3_,
and then solely with respect to indemnification thereunder (which is intended
for the benefit of the Company Securityholders, all of whom shall be third
party beneficiaries of such Section), provided that any claim or action
by the Company Securityholders under _Section 7.3_ and this clause (iv)
shall be prosecuted exclusively by the Stockholder Agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _Section 9.5_ shall not be construed to prohibit an action
(i) for payment of Merger consideration by a Company Stockholder or holder of
a Company Option or Substituted Parent Option that is unpaid at a time when
Parent is then obligated to pay such amounts or (ii) to enforce the vesting
and exercisability rights of a Terminated Company Employee with respect to
his or her Unvested Substituted Parent Options, in each case, pursuant to
_Article I_. 

   

 9.6 _No Assignment; Binding Effect_. Except in the case of successor Stockholder Agents as permitted under _Section 7.7(f)_, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations, or those of Merger Sub, under this Agreement to any other Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company or the Stockholder Agent (which assignment shall not relieve Parent of any obligation or liability under this Agreement). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 9.7 _Headings_. The headings and table of contents used in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not and shall not be deemed to define or limit the provisions hereof. 

  

 9.8 _Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the rights or obligations of each party hereto under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible. 

  

 9.9 _Governing Law, Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, and where expressly set 

   ##### 

  

 

forth in this Agreement, the laws of the State of California, regardless of
the Laws or rules that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of Laws thereof. In the event of the bringing of any action or suit
by a party hereto against another party hereunder arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, which claim or suit is not subject to arbitration, as
determined pursuant to _Section 9.14_, then in that event, the sole forum
for resolving such disputes shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or the federal courts in such state, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to such exclusive jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, if any dispute, claim or controversy arising
out of or relating to this Agreement arises at the same time and relates to
the same or similar facts, claims or events as any one or more other
disputes, claims or controversies subject to arbitration pursuant to _Section
9.14_, such disputes, claims or controversies, shall, to the
extent practicable, be combined in one proceeding under this _Section 9.9_,
and in such event, the provisions of this section governing dispute
resolution shall supersede any other provisions relating to such matters in
this Agreement. This _Section 9.9_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and the Closing. 

   

 9.10 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREFROM, THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING (INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM) BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY HERETO AGAINST ANY OTHER OR THEIR SUCCESSORS IN RESPECT OF ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION OR PROCEEDING. 

  

 9.11 _Construction_. This Agreement is the product of negotiation between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of whom were represented by counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity to participate in and did participate in, the drafting of each provision hereof. Accordingly, ambiguities in this Agreement, if any, shall not be construed strictly or in favor of or against any party hereto but rather shall be given a fair and reasonable construction without regard to the rule of _contra proferentem_. 

  

 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Notwithstanding _Section 9.9_, the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity; provided, that after termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, the parties shall only be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief with respect to those provisions that expressly survive such termination as set forth in _Section 8.2_. Nothing in _Article VII_ shall be construed or interpreted to limit the provisions of this _Section 9.13_. 

  

 9.14 _Arbitration_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (i) the calculation of the Merger consideration payable by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Article I,_ or (ii) any claim pursuant to the provisions of _Article VII_, including the applicability and application of such provisions to such dispute, claim or controversy, shall be determined by arbitration in Orange County, California before a sole arbitrator; _provided_ , _however_ , if the claim and any counterclaim, in the aggregate, exceed $750,000, exclusive of interest and attorneys fees, the dispute shall be heard and determined by three arbitrators as provided herein. If any such dispute, claim or controversy arises at the same time and relates to the same or similar facts, claims or events as any one or more other disputes, claims or controversies subject to arbitration pursuant to this _Section 9.14_, such disputes, claims or controversies, shall, to the extent practicable, be combined in one arbitration proceeding under this _Section 9.14_, and in such event, the provisions of this section governing dispute resolution shall supersede any other provisions relating to such matters in this Agreement; if such claims are joined, all claims shall be aggregated for purposes for determining the number of arbitrators. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to proceeding with arbitration of any dispute, claim or controversy required to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to this _Section 9.14_, if any dispute, claim or controversy arises out of or relates to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the parties shall first try to resolve their dispute through informal and good faith negotiation between an authorized officer of the Company (or, after the Closing, the Stockholder Agent) and an authorized officer of Parent, with authority to settle such dispute claim or controversy, before resorting to arbitration. Such persons shall meet for the purpose of endeavoring to resolve such dispute, claim or controversy within ten Business Days after a written request from either the Company (or, after the Closing, the Stockholder Agent) or Parent to the other. Such representatives shall discuss the problem and negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute promptly and without the necessity of any formal arbitration proceeding relating thereto. The location, format and duration (not to exceed three Business Days, unless mutually agreed by such representatives) of these negotiations shall be left to the discretion of the representatives involved. If such negotiations do not lead to resolution of the underlying dispute, claim or controversy to the satisfaction of any party, then any party may provide notice of the election to pursue resolution by arbitration as set forth herein. 

  

 (c) The arbitration shall be conducted by JAMS pursuant to the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of JAMS. All arbitrators shall be retired or former district court or appellate court judges of any United States District Court or United States Court of Appeals, or such other person with such other qualifications as Parent and the Company (or, after the Closing, the Stockholder Agent) may agree, and shall be selected within seven Business Days after receipt of notice from one party to another that it intends to seek arbitration hereunder. The Federal Rules of Evidence shall govern the admissibility of evidence during the arbitration. Subject to _Section 9.15_, the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing partys actual damages, except as may be authorized by Law. The determination of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on the parties and a judgment on such award or determination may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction and such judgment shall be final and non-appealable. The decision and award of the arbitrator(s) shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. 

   ##### 

  

  

 9.15 _Payment of Fees and Expenses_. In any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including arbitration pursuant to  _Section 9.14_, the prevailing party will be entitled to reasonable fees of attorneys, accountants, and other professionals, and other reasonable costs and expenses in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled. 

  

 9.16 _Time is of Essence_. Time is of the essence with regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement. 

  

 9.17 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule or in this Agreement, the information and disclosures contained in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule as though fully set forth in such Section for which applicability of such information and disclosure is readily apparent on its face. The inclusion of any information in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or updated or supplemented Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgement by the Company that such information is material to or outside the ordinary course of its business. Certain information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules is intended solely for informational purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to the Agreement, and the listing of an item does not necessarily mean that the Company has made a judgment that such information is material or that any possible adverse result will occur.
