Stockholder Fund Escrow Shares shall be placed into escrow pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(b)</U> for
the sole use of the Stockholder Agent (the &#147;<B>Stockholder Agent Fund</B>&#148;), with any remaining shares
distributable to the Eligible Stockholders on or before the Final Distribution Date. The
Stockholder Agent shall be entitled to be paid from the amounts at any time remaining in the
Stockholder Agent Fund for (i)&nbsp;all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys&#146;
fees, accountants fees, travel expenses, telephone and facsimile transmission costs, postage,

actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Stockholder Agent (except for those
arising out of the Stockholder Agent&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs

is exhausted, the Stockholder Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Eligible

willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of claims. Such
reimbursement and indemnification obligations to the Stockholder Agent shall be joint and several.
As among the Eligible Securityholders, reimbursement or indemnification obligations shall be paid
pro rata based upon the amounts that such Eligible Securityholders would be entitled to upon a
distribution of the Escrow Shares and Earn Out Shares in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;1.7(a)</U>,
<U>Section&nbsp;1.7(d)(i)</U> and other applicable provisions of <U>Article&nbsp;I</U>. Prior to any

the Stockholder Agent to the extent that at such time the Stockholder Agent has unreimbursed
expenses, disbursements or advances, or unindemnified losses, liabilities or expenses, such number
of shares to be based on the closing price of shares of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the
trading day prior to such distribution. Within 45&nbsp;days after the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the exhaustion of
the Stockholder Agent Fund, or (ii)&nbsp;the completion of the Stockholder Agent&#146;s responsibilities

Agreement, the parties shall first try to resolve their dispute through informal and good faith
negotiation between an authorized officer of the Company (or, after the Closing, the Stockholder

controversy, before resorting to arbitration. Such persons shall meet for the purpose of
endeavoring to resolve such dispute, claim or controversy within ten Business Days after a written
request from either the Company (or, after the Closing, the Stockholder Agent) or Parent to the

resolve the dispute promptly and without the necessity of any formal arbitration proceeding
relating thereto. The location, format and duration (not to exceed three Business Days, unless
mutually agreed by such representatives) of these negotiations shall be left to the discretion of
the representatives involved. If such negotiations do not lead to resolution of the underlying
