exist immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Purchased Assets_
"), including the following:

(d) all rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries to assert any attorney-
client privilege and attorney work product protection of the Company and its
Subsidiaries associated with the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities;
and

(e) the amount, if any, that the cash and cash equivalents of the Company
upon the Closing exceeds the Cash and Cash Equivalents (which amount, if any,
shall be remitted to Parent within three (3) Business Days following the
Closing to an account specified by Parent).

 

Section 1.03 _Excluded Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, all cash and cash equivalents in accounts owned
by the Company as of 11:59 p.m. on April 3, 2015 (which amount includes the

_Cash and Cash Equivalents_ ") shall be retained by the Company, and shall be
excluded from the Purchased Assets (collectively, the " _Excluded Assets_ ").

Section 1.04  _Assumed Liabilities_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and subject to the exclusions set forth
in _Section 1.05_, HLSS MSR-EBO

 



2  (solely with respect to the Company Promissory Note and not with respect to
any other Assumed Liabilities) and HLSS Advances (with respect to all Assumed
Liabilities other than the Company Promissory Note) each hereby agree,
effective at the time of the Closing, to (as applicable) assume and thereafter
timely to pay, discharge and perform in accordance with their terms, all
liabilities of the Company (except for the Excluded Liabilities),
irrespective of whether accruing before, on or after the Closing Date, whether
known or unknown, fixed or contingent, asserted or unasserted, and not
satisfied or extinguished as of the Closing Date (the " _Assumed Liabilities_
"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following shall be
included among the Assumed Liabilities:

 

(a) all liabilities arising under any of the Assumed Contracts;

 

(b) all liabilities with respect to any litigation, suit, action, arbitration
or other proceeding whether or not related to the ownership of the Purchased

(e) all Assumed Taxes;

 

(f) the Company Promissory Note; and

 

(g) all amounts relating to Post-Closing Liabilities in excess of $50,000,000.

 

Section 1.05 _Excluded Liabilities_. None of the Buyer Parties are assuming or
agreeing to pay or discharge any of the following liabilities of the Company
(the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "), notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement: amounts relating to Post-Closing Liabilities up to an aggregate
amount of $50,000,000 (it being agreed that the Buyers shall not have any
obligation in respect of Post-Closing Liabilities unless and until such time
that the Company has actually paid an aggregate of $50,000,000 in respect of
Post-Closing Liabilities, and in such case, any Post-Closing Liabilities
in excess of such amount shall be assumed by HLSS Advances pursuant to
_Section 1.04(g)_).

Section 1.06 _Assignment of Certain Purchased Assets_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to convey, assign, transfer or deliver to the
applicable Buyer any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted conveyance,
assignment, transfer or delivery thereof, or an agreement to do any of the
foregoing, without the consent of a third party (including any
Governmental Entity), would constitute a breach or other contravention
thereof or a violation of Law or would in any way adversely affect the rights
of the applicable Buyer (as assignee or transferee of the Company, or
otherwise) thereto or thereunder. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consent necessary for the conveyance, assignment,
transfer or delivery of any such Purchased Asset, claim, right or benefit to
the applicable Buyer. If, on the Closing Date, any such consent is not
obtained, or if an attempted conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery
thereof or performance thereof by the

 



3  applicable Buyer would be ineffective or a violation of Law or would
adversely affect the rights of the applicable Buyer thereto or thereunder so
that the applicable Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, the
Company and the applicable Buyer will cooperate in a mutually acceptable
arrangement under which the applicable Buyer would, in compliance with Law,
obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens
associated with such Purchased Asset, claim, right or benefit in accordance
with this Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to
the applicable Buyer, or under which the Company would enforce for the benefit
(and at the expense) of the applicable Buyer its rights against a third party
(including any Governmental Entity) associated with such Purchased Asset,
claim, right or benefit, and the Company would promptly pay to the applicable
Buyer when received all monies received by them under any such Purchased
Asset, claim, right or benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
Purchased Asset shall be conveyed, assigned, transferred and delivered to the
applicable Buyer upon receipt of the requisite consent unless such attempted
contribution, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery thereof would be
ineffective or a violation of Law or would adversely affect the rights of the
applicable Buyer.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYERS

 

Each Buyer Party represents and warrants, with respect to such Buyer Party, to
the Company that the statements contained in this _Article III_ are true and
correct except (i) as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents (including any
amendments thereto) filed and publicly available after January 1, 2014 and
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Parent SEC Documents_ ")
(provided that nothing disclosed in such Filed Parent SEC Documents shall be
deemed to be a qualification of or modification to the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.01_, _Section 3.02_,  _Section 3.03_
and _Section 3.06_), excluding any disclosures in the Filed Parent SEC
Documents under the headings "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" or
any other disclosures or risks therein to the extent that such disclosures
are similarly cautionary, non-specific, predictive or forward-looking in
nature, or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Buyer
Parties to the Company at or before the execution and delivery by the Buyer
Parties of this Agreement (the " _Buyer Disclosure Letter_ "). The Buyer
Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this 
_Article III_ , and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify
any other section in this _Article III_ to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosures that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other section.

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Such Buyer Party is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all corporate or other
similar power and authority required to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to consummate the Transactions and to perform its obligations hereunder.
Such Buyer Party is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Such Buyer
Party has made available to the Company, prior to execution of this Agreement
(or promptly hereafter shall make available) true and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation (or similar organizational document) of such
Buyer Party in effect as of the date of this Agreement and the by-laws (or
similar organizational document) of such Buyer Party in effect as of the date
of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Such Buyer
Party has all requisite corporate or other similar power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder to consummate the
Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction
Documents. Such Buyer Party Board has adopted resolutions, by unanimous vote
of the

 



6  directors present at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors
(or similar) of such Buyer Party was present, (i) approving the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and (ii) determining that entering into this Agreement is in the
best interests of such Buyer Party and its stockholders. As of the date of
this Agreement, such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. No other
corporate action on the part of such Buyer Party is necessary, to authorize,
adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents or to consummate the Transactions or the transactions
contemplated by the other Transaction Documents. Such Buyer Party has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement and the parties (other than such Buyer Party or its
Subsidiaries) to the other Transaction Documents, constitute its legal, valid
and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms
except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity.

 

Section 3.03 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery by such Buyer Party of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents does not, and the performance by such Buyer Party
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the
Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction
Documents will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, any
obligation to make an offer to purchase or redeem any Indebtedness or share
capital or any loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of
any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of such Buyer Party under, any
provision of (i) the governing or organizational documents of such Buyer
Party, (ii) any contract, lease, license, indenture, note, bond, agreement,

that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure at the applicable
Buyer Partys prior written request and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall not be required to pay any fee, penalty or other consideration
to any such third party to obtain their consent), (ii) result in the loss of
any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of
it as possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege), or (iii) violate any Law ( _provided_ that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in
a manner that does not violate Law). Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide
any access or make any disclosure to the Buyers pursuant to this _Section
5.01(a)_ to the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to
a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any of the Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
are adverse parties.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Company shall hold, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to hold, in
confidence and not to disclose to any other party, and not to use for any
purpose other than as expressly required by Law or by this Agreement or the
New Merger Agreement, or in connection with reporting Tax information to
the Companys shareholders, any and all information, whether written or oral,
concerning the business of Luxco 1A, Luxco 1B, the Transferred Subsidiaries,
the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, except to the extent that
the Company can show that such information (a) is generally available to and
known by the public through no fault of any of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives (or Representatives of
their respective Subsidiaries); or (b) is lawfully acquired by any of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
from and after the Closing from sources which are not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation.
If any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives

 



27  are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of Law, the Company shall promptly notify the
Buyer Parties in writing, and the Company shall disclose only that portion of
such information which the Company is advised by its counsel in writing is
legally required to be disclosed, provided that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, at the Buyer Parties sole expense, to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

 

Section 5.02 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided
in the respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company Subsidiaries and any
indemnification or other similar agreements of any of the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the Closing Date, shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. From and after the
Closing, Parent agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Closing, a director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
thereafter commences prior to the Closing, serving at the request of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another
Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing (including this Agreement and
the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer
or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer
of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, each Company Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding from Parent within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt by Parent from the Company Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; _provided_  that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the organizational
documents of Parent, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by
final adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any claim is brought against
any Company Indemnified Party, (x) Parent shall have the right to assume or
direct any of its Subsidiaries to assume the defense thereof with legal
counsel of Parents choosing, and if Parent shall assume or direct any of its
Subsidiaries to assume the defense, then Parent or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall not be liable to such Company Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Company Indemnified Party may employ counsel of its own
choosing, and Parent or such Subsidiary, as applicable, shall advance to such
Company Indemnified Party reasonable legal expenses of such counsel, if (i)
Parent does not timely assume the defense thereof or (ii) under 

 



28  applicable standards of professional conduct there is an actual or potential
conflict of interest between the legal defenses for Parent (or the Subsidiary)
and those for the Company Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of
an action; (y) the Company Indemnified Party shall cooperate with Parent or
such Subsidiary, as applicable, in the defense of any such matter; and (z)
Parent or such Subsidiary, as applicable, shall not be liable for any
settlement of any claim effected without its written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld).

(b) In the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.02_. 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance for the Company and its current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, in either
case, of not less than the coverage existing as of the Closing Date and having
other terms substantially equivalent to the directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage maintained by the
Company as of the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Closing, except that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay, with respect to such insurance policies in
respect of any one policy year, more than 150% of the aggregate annual
premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the Closing Date (which
amount is set forth in _Section 5.02(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter)
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if Parent is unable to obtain (or to cause to
be obtained) the insurance required by this _Section 5.02_ it shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six (6) year
period for an aggregate annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in
respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance,
Parent may, at its option (following reasonable consultation with the
Company), purchase (through or for the Company, as applicable) a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy for a period of six (6)
years from and after the Closing for the Company and its current and former
directors and officers who are covered by the directors and officers
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage maintained by the Company
as of the Closing Date, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less
than such coverage and to have other terms substantially equivalent to the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage maintained by the Company as of the Closing Date with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing;
_provided_ that in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy exceed the
Maximum Amount. In the event the Company purchases such tail coverage, Parent
shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
5.02(c)_. Parent shall maintain such policies in full force and effect during
the period of insurance, and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.02_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Transactions, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights

 



29  to insurance indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding that the Seller Indemnified
Parties may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to one or more provisions
under this Agreement, the New Merger Agreement or otherwise, in no event shall
any such Company Indemnified Party be entitled to be recover more than once in
respect of the same claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines, fees, cost or expenses.

Section 5.03 _Litigation; Other Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Buyers shall defend and assume control
over and bear all responsibility in respect of any litigation, suit, action,
claim, demand, investigation or other proceedings, and any settlement or
compromise thereof against or involving the Company, any Company Subsidiary
and/or any of their respective officers or directors (in their capacity as
such), including any litigation, suit, action, claim, demand, investigation
or other proceedings by any shareholder of the Company (on its own behalf or
on behalf of the Company) (" _Litigation_ "), (b) keep the Company
reasonably informed regarding any Litigation and (c) reasonably consult with
the Company regarding the defense and any settlement or compromise of any
Litigation and reasonably consider the Companys views with respect to any
Litigation. The Buyers shall have sole control over the use, invocation, or
waiver of the attorney client privilege and attorney work product doctrine; it
being further agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Buyers
and the Company shall assert and maintain the common interest, joint defense
or other privilege or immunity over communications between the Buyers and the
Company.

(b) The Company shall (a) give prompt written notice to the Buyers of any
material written communications (and shall deliver copies thereof) received
from, or delivered to, any shareholders of the Company or any Related Person
or the Companys auditors or any Governmental Entity and (b) reasonably
consult with the Buyers in connection with the foregoing.

Section 5.04  _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any dispute
between the parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, the Buyer
Parties and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or
other public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude, after
consultation with legal counsel, is required by applicable Law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system (in which case
the disclosing party shall consult with the other party in advance of such
disclosure to the extent practicable under the circumstances). The Company and
each of the Buyer Parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties. Nothing in this _Section 5.04_ shall limit the ability of any
party hereto to make additional disclosures that are consistent in all but de
minimis respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the
Transactions.

undertaking to amend, any benefit plan. The provisions of this _Section 5.05_
are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and

employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any
nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right in any employee or
beneficiary of such employee or other Person under a Company Benefit Plan that

third party to such access or disclosure at the Companys prior written
request and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the applicable Buyer shall not be
required to pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any such third
party to obtain their consent), (ii) result in the loss of any attorney-client

confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

Section 8.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof, except that the fiduciary
or other duties of the Company Board arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance
with the Laws of the Cayman Islands.

Section 8.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_  that any of the
rights, interests and obligations of each Buyer Party may be assigned to any
Affiliate of such Buyer Party, provided that no such assignment shall relieve
the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



47 Section 8.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Venue_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would __occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. It is agreed that the parties are entitled to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in clause (a) below, without proof of actual damages (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or the Transactions or the transaction contemplated by the
Transaction Documents in any court other than the aforesaid courts.

 

Section 8.11 _Certain Tax Matters_. __

 

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
each Buyer shall be permitted, in its sole discretion and to the extent
permitted by law, to make elections under Section 338(g) of the Code with
respect to any Company Subsidiary. In the event that a Buyer intends to make
an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any of the
Company Subsidiaries, Parent or that Buyer shall notify the Company of its
intent to make such election(s) within a reasonable time thereafter.

 

(b) Following the Closing, the Buyers shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to
provide to the Company, for each taxable period that ends on or before or
includes the Closing Date, such tax information and representations (including
such information and representations as are required to be set forth in a PFIC
Annual Information Statement pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1295-1(g)) as is necessary to enable the Company to provide the holders of
its ordinary shares with such tax information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as is consistent with the past practice of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including information and
representations to allow such holders to make or maintain a "qualified
electing fund" election under Section 1295 of the Code; _provided_ , that the
Buyers obligation under this _Section 8.11(b)_ to provide tax information
and representations with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
is limited to such information that is reasonably available to the Buyers or
the Company Subsidiaries. 

(c)

 



48 (i) Subject to _Section 8.11(c)(ii)_, no later than sixty (60) Business Days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Company a
draft of an allocation of the Aggregate Consideration and Assumed Liabilities
among the Purchased Assets and Luxco 1A Shares in a manner consistent with
Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Allocation_ ") for the Companys review and approval.
Within thirty (30) days of the Companys receipt of the draft Allocation, the
Company shall notify Parent in writing of any objections to the draft
Allocation, in which case Parent and the Company shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any disputed items. If Parent and the Company are not able to
resolve any such disputed items, within thirty (30) days of such notice, an
accounting firm of national standing mutually acceptable to Parent and the
Company (the " _Tax Referee_ ") shall determine the appropriate allocation and
revise the Allocation accordingly. If the Company does not respond within
thirty (30) days of its initial receipt of the draft Allocation, or upon
resolution of the disputed items, the Allocation, as amended for any such
resolution, shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. Parent, the
Company and their respective Affiliates shall report consistently with the
final Allocation in all income Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594, and
Parent and the Company shall timely file such Tax Returns, and none of
Parent, the Company, or their respective Affiliates shall take any position in
any income Tax Return that is inconsistent with any such final Allocation
unless required to do so by final determination as defined in Section 1313
of the Code. Each of Parent, the Company and their respective Affiliates
shall promptly advise the others regarding the existence of any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation related to the agreed Allocation.

 

(ii) Without limiting _Section 8.11(c)(i)_, (i) the NRZ Shares, and the
Assumed Liabilities (other than the Company Promissory Note), shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Tax law, be allocated to the Luxco 1A Shares
(in addition to any additional cash allocated to the Luxco 1A Shares under
_Section 8.11(c)(i)_), and (ii) the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts and shall reasonably cooperate to determine a final
Allocation as soon as reasonably practicable following Closing.

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including
access to books and records) and assistance relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for the making of an election
under Section 338(g) of the Code, the filing of any Tax Return, the
preparation for any Tax audit and the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment in respect of Taxes.
Parent and the Company, and their Affiliates, shall retain or cause to be
retained all books and records pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries
until the expiration of the applicable period for assessment under applicable
Law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) and shall abide by or
cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority.

(e) The Company shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Parent (or, at
Parents direction, any Buyer or Company Subsidiary) all refunds of Taxes and
interest thereon received by the Company from a taxing authority to the extent
such refunds constitute Purchased Assets or relate to any Taxes that
constitute (or, had they been owed, would have constituted) Assumed Taxes.

 



49 (f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar Taxes and similar charges incurred in connection with transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne and paid by the Buyers. Parent
and the Company shall cooperate to file or cause to be filed all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and charges.

(g) If the Company becomes aware of any claim, demand, audit, suit, action,
litigation or proceeding for or with respect to any Tax that is or could be
an Assumed Tax (a " _Tax Contest_ "), the Company shall reasonably promptly
notify Parent of such Tax Contest and shall give Parent such information with
respect thereto as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to so notify Parent shall not preclude any Seller Indemnified
Party from any indemnification which it may claim in accordance with Article
VI, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
thereby. Parent may participate (or cause a Buyer to participate) in and, upon
notice to the Company, assume the defense of any Tax Contest (or, to the
extent Parent or such Buyer is not permitted by law to participate in or
assume the defense of any Tax Contest, Parent or such Buyer shall have the
right to direct the Company in the defense of such Tax Contest, which
directions the Company shall follow). If Parent or a Buyer assumes such
defense, Parent or such Buyer shall have the sole discretion as to the
conduct of such defense (including the right to settle, or to direct the
Company to settle, such Tax Contest on any terms Parent or such Buyer
determines in its discretion). Regardless of whether Parent or a Buyer
assumes the defense of any Tax Contest, Parent or a Buyer shall bear the costs
and expenses attributable to all Tax Contests.

 

(h) Except as required by applicable Laws, without the prior written consent
of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed), the Company shall not amend any Tax Return if such Tax Return
relates to any Taxes that are or could be Assumed Taxes.

 

(i) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns with
respect to the Company, which shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice. At least forty (40) days prior to the due date (taking to
account applicable extensions) for any such Tax Return that relates to any
Taxes that are or could be Assumed Taxes, the Company shall provide such
Tax Return to Parent for its review and comment, and the Company shall accept
any comments to such Tax Return made by Parent in good faith within twenty-
five (25) days following the Parents receipt of such Tax Return.

 

(j) The covenants and agreements of this _Section 8.11_ shall survive the
Closing indefinitely.

 

Section 8.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT __PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE
OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR

 



50  OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (C) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section 8.12_. __________________
