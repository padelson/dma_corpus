(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 5.3(f)_, if any

based Award and (B) the Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment; or (ii) be converted into the

5.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_, the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for Shares shall have been changed into a different number
of Shares or securities, or a different class, by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of
Shares and Company Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing in this _Section 5.5_
shall be construed to permit the Constituent Entities or their respective
Subsidiaries to take any action otherwise prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

(i) _Employee Benefits and Employment Matters_.

 



 

(i) Section 6.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Benefit Plans
which are (A) sponsored, contributed to, or maintained by any Acquired Company
and which are provided to or for the benefit of any Persons that are employed
by or provide services to any Acquired Company or (B) for which any Acquired
Company has any Liability (actual or contingent) (each such Benefit Plan, a "
**Company Benefit Plan** "). Section 6.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
separately identifies each Company Benefit Plan which is maintained outside of
the United States primarily for the benefit of employees situated outside of
the United States (each such Company Benefit Plan, a " **Company Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan** "). The Company has made available to Parent, with respect to
each Company Benefit Plan and to each material Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
(to the extent applicable thereto), true, correct and complete copies of (i)
such plan and all amendments thereto; (ii) the most recently filed Forms 5500
and all schedules and attachments thereto; (iii) the most recent summary plan
description, and all summaries of material modifications related thereto,
distributed with respect to such Company Benefit Plan; (iv) the most recent
determination, opinion or advisory letter issued by the IRS with respect to
such Company Benefit Plan; (v) all related trust agreements, insurance
contracts, and other funding arrangements; (vi) all

 



      
 

 



 

written summaries of all non-written Company Benefit Plans; (vii) copies of
applicable discrimination and compliance testing for the last two years; and
(viii) any material, non-routine communications from a Governmental Entity
within the last two years.

 



 

(ii) All contributions (including employee contributions to any qualified
plan), insurance premiums, or other payments with respect to the Company
Benefit Plans for all periods ending prior to the date hereof have been timely
made by the Acquired Companies, and for periods ending prior to Closing will
be timely made prior to Closing by the Acquired Companies or properly accrued,
as applicable, in accordance with past practice.

 



 

(iii) Except with respect to any Company Benefit Plan which is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA and which
is set forth in Section 6.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a "
**Multiemployer Plan** "), none of the Acquired Companies in the past six
years has sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or been obligated to
contribute to any "employee benefit plan" which is subject to the provisions
of Title IV of ERISA. Neither any Acquired Company nor any of their ERISA
Affiliates have engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or
Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

 



 

(iv) With respect to each Multiemployer Plan: (A) all contributions required
to be made by any Acquired Company or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
to any such plan have been timely made, (B) none of the Acquired Companies or
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal Liability
under Title IV of ERISA which remains unsatisfied or would be subject to
withdrawal Liability if, as of the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies, any
of its subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates were to engage
in a complete withdrawal (as defined in Section 4203 of ERISA) or partial
withdrawal (as defined in Section 4205 of ERISA) from any Multiemployer Plan,
(C) no Multiemployer Plan is in "reorganization" or "insolvent" (as those
terms are defined in Sections 4241 and 4245 of ERISA, respectively) or has
been determined to be in "endangered" or "critical" status, within the meaning
of Section 432 of the Code or Section 305 or Title IV of ERISA, and (D) the
Company has provided a copy of the notice under Section 101(l) of ERISA
pertaining to its estimated withdrawal Liability under Title IV of ERISA for
the most recently completed plan year.

 



 

(v) Except as set forth in Section 6.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Acquired Company has any obligation to provide life, medical or other
welfare benefits to former or retired employees of such Acquired Company, and
no Acquired Company has represented, promised or contracted to any employee or
former employee of any Acquired Company that such benefits would be provided,
other than under COBRA at the sole cost of such employee.

 



 

(vi) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401
of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter

 



      
 

 



 

from the IRS or has applied to the IRS for such a letter within the applicable
remedial amendment period or such period has not expired, and with respect to
such qualification, its related trust has been determined to be exempt from
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code and nothing has occurred that could
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such qualification of exempt
status. Except as set forth in Section 6.1(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded, operated, and
administered in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed
by applicable Law (including the applicable requirements of ERISA, COBRA,
HIPAA, and the Code), except where such noncompliance would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material Liability. No action, suit, investigation,
audit, proceeding, or claim (other than claims for routine benefits) is
pending against or involves or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened
against or threatened to involve, any Company Benefit Plan before any
Governmental Entity, including the Internal Revenue Service, Department of
Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, except as would not
reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability.

 



 

(vii) Except as set forth in Section 6.1(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, following the Closing, the consummation of the Merger will not (i)
entitle any current or former employee of any Acquired Company to a bonus,
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment pursuant to any
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of any compensation due to any current or former employee
of any Acquired Company, from any Acquired Company or pursuant to any Company
Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any limitation on the right of any Acquired
Company to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any
Company Benefit Plan; or (iv) give rise to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. No Acquired
Company maintains any obligations to gross-up or reimburse any individual for
any Tax under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(viii) Each Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable Laws, and, if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meets
all the requirements for such treatment. All employer and employee
contributions required by the terms of each Company Non-US Benefit Plan or by
applicable Law have been made or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with
generally accepted accounting practices in the applicable jurisdiction, and
any other payments (including insurance premiums) otherwise due in respect of
each such plan have been paid in full. The fair market value of the assets of
each funded Company NonU.S. Benefit Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all current and
former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and no transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations. Each Company Non-U.S.

 



      
 

 



 

Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been
maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

 



 

(j) _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 



 

(i) Each of the Acquired Companies is, and has at all times since January 1,
2011 been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal,
state, local or foreign Laws. None of the Acquired Companies has received any
notice from any Governmental Entity or other Person or has Knowledge of any
circumstances regarding any actual or possible material violation of, or
material failure to comply with, any Law or Order. Except with respect to
regulatory matters covered by _Section 7.5_, no investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the any Acquired Company is pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental
Entity indicated to any Acquired Company an intention to conduct the same.

 



 

(ii) Each Acquired Company has all material Governmental Authorizations
necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted, in material
compliance with all applicable Laws and Orders. Section 6.1(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists all material Governmental Authorizations held by the
Acquired Companies.

 



 

(k) _Takeover Statutes_. There are no "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover
statutes or regulations (including Section 203 of the DGCL) (each a "
**Takeover Statute** ") applicable to any Acquired Company, the Shares, the
Merger, the Support Agreements or the other Contemplated Transactions,
including any Takeover Statute that would limit or restrict Parent or any of
its Affiliates from exercising its ownership of any Shares acquired in the
Merger. No anti-takeover provision in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or other organizational documents of any Acquired Company is applicable to the
Shares, Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions. The Company Board has
taken all action so that Parent will not be prohibited from entering into a
"business combination" with the Company as an "interested stockholder" (as
such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of
this Agreement, or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

(l) _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed
since December 31, 2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise

Company or any Acquired Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Each Acquired Company, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, their
respective predecessors, have obtained and have been at all times operated,
and are in compliance with, and have made all appropriate filings for issuance
or renewal of, all material permits, licenses, authorizations, registrations,

the use, storage, treatment, transportation, release, emission and disposal of
raw materials, by-products, wastes and other substances used or produced by or
otherwise relating to the business of any Acquired Company.

 



 

(iii) None of the Acquired Companies currently or formerly owned, leased or

suits, hearings, investigations, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the any Acquired Company or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, their respective predecessors as to which any

indemnify such predecessor, that are based on or related to any Environmental
Matters or the failure to have any required Environmental Permits.

 



 

(v) There are no past or present conditions, events, circumstances, facts,
activities, practices, incidents, actions, omissions or plans (including
anticipated regulatory or legislative requirements): (A) that are reasonably
likely to give rise to any Liability under any Environmental Laws or require
any Acquired Company to incur any Environmental Costs, or (B) that are
reasonably likely to form the basis of any claim, action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation or inquiry against or involving any Acquired Company
based on or related to any Environmental Matter or that could require any
Acquired Company to incur any Environmental Costs.

 



 

(vi) None of the Acquired Companies has received any notice (written or oral)
or other communication that any of them is or may be a potentially responsible
person or otherwise liable in connection with any site allegedly containing
any Hazardous Substances, other location where there has been a release of any

injury, personal or property, from any Hazardous Substance, or notice of any
failure of any Acquired Company to comply in any material respect with any
Environmental Law or the requirements of any Environmental Permit.

 



 

(vii) None of the Acquired Companies has used any waste disposal site, or
otherwise disposed of, transported, or arranged for the transportation of, any
Hazardous Substances to any place or location in violation of, or as could be

 



      
 

 



 

expected to result in any Liability to any Acquired Company under, any
Environmental Laws.

 



 

(viii) None of the Acquired Companies has been requested or required by any
Governmental Entity to perform any investigatory or remedial activity or other
action in connection with any actual or alleged release of Hazardous
Substances or any other Environmental Matter.

 



 

(ix) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not require the

Environmental Laws.

 



 

(m) _Real Property_.

 



 

(i) Section 6.1(m)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete
and correct list of all material Company Owned Real Property (including the
street address of each parcel of such Company Owned Real Property). The
Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable fee simple
title to all such material Company Owned Real Property free and clear of any
and all Liens. The Company is not obligated under, or a party to, any option,

portion thereof or interest therein.

 



 

(ii) Section 6.1(m)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete
and correct list of all material Company Leased Real Property, including with
respect to all such Company Leased Real Property the date of such lease or
sublease and any material amendments thereto and the street address of such
Company Leased Real Property. Except as would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company or the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, each of
the Acquired Companies, as applicable, has good leasehold title to the Company
Leased Real Property, free and clear of any Liens. All leases and subleases
for the Company Leased Real Property are valid and in full force and effect in
all material respects except to the extent they have previously expired or
terminated in accordance with their terms and neither an Acquired Company nor,
to the Knowledge of the Company, any other Person, has violated any provision
of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default that would be materially
adverse, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Acquired Companies,
taken as a whole, under the provisions of, any lease or sublease for the
Company Leased Real Property. Other than as set forth on Section 6.1(m)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into with any other Person any sublease, license or
other Contract that is material, either individually or in the aggregate, to
the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, and that relates to the use or
occupancy of all or any portion of the Company Leased Real Property.

 



 

(iii) The Company Owned Real Property and Company Leased Real Property
constitute all real property currently used in connection with the business

 



      
 

 



 

of the Acquired Companies and which are necessary for the continued operation
of the business as the business is currently conducted. Except as set forth on
Section 6.1(m)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as would not
materially affect, either individually or in the aggregate, the ability of the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, to operate their business as currently
conducted, there are no structural, electrical, mechanical or other defects in
any improvements located on any of the Company Owned Real Property or Company
Leased Real Property. Except as would not materially affect, either
individually or in the aggregate, the ability of the Acquired Companies, taken

Acquired Companies has received written notice of any pending, and to the
Knowledge of the Company there is no threatened, condemnation proceeding with
respect to any of the Company Owned Real Property or the Company Leased Real
Property.

 



 

(iv) Except as would not materially affect, either individually or in the
aggregate, the ability of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, to operate
their business as currently conducted, each of the structures, equipment and
other tangible assets of the Acquired Companies utilized in their operations
is in good and usable condition, subject to normal wear and tear and normal
industry practice with respect to maintenance, and is adequate and suitable
for the purposes for which it is presently being used.

 



 

(n) _Taxes_. Except as set forth on Section 6.1(n) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each Acquired Company (A) has prepared in good faith and duly and
timely filed (taking into account any extension of time within which to file)
all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them and all such filed Tax
Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects; (B) has paid all
Taxes that are required to be paid or that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee,
creditor or third party; and (C) has not waived any statute of limitations

assessment or deficiency. As of the date hereof, except as set forth on
Section 6.1(n) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are not pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, or threatened in writing, any audits,
examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax
matters. No Acquired Company has been subject to a written claim by a taxing
authority in a jurisdiction where such Acquired Company does not file Tax
Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There
are no material unresolved questions or claims concerning any Acquired
Companys Tax Liability that are not disclosed or provided for in the Company
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent true and correct copies of the United States federal
income Tax Returns filed by the Acquired Companies for each of the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2014 through 2016, and true and correct summaries of
certain information relating to foreign operations derived from United States
federal income Tax returns for each of the fiscal years ended December 31,
2014 through 2016. The Acquired Companies have made provision for all Taxes
payable by the Acquired Companies for which no Company Tax Return has yet been
filed. The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to the
Acquired Companies

 



      
 

 



 

reflected on the Company Reports are adequate under GAAP to cover the Tax
liabilities accruing through the date thereof. None of the Acquired Companies
are responsible for Taxes of any Person (i) as a result of transferee or
successor liability, of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group (including as a result of the application of
Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6) for any period, through operation of Law or
otherwise, or (ii) as a result of any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or Tax
allocation agreement or any other express or implied agreement to indemnify
any other Person. No Acquired Company has ever participated in any listed
transaction within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b. No
Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude

of state, local or foreign Law), (v) any prepaid amount received or deferred
revenue accrued on or prior to the Closing Date, (vi) election under Section
108(i) of the Code, or (vii) Section 965 of the Code (including an election
under Section 965(h) of the Code). No Acquired Company (w) has agreed to and
is not required to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code
or any similar provision of law, (x) is aware that any Governmental Entity has
proposed any such adjustment, (y) has any application pending with any
Governmental Entity requesting permission for any changes in accounting
method, or (z) will be required to include any material item of income in, or
exclude any material deduction in calculating, taxable income for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any
change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. None of the Acquired Companies is subject to any private letter
ruling of the IRS or comparable ruling of any other Governmental Authority, in
each case, that would have binding effect on Parent or the Acquired Companies
after the Closing. There are no Liens for Taxes on the assets of any Acquired
Company (other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable as of the Closing
Date or Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been recorded in
accordance with GAAP). All transactions between the Acquired Companies are on
arms length terms for purposes of the relevant transfer pricing laws and all
related documentation required by such laws has been prepared or obtained and,
if necessary, retained. No Acquired Company has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying or
intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code in
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company is not, and has
not been, during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)
of the Code, a "United States real property holding corporation" within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Schedule 6.1(n) sets forth the U.S.
federal income tax classification of each Acquired Company and indicates
whether each such entity is a

 



       
 

 



 

"controlled foreign corporation" within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code
or "passive foreign investment company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of
the Code. No Acquired Company has any material Liability with respect to
income, franchise or similar Taxes that accrued on or before December 31,
2017, in excess of the amounts accrued with respect thereto that are reflected
in the financial statements included in the Company Reports filed on or prior
to the date hereof. For purposes of this _Section 6.1(n)_, any reference to
an Acquired Company shall be deemed to include any Person that merged with or
was liquidated or converted into an Acquired Company.

 



 

(o) _Labor Matters_.

 



 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 6.1(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Acquired Company is a party to or otherwise bound by any collective

any material proceeding asserting that any Acquired Company has committed an
unfair labor practice or is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor
union or labor organization nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, nor has there been for the past five years, any labor
strike, dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving any
Acquired Company.

from employment or refusal to hire, (v) claims relating to an alleged failure

(vi) investigations, citations or complaints by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, or (vii) claims or conciliation agreements relating to
any alleged failure to comply with Executive Order 11246 or Federal Contract
Compliance with respect to employees, which, in the case of any of the above
clauses, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To its Knowledge, the Company and each of the
Acquired Companies (A) is in compliance with all federal and state laws
respecting employment or labor and employment practices, terms and conditions
of employment, wages, hours, WARN and any similar state or local "mass layoff"

immaterial non-compliance; (B) has not engaged in any

Acquired Company.

 



 

(p) _Insurance_. Section 6.1(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete and accurate list of all material insurance policies, fidelity
bonds and self-insurance arrangements covering the assets, businesses,
equipment, properties, operations, employees, officers or directors of the
Acquired Companies (collectively, the " **Insurance Policies** "). All of the
Insurance Policies or renewals thereof are in full force and effect and not
voidable. There is no material claim by any Acquired Company pending under any
such Insurance Policy as to which any Acquired Company has been notified that
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such
Insurance Policy. All premiums due and payable under all Insurance Policies
have been paid when due, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are
otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such Insurance Policies. No
Acquired Company has received notice of cancellation of, or cancelled, any
Insurance Policy. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no threatened
termination of, or material premium increase (other than with respect to
customary annual premium increases) with respect to, any Insurance Policy. The
Company has made available to Parent copies of all Insurance Policies.

 



 

(q) _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(i) The Acquired Companies exclusively own or possess adequate licenses or
other valid rights to use all Intellectual Property used or held for use in
connection with and material to their respective businesses as currently being
conducted (" **Company Intellectual Property** ").

 



 

(ii) There are no assertions, claims or Legal Proceedings challenging the
validity or enforceability of any Company Intellectual Property. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the Acquired Companies respective
businesses as currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate any Intellectual Property rights of any Person. No Acquired
Company is the subject of any pending or threatened Legal Proceedings
involving a claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the
Intellectual Property rights of any Person. To the Knowledge of the Company,
no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated or is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Company Intellectual
Property, and no such claims have been made against any Person by an Acquired
Company.

 



 

(iii) The Acquired Companies have taken adequate security measures to protect
the secrecy, confidentiality and value of all trade secrets included in the
Company Intellectual Property. No such trade secret has been authorized to be
disclosed or has been disclosed by an Acquired Company to any former or
current employee or any other Person other than pursuant to a written non-
disclosure agreement restricting the disclosure and use of such trade secret
and other Intellectual Property. The

 



      
 

 



 

Acquired Companies have executed written agreements with all of their past and
present employees, contractors and consultants that created or developed
Company Intellectual Property in the course of such Persons employment or
retention pursuant to which such Persons have presently assigned to an
Acquired Company all of such Persons rights, title and interest in and to all
such Company Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, no party
thereto is in default or breach of any such agreements.

 



 

(iv) The Acquired Companies own or have a valid right to use all computer
systems, networks, hardware, software, databases, websites and equipment used
to process, store, maintain and operate data, information and functions used
in connection with their respective businesses (" **IT Systems** "). The IT
Systems (A) are adequate for and operate and perform in all material respects
as required in connection with the operation of the Acquired Companies
respective businesses as currently being conducted, and (B) have not suffered
any material breach or failure in the past two years. No open source software
or freeware has been incorporated into any product of the Acquired Companies
that would in any way limit the ability to make, use or sell such product or
that would diminish or transfer the rights of ownership in any Intellectual
Property of an Acquired Company to a third party.

 



 

(v) Section 6.1(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an complete
and accurate list of all registered Intellectual Property and pending
applications for registration of Intellectual Property owned or purported to
be owned by any Acquired Company. Section 6.1(q) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule provides for each such item listed, the owner of such item of
Intellectual Property, the registration or application date and number (as and
if applicable) of such item of Intellectual Property and the jurisdiction in
which such item of Intellectual Property has been issued or registered or in
which any application for issuance and registration has been filed (if
applicable). All material Intellectual Property set forth on Section 6.1(q) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule is subsisting, enforceable, and valid.

 



 

(r) _Brokers and Finders_.

 



 

(i) Except for the Advisors set forth on Section 6.1(r)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no Advisor of or to the Acquired Companies
engaged in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (each such Advisor, a
" **Company Advisor** "). Other than Greenhill and Co., LLC, there is no Company
Advisor or officer or director of the Acquired Companies who might be entitled
to any banking, brokers, finders, success, completion or similar fee or
commission in connection with: (A) this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions; or (B) any other change in control of the Acquired Companies, or
the sale, transfer or disposition of any assets of the Acquired Companies.

Section 6.1(r)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as expressly
provided by the terms of a written agreement between the Acquired Companies
and a Company Advisor that is listed in Section 6.1(r)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and has been made available to Parent, no Company Advisor
will be entitled to any fee, expense or other amount from any Acquired Company
in connection with this Agreement or any Contemplated Transaction that
includes any premium or is based in whole or in part on any fee, expense or

Company nor any Representative of any Acquired Company shall have breached or
taken any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in this
_Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.4_ or failed to enforce any "standstill" or
similar agreement or provision under which any Acquired Company has any rights
or any Support Agreement; (ii) the Company Board reasonably determines in good
faith, after taking into account the advice of an independent financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and consulting with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after taking into account the advice of
the Companys outside legal counsel, that such action is required for the
Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Delaware
Law; and (iv) at least two business days prior to furnishing any such non-
public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Company: (A) gives Parent written notice of the identity of such
Person and of the Companys intention to furnish non-public information to, or
enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person; and (B) receives
from the Person so requesting such information, and delivers to Parent a copy
of, an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on
the use and disclosure of all non-public written and oral information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies and
customary "standstill" provisions and other terms no less favorable to the
Company than the provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement as in
effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, and at least 24
hours prior to furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the
Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such
non-public information has not been previously furnished by the Company to
Parent).

 



 

(c) If the Company, any other Acquired Company or any Representative of any
Acquired Company receives an Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal or
any non-public information is requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of the Acquired
Companies Representatives, then the Company shall promptly (and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt of such Acquisition Inquiry, Acquisition
Proposal or request): (i) advise Parent orally and in writing of such
Acquisition Inquiry, Acquisition Proposal or request (including the identity
of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Inquiry,

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal or request and the material terms and conditions
thereof); and (ii) provide to Parent a copy of any written inquiries,
documents or correspondence received by any Acquired Company or any
Representative of any Acquired Company. The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed on the status of any such Acquisition Inquiry, Acquisition Proposal
or request and any modification or proposed modification thereto, and shall
promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after transmittal or receipt of
any correspondence or communication) provide Parent with a copy of any
correspondence or communication between or otherwise involving any Acquired
Company or any Representative of any Acquired Company and the Person that made
or submitted such Acquisition Inquiry, Acquisition Proposal or request.

 



 

(d) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company or any of the other Acquired Companies to return all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of the other Acquired Companies, and terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any Person (other than
Parent and its Representatives).

 



 

(e) Any action inconsistent with any provision in this _Section 7.2_ or
_Section 7.4_ that is taken by any Representative of the Acquired Company,
whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the
Acquired Companies, shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement by
the Company.

 



 

7.3 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall promptly after the date of this
Agreement (but in any event no later than 10 business days following the date
of this Agreement) prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement in
preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement,
including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " **Proxy Statement** ").
The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments from
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company
and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the
Proxy Statement from the SEC. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and shall ensure that the Proxy
Statement includes: (i) the opinion of the financial advisor referred to in
_Section 6.1(c)(ii)_; (ii) a fair summary of the financial analysis conducted
by such financial advisor in accordance with applicable Law; and (iii)
disclosure of the compensation, if any, paid to such financial advisor by
Parent, the Company and any of their respective Affiliates, during the three
year period prior to the date of this Agreement. Parent and the Company each
agree that none of the information

 



      
 

 



 

supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of
mailing to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company shall consult with Parent and provide Parent and
its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto (and to review and comment
on any comments of the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto) and any other documents related to the
Stockholders Meeting prior to filing such documents with the SEC or other
applicable Governmental Authority and mailing such documents to the Companys
stockholders. The Company shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent or its legal counsel on the Proxy Statement (or any
amendments or supplements thereto) and such other documents related to the
Stockholders Meeting. If any event relating to any of the Acquired Companies
occurs, or if the Company becomes aware of any information, that should be
disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, then the
Company shall promptly inform Parent thereof and shall promptly file such
amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, mail such amendment
or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company, commencing upon
the submission to the SEC of the Proxy Statement in accordance with the first
sentence of this _Section 7.3_, shall on a weekly basis run a broker search
for a deemed record date of 20 business days after the date of such search.

 



 

7.4 _Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within five business days following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date), (i)
in compliance with applicable Law and its certificate and bylaws, and by
resolutions of the Company Board, establish the earliest reasonably
practicable record date (the " **Record Date** ") for a meeting of holders of
Shares (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "
**Stockholders Meeting** "), (ii) by resolutions of the Company Board,
establish the earliest reasonably practicable date for the Stockholders
Meeting to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Stockholders Meeting shall be no later than 45 days
following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date without the prior written consent
of Parent, and (iii) mail to the stockholders of the Company as of the Record
Date the Proxy Statement. The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement Clearance Date. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited
in connection with the Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with
all applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 7.4(d)_: (i) the Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Company Board has unanimously determined and
believes that the Merger is advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders; (ii) has unanimously approved this Agreement
and unanimously approved

 



      
 

 



 

the Contemplated Transactions, including the Merger, in accordance with the
requirements of the DGCL; and (iii) unanimously recommends that the
stockholders of the Company vote to adopt this Agreement at the Stockholders
Meeting (the unanimous determination by the Company Board referred in the
foregoing is collectively referred to as the " **Company Board
Recommendation** ").

 



 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i) except as
provided in _Section 7.4(d)_, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, or permit the withdrawal or modification in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub of, the Company Board Recommendation (it being
understood and agreed that the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed to
have been modified by the Company Board in a manner adverse to Parent and
Merger Sub if the Company Board Recommendation shall no longer be unanimous)
(a " **Company Adverse Recommendation Change** "); (ii) recommend the
approval, acceptance or adoption of, or approve, endorse, accept or adopt, any
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve or recommend, or cause or permit any
Acquired Company to execute or enter into, any Company Acquisition Agreement
constituting or relating directly or indirectly to, or that contemplates or is
intended or could reasonably be expected to result directly or indirectly in,
an Acquisition Transaction, other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in clause "(iv)" of _Section 7.2(b)_; or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly
propose to, or permit any Acquired Company or any Representative of any
Acquired Company to agree or publicly propose to, take any of the actions
referred to in this _Section 7.4(c)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clause "(i)" of
_Section 7.4(c)_, at any time prior to, but not after, the adoption of this
Agreement by the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if:

 



 

(i) (A) an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal is made to the
Company and is not withdrawn; (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not result
directly or indirectly from a breach of or any action inconsistent with any of
the provisions of _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.4_ or any "standstill" or
similar agreement or provision under which any Acquired Company has any
rights; (C) the Company provides Parent, at least 72 hours prior to any
meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board will consider and
determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, with a
written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for
holding such meeting, the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal
that is the basis of the potential action by the Company Board (including a
copy of any draft Contract relating to such Acquisition Proposal) and the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal; (D) the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after having taken into account the
advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (E) the Company Board reasonably
determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of the
Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board is required to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Delaware Law; (F) no less than four business days prior to making a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board delivers to Parent a
written notice (a " **Recommendation Change Notice** "): (1) stating that the
Company has received a Superior Proposal that did not result directly or
indirectly from a breach of or any action inconsistent with any of the
provisions of _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.4_ or any "standstill" or similar
agreement or provision under which any Acquired Company has any rights or any
Support Agreement; (2) stating that the Company Board intends to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such Superior Proposal
and describing any intended modification of the Company Board Recommendation;
(3) specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal; and (4)
attaching copies of the most current and complete draft of any Contract
relating to such Superior Proposal and all other documents and communications
relating to such Superior Proposal; (G) throughout the period between the
delivery of such Recommendation Change Notice and any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company (through the Company Board) engages (to the
extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be legally required as a result of such Superior Proposal; and (H) at
the time of making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the failure to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would constitute a breach
of the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under applicable Delaware
Law in light of such Superior Proposal (after taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the
negotiations required by clause "(G)" above or otherwise); or

 



 

(ii) (A) there shall arise, after the date of this Agreement, an Intervening
Event that leads the Company Board to consider making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; (B) the Company provides Parent, at least 72 hours
prior to any meeting of the Company Board that the Company Board will consider
and determine whether such Intervening Event requires the Company Board to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, with a written notice specifying
the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting and a
reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event; (C) the Company
Board reasonably determines in good faith, after having taken into account the
advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is required in
order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Delaware Law; (D) no less than four business days prior to making
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board delivers to
Parent a written notice: (1) stating that an Intervening Event has arisen; (2)
stating that it intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
light of such Intervening Event and describing any intended modification of
the Company Board Recommendation; and (3) containing a reasonably detailed
description of such Intervening Event; (E) throughout the period between the
delivery of such notice and any withdrawal or

 



      
 

 



 

modification of the Company Board Recommendation, the Company (through the
Company Board) engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that no
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be legally required as a result of
such Intervening Event; and (F) at the time of making such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the failure to do so would constitute a breach of the
fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under applicable Delaware Law in
light of such Intervening Event (after taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations
required by clause "(E)" above or otherwise).

 



 

For purposes of clause "(i)" of the first sentence of this _Section 7.4(d)_,
any change in the form or amount of the consideration payable in connection
with a Superior Proposal, and any other material change to any of the terms of
a Superior Proposal, will be deemed to be a new Superior Proposal, requiring a
new Recommendation Change Notice and a new advance notice period. The Company
agrees to keep confidential, and not to disclose to the public or to any
Person, any and all information regarding any negotiations that take place
pursuant to clause "(i)(G)" or clause "(ii)(E)" of the first sentence of this
_Section 7.4(d)_ (including the existence and terms of any proposal made on
behalf of Parent or the Company during such negotiations). The Company shall
ensure that any Company Adverse Recommendation Change: (x) does not change or
otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement or the Support Agreements by
the Company Board or any other approval of the Company Board; and (y) does not
have the effect of causing any corporate takeover statute or other similar
statute (including any "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business
combination" or "fair price" statute) of the State of Delaware or any other
state to be applicable to this Agreement, any of the Support Agreements, the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

(e) The Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with _Section 7.4(a)_ shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
of any Superior Proposal or other Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal,
by any Intervening Event or by any Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that: (i)
the Company shall not submit any Acquisition Proposal to a vote of the
stockholders of the Company; and (ii) the Company shall not (without Parents
prior written consent) adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose to adjourn,
postpone or cancel) the Stockholders Meeting, but shall adjourn, postpone or
cancel the Stockholders Meeting at the prior written direction of Parent.

 



 

7.5 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement
and applicable Laws to

 



       
 

 



 

consummate and make effective the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party or any Governmental Entity in
order to consummate the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions;
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent or Merger Sub (i) to proffer to, or agree to,
sell or hold separate and agree to sell, before or after the Effective Time,
any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or
agreement to sell, by any Acquired Company of any of its assets or
businesses), (ii) to agree to any material changes or restriction in the
operations of any such assets or businesses, or (iii) to contest any Legal
Proceeding relating to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of
information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions (including
the Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Company
and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(b) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the
other with all information reasonably requested concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent each shall keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
Contemplated Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies
of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party or any
Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.

 



 

7.6 _Access_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause
the other Acquired Companies and their respective Representatives to afford
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books,
Contracts and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause the other Acquired Companies and their respective Representatives to)
furnish promptly to Parent and its Representatives all information concerning
the Acquired Companies business, properties

 



      
 

 



 

and personnel as may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation
pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company, and provided, further, that
the foregoing shall not require such party (a) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of Company, would
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
of the Acquired Companies obligations with respect to confidentiality if the
Company shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third
party to such inspection or disclosure or to seek reasonable alternative means
for the sharing of such information or (b) to disclose any privileged
information of such party or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for
information made pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall be directed to an
executive officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by such
executive officer, as the case may be. All such information shall be governed
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause the Representatives of each of the Acquired
Companies to, permit Parents officers and other Representatives to meet, upon
reasonable notice and during normal business hours, with the chief financial
officer and other officers of the Company to discuss such matters as Parent
may deem necessary or appropriate. Without limiting the generality of any of
the foregoing, but subject to applicable United States and foreign antitrust
and competition Laws, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of:

 



 

(a) all material operating and financial reports prepared by the Acquired
Companies for the Companys senior management, including: (i) copies of the
unaudited monthly consolidated balance sheets of the Acquired Companies and
the related unaudited monthly consolidated statements of operations,
statements of stockholders equity and statements of cash flows; and (ii)
copies of any marketing plans, development plans, write-off reports, hiring
reports and capital expenditure reports prepared for the Companys senior
management;

 



 

(b) any written materials or communications sent by or on behalf of the
Company to its stockholders;

 



 

(c) any material notice, document or other communication (other than any
communication that relates solely to routine commercial transactions and that
is of the type sent in the ordinary course of business) sent by or on behalf
of any of the Acquired Companies to any party to any Company Contract that
constitutes a Material Contract or sent to any of the Acquired Companies by
any party to any Company Contract that constitutes a Material Contract;

 



 

(d) any notice, report or other document filed with or sent to any
Governmental Entity on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies in connection
with the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions; and

 



 

(e) any material notice, report or other document received by any of the
Acquired Companies from any Governmental Entity.

 



      
 

 



 

7.7 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Surviving Corporation shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Shares to be delisted from the NYSE and
deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time.

 



 

7.8 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries or any Representative of any of the Acquired
Companies to, make any disclosure to any Company Associates (including with
respect to compensation and benefit matters), to the public or otherwise
regarding the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions unless: (a)
Parent shall have approved such disclosure; or (b) the Company shall have been
advised in writing by its outside legal counsel that such disclosure is
required by applicable Law and shall have provided Parent with reasonable
advance notice of the Companys intention to make such disclosure and the
content of such disclosure.

 



 

7.9 _Employee Benefits - General._

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date
which is 12 months from the Effective Time (or if earlier, the date of the
employees termination of employment with any Acquired Company), Parent shall
provide (or shall cause the Company or its Affiliates to provide, as
applicable), each employee who is employed by an Acquired Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time who remains employed immediately after the
Effective Time (" **Company Continuing Employee** ") with: (i) base salary or
hourly wages which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided
by the applicable Acquired Company immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), if any,
which are no less than the target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation) provided by the applicable Acquired Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time; (iii) retirement and welfare benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the applicable Acquired
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iv) severance benefits
that are no less favorable than the practice, plan or policy in effect for
such Company Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, " **Parent Benefit Plans** ") in which any Company
Continuing Employees will participate effective as of or after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or the applicable Subsidiary
to, recognize all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary as if such service were with Parent, for vesting
and eligibility purposes in any Parent Benefit Plan in which such Company
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time;
provided, however, such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x)
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such service
was not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
express or implied, shall (i) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular compensation or benefit
plan, (B) employ or retain the employment of any particular employee, (ii) be
construed to create any third party rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever in any employee (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the
Company or any other Person that is not a party to this Agreement or (iii)
constitute an amendment of any Parent Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) _Access to Employees._ From the date following the date hereof that is
mutually agreed upon between the parties (which shall not be later than 30
days following the date hereof), the Company shall cooperate with Parent in
permitting Parent reasonable access to employees (i) to interview during
normal business hours, (ii) to seek consent from any employees to perform
background checks and drug testing, consistent with Parents policies, and
(iii) to communicate to employees any information concerning employment with
Parent or its Subsidiaries in accordance with this Agreement. Not later than
five business days after the date hereof, the Company shall make available to
Parent a list of all employees, including, for each employee, the employees
name, title, salary, work location, status (active, on leave, etc.), date of
birth, "exempt" or "non-exempt" status, and full or part time status.

 



 

7.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, it will cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company (when acting in such capacity), determined
as of the Effective Time (the " **Indemnified Parties** "), against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted to do so under Delaware Law and its certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or pursuant to other agreements in effect on the date hereof to
indemnify such Person (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
"(a)" of this _Section 7.10_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for

 



      
 

 



 

any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys existing officers
and directors liability insurance (" **D andO Insurance**") for a period of six
years after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor (on an
annualized basis) is not in excess of 3.0 times the last annual premium paid
prior to the date hereof and set forth on _Section 7.10(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " **Current Premium** "); provided, however, that if
the existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled during such
six-year period, the Surviving Corporation will use reasonable efforts to
obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such
period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized basis) of 2.0 times the
Current Premium. In lieu of maintaining such DandO Insurance, prior to the
Effective Time, the Acquired Companies may, at their option and expenses
(following reasonable consultation with Parent), purchase prepaid "tail"
insurance for the Acquired Companies and their current and former officers,
directors and employees who are covered by the policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance currently
maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Companies as of the date of
this Agreement for a period of six years from the Effective Time, such tail
insurance to provide coverage in an amount substantially equivalent to the
existing coverage.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives.

 



 

7.11 _Takeover Statute._ If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions, each of Parent and the
Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or by the Merger and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.

 



 

7.12 _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall obtain and deliver to
Parent at or prior to the Effective Time (or, at the option of Parent, at a
later date) the resignation of each director of each of the Acquired

**Termination Date** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that a party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.2(a)_ if

all materiality and similar qualifications limiting the scope of such
representations or warranties shall be disregarded; and (b) any update of or
modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on
or after the date of this Agreement shall be disregarded) and such breach or

satisfied (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy
of such representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as
of any subsequent date: (i) all materiality and similar qualifications
limiting the scope of such representations or warranties shall be disregarded;
and (ii) any update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or

_Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_ and (ii) at or prior to the time of the
termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made; and (iii) within 18 months
after the date of any such termination, an Acquisition Transaction (whether or
not relating to such Acquisition Proposal) is consummated or a definitive
agreement contemplating an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not relating to
such Acquisition Proposal) is executed, then the Company shall pay to Parent a
non-refundable fee in the amount of $4,300,000 in cash (the " **Termination
Fee** ").

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by: (i) Parent pursuant to _Section
9.4(a)_ or (ii) Parent or Company pursuant to any other provision of _Section
9.1_, _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_ or _Section 9.4_, as applicable, at any

be paid and made by the Company contemporaneously with the consummation of, or
entry into of a definitive agreement relating to, the Acquisition Transaction

payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same time or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events.

 



 

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.6_ are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions, and that, without
these covenants, obligations and agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay
the amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.6_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the fee set forth in this _Section 9.6_ or any
portion of such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the prime rate

 



      
 

 



 

as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ (or if not reported therein, as
reported in another authoritative source reasonably selected by Parent) in
effect on the date such Termination Fee was required to be paid from such date
until (but excluding) the date of full payment thereof.

 



 

(f) Any fee or other amount payable pursuant to this _Section 9.6_ shall be
paid by the Company free and clear of all deductions and withholdings. In the
event that any deduction or withholding is required by applicable Law, the
Company shall pay to Parent such additional amount as shall be required to
ensure that the net amount received by Parent shall be equal to the full
amount that would have been received by Parent had no such deduction or
withholding been required to be made, and the Company shall indemnify Parent
against, and reimburse Parent for the full amount of, any such withholding or
deduction, and any interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon.

 



 

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)_ or _Section 9.4(d)_, the Company shall as promptly as practicable
(but in any event within three business days) following receipt of an invoice
therefor pay all of the documented reasonable reasonable out-of-pocket fees
and expenses (including legal and other third party advisors fees and
expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, but in no event more than $1,750,000 (the " **Expense
Payment** ") as directed by Parent in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the amount of any Expense Payment pursuant to this _Section 9.6(g)_ shall be
credited against any obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 9.6_.

are signatories hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The parties hereto
further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section
7.10_ shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

 



 

10.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company._ Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

 



      
 

 



 

Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

10.10 _Severability._ The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

10.11 _Construction._ The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and
drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

10.12 _Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; provided, however, that Parent may designate, by written notice
to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a
party to this Agreement in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of
such designation. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is
void.

 



 

10.13 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.6_, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.

 



 

10.14 _Remedies_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement required to
be performed by the Company were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by the Company of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to obtain,
without proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy to which
Parent may be entitled at lLaw or in equity): (a) a decree or order of

 



      
 

 



 

specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation; and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. The Company hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing: (i) Parent shall be entitled to specific
performance of each covenant and obligation of the Company contained in this
Agreement, including the Companys obligation to consummate the Merger and the
Companys covenants in _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.4_; and (ii) if the
Company Requisite Vote is not obtained as a result of a breach of any covenant
or obligation of the Company contained in this Agreement or as a result of a
breach of any Support Agreement, then Parent may, at its election, require
that the Company resubmit this Agreement and the Merger to its stockholders
for a further vote.

 



 

10.15 _Cooperation_. The Company agrees to cooperate fully with Parent and to
execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and
instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by
Parent to evidence or reflect the Contemplated Transactions and to carry out
the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

10.16 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections
contained in _Article VI_ (or other applicable provision of this Agreement),
and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered part shall be deemed
to relate to and to qualify only the particular representation or warranty set
forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered section in _Article VI_ (or
other applicable provision of this Agreement), and shall not be deemed to
relate to or to qualify any other representation or warranty, except where it
is readily apparent on its face from the substance of the matter disclosed
that such information is intended to qualify another representation or
warranty.

 



 

10.17 _Attorneys  Fees_. In any action at Law or suit in equity to enforce
this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing
party in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive its reasonable
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such
action or suit.
