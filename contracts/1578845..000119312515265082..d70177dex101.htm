_Transfer_ ") any Shares is subject to the restrictions set forth in this
_Article 2_ , and no Transfer of Shares by the Shareholder or any of its
Affiliates may be effected except in compliance with this _Article 2_.

and null and void, regardless of whether the purported transferee has any
actual or constructive knowledge of the Transfer restrictions set forth in
this Agreement, and shall not be recorded on the stock transfer books of the
Company or the Depositary or any local custodian or transfer agent.

(a) The Shareholder shall not directly or indirectly, in any single
transaction or series of related transactions, Transfer any Shares during the
12-month period commencing on the date hereof (the " _Lock-Up Period_ ")
without the prior written consent of the Company, other than:

(i) a Transfer of Shares in response to a tender or exchange offer by any

recommendation are Incumbent Directors) or a Transfer of Shares permitted by
_Section 2.1(e)_;

 

(ii) a Transfer of Shares to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company;

 

(iii) a Transfer of Shares to a Permitted Transferee, so long as such
Permitted Transferee, to the extent it has not already done so, executes a
customary joinder to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, in which such Permitted Transferee agrees to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement as if such Permitted Transferee was an
original party hereto;

(iv) a Transfer of Shares pursuant to Section 5.5 and meeting the requirements
of Section 2.1(c)(ii); and

of Shareholder (such that the Shareholder is a direct or indirect Subsidiary
of another Person or all or substantially all of the Shareholders assets have
been acquired by another Person) shall be subject to Section 6.6(d);

faith, based on generally available public information and the advice of its
financial advisors, to determine whether such Person is an Activist

issuer on Schedule 13G shall be deemed to establish conclusively that such
Person is not an Activist Investor with respect to such issuer for purposes of

particular counterparty or counterparties and the Shareholder reasonably
believes, after due inquiry, as of the date of such Transfer, that the
Transfer executed by such broker-dealer is not or will not be to a Prohibited
Transferee);

 

(iv) a Transfer of Shares to a counterparty (other than a Prohibited
Transferee) in connection with a Hedging Arrangement, including any related

as of the date of such Transfer, that the Transfer by such counterparty is not
or will not be to a Prohibited Transferee); or

 

(v) a Transfer of Shares permitted by _Section 2.1(e)_.

-11-  Company, (B) any merger, consolidation or business combination of the
Company or (C) the sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company,
except in each of clause (A), (B) and (C) where such proposal has not been
approved or recommended by the Board of Directors, in which event the
preceding sentence shall apply.

 

(b) So long as the aggregate number of Ordinary Share Equivalents Beneficially
Owned by the Shareholder and its Group Members, as a group, is greater than
or equal to 5% of the then issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares, with
respect to any matter that the Shareholder is required to vote on in
accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_, the Shareholder shall cause each Voting
Security owned by it or over which it has voting control to be voted by
completing the proxy forms distributed by the Company or the voting
instructions distributed by the Depositary, as applicable, and not by any
other means. The Shareholder shall deliver the completed proxy form to the

-14- ARTICLE 5

 

 _Registration Rights._

 

Section 5.1. _Demand Registration_. At any time and from time to time
beginning on the date that is nine months after the date of this Agreement,
the Shareholder may request in writing (" _Request_ ") that the Company
register under the Securities Act all or part of the Registrable Securities
that are Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder or its Affiliates (a) on a
Registration Statement on Form F-3 or other available form (a " _Demand
Registration_ ") or (b) on a Shelf Registration Statement covering any
Registrable Securities (or otherwise designating an existing Shelf
Registration Statement with the SEC to cover the Registrable Securities) (a "
_Shelf Registration_ "), in each case, covering the sale or distribution of
the Registrable Securities from time to time by the Shareholder, on a delayed
or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including by
way of underwritten offering, block sale or other distribution plan designated
by the Shareholder. Upon receipt of any Request (it being understood that
unless otherwise notified by the Shareholder, the Shareholder shall be deemed
to have made such Request as of the date that is nine months after the date of
this Agreement), the Company shall as promptly as practicable but in any
event not later than the date that is thirty (30) calendar days after receipt
by the Company of such Request, in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, file a Registration Statement with the SEC covering all such
Registrable Securities, in accordance with the method or methods of
distribution thereof elected by the Shareholder, _provided_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall require the Company to (i) cause such registration to
become effective prior to the date that is one year after the date of this
Agreement or (ii) file a Registration Statement prior to the date that is one
year after the date of this Agreement if the Registration Statement to be
filed is an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement. In the event that any
such Request involves a Hedging Arrangement in which the counterparty to the
Shareholder uses the Shelf Registration Statement to effect short sales of
Registrable Securities, the consent of the Company shall be required in
connection with such Request, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. The Shareholder shall be entitled to make no more than
two (2) Requests in any twelve-month period and four (4) Requests in
the aggregate (it being understood that (x) each underwritten offering under
this Agreement shall count as a Request, even if such offering is conducted
pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, unless the Shareholder withdraws
its request in the circumstances described in the second sentence of Section
5.6, and (y) the deemed Request contemplated by the parenthetical set forth in
the second sentence of this _Section 5.1_ shall not count as a Request for
purposes of this sentence), and each such Request shall be to register an
amount of Registrable Securities having an aggregate value of at least
$200,000,000. The Company shall not be obligated to effect a Demand
Registration during the sixty (60) calendar day period following the
effective date of a Registration Statement pursuant to any other Demand
Registration. Each Request pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ shall be in writing
and shall specify the number of Registrable Securities requested to be
registered and the intended method of distribution of such Registrable
Securities. No request for registration shall count for the purposes of the
limitations in this _Section 5.1_ if (v) the Shareholder determines in good
faith to withdraw (prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement
relating to such request) the proposed registration, upon written notice to

 



-15-  the Company, due to marketing conditions or regulatory reasons prior to the
execution of an underwriting agreement or purchase agreement relating to such
request; provided that the Shareholder reimburses the Company for all
Registration Expenses incurred in good faith by the Company in connection with
such Demand Registration prior to the date of such withdrawal, (w) the
Registration Statement relating to a Demand Request is not declared effective
within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the date such Registration
Statement is filed with the SEC (other than by reason of the Shareholder
having refused to proceed or a misrepresentation or an omission by
the Shareholder), (x) prior to the sale of at least fifty percent (50%) of
the Registrable Securities included in the applicable registration relating to
a Demand Request, such registration is adversely affected by any stop order,
injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental
agency or court for any reason and the Company fails to have such stop order,
injunction, or other order or requirement removed, withdrawn or resolved to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Shareholder within thirty (30) calendar
days after the date of such order, (y) the Shareholder withdraws its request
in the circumstances described in the second sentence of Section 5.6 _,_ or
(z) the conditions to closing specified in any underwriting agreement or
purchase agreement entered into in connection with the registration relating
to such request are not satisfied as a result of a default or breach
thereunder by the Company that proximately and primarily caused the failure
of such conditions. Nothing in this _Article 5_ shall affect, supersede or
otherwise modify any of the restrictions on Transfer set forth in _Article 2_
or any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.2. _Restrictions on Demand Registrations_. The Company may (a)
postpone the filing or the effectiveness of a Registration Statement
requested by the Shareholder or of a supplement or amendment thereto during
the regular quarterly period during which directors and executive officers of
the Company are not permitted to trade under the insider trading policy of
the Company then in effect until the expiration of such quarterly period (but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of the Companys
quarterly earnings announcement) and (b) postpone for up to ninety (90)
calendar days the filing or the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or
of a supplement or amendment thereto if the Board of Directors determines in
good faith that such Demand Registration or Shelf Registration, as the case
may be, would (i) reasonably be expected to materially impede, delay,
interfere with or otherwise have a material adverse effect on any material
acquisition of assets (other than in the ordinary course of business), merger,
consolidation, tender offer, financing or any other material business
transaction by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) require
disclosure of information that has not been, and is otherwise not required to
be, disclosed to the public, the premature disclosure of which would
materially and adversely affect the Company (any such period in either clause
(a) or (b) to be referred to as a " _Blackout Period_ "). The postponement
rights in clause (b) of the first sentence of this  _Section 5.2_ shall not
be applicable to the Shareholder for more than a total of ninety (90) calendar
days during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months. The postponement
rights in clause (b) of the first sentence of this _Section 5.2_ and the
holdback obligation in _Section 5.10_ shall not be applicable to the
Shareholder for more than a total of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days
during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months.

Section 5.3. _Automatic Shelf Registrations_. To the extent that the Company
qualifies as a well-known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act (a " _WKSI_ ") at the time of such Request, the Shareholder may
request that the Company file with

 



-16-  the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405
under the Securities Act) on Form F-3 (an " _Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement_ ") permitting the public resale of Registrable
Securities in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts and take all actions required or reasonably requested
by the Shareholder to maintain the effectiveness of such Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement in accordance with the requirements of the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and subject to the
Blackout Periods set forth in _Section 5.2_. At the time any Request for a
Demand Registration or Shelf Registration is submitted to the Company on or
after the date of this Agreement and, pursuant to such Request,
the Shareholder requests, in accordance with this _Section 5.3_, that the
Company file an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall file
an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder,
which covers those Registrable Securities that are requested to be registered.
At the written request of the Shareholder, the Company shall pay the
registration fee with respect to a take-down from an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement promptly and, in any event, within the time period
required by applicable Law after receiving such written request. So long as
the Shareholder is entitled to registration rights pursuant to this _Article
5_ , the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to remain a WKSI and
not to become an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act). If, at any time following the filing of an Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement when the Company is required to re-evaluate its
WKSI status, the Company determines that it is not a WKSI, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to post-effectively amend the Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement to a Registration Statement or Shelf Registration
Statement on Form F-3 or file a new Shelf Registration Statement on Form F-3,
have such Shelf Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and keep
such Shelf Registration Statement effective during the period in which such
Shelf Registration Statement is required to be kept effective in accordance
with this _Article 5_.

 

Section 5.4. _Selection of Underwriters; Underwritten Offering_. If the
Shareholder so notifies the Company in writing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause a Demand Registration or Shelf Registration
to be in the form of an underwritten offering. In connection with any
underwritten Demand Registration or Shelf Registration, (a) the Shareholder
shall have the right to select the bookrunners, subject to the bookrunners
being nationally recognized investment banks reasonably acceptable to the
Company, (b) the Company shall have the right to select one bookrunner,
subject to the bookrunner being a nationally recognized investment bank
reasonably acceptable to the Shareholder, (c) each of the Shareholder and the
Company shall have the right to select other non-bookrunning underwriters,
subject to each such other non-bookrunning underwriter being a nationally
recognized investment bank reasonably acceptable to the other Party, the
number of which to be selected by each Party to be jointly determined by the
Parties or, in the absence of agreement by the Parties, by the managing
underwriter selected by the Shareholder, acting reasonably, (d) the managing
underwriter selected by the Shareholder shall have primary authority and
responsibility to direct the administration of the offering and (e)
the underwriters selected by the Company shall collectively receive 33% of
the underwriting commissions and other fees in respect of such Demand
Registration or Shelf Registration. In connection with any Piggyback
Registration that is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the
Company in which Registrable Securities requested to be included represent at
least 10% of the number of securities to be included in the offering, (i) the
Shareholder shall have the right to select a joint lead bookrunner to
administer

 



-17-  the offering, subject to such joint lead bookrunner being a nationally
recognized investment bank reasonably acceptable to the Company, and (ii) the
joint lead bookrunner selected by the Shareholder shall receive a percentage
of the underwriting commissions and other fees in respect of such Piggyback
Registration equal to the percentage of Registrable Securities included in
such Piggyback Registration (but in no event more than 50% of such
commissions and fees); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
managing underwriter selected by the Company shall have primary authority and
responsibility to direct the administration of the offering. The Shareholder
may not participate in any registration under this Agreement which is
underwritten unless the Shareholder agrees to sell the Registrable Securities
held by the Shareholder on the basis provided in any underwriting agreement
with the underwriters and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers
of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

 

Section 5.5. _Piggyback Registrations_.

 

(a) If the Company determines to register any of its securities either for its
own account or the account of a security holder or holders, other than a
registration pursuant to _Section 5.1_, a registration relating solely to any
employee or director equity or equity-based incentive or compensation plan or
arrangement or any similar employee or director compensation or benefit plan,
a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt securities, a
registration relating solely to a corporate reorganization (including by way
of merger of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any other business)
or acquisition of another business, or a registration on any registration
form that does not permit secondary sales (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "),
the Company shall (i) promptly give written notice of the proposed
Piggyback Registration to the Shareholder and (ii) subject to _Section
5.5(b)_ and _Section 5.5(c)_, include in such Piggyback Registration and in
any underwriting involved therein (whether prior to or following the
expiration of the Lock-Up Period) all of such Registrable Securities as are
specified in a written request or requests (" _Piggyback Requests_ ") made by
the Shareholder received by the Company within ten (10) Business Days after
such written notice from the Company is given to the Shareholder. Such
Piggyback Requests shall specify the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be disposed of by the Shareholder.

 

(b) If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten primary registration on
behalf of the Company, and the managing underwriters advise the Company in
writing that in their opinion the aggregate number of securities requested to
be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an
orderly manner in such offering without adversely affecting the success of
such offering (including an adverse effect on the offering price), the
Company shall include in such registration only such securities as the Company
is advised by such managing underwriters can be sold without such an effect,
which securities shall be included in the following order of priority:

(i) first, the securities the Company proposes to sell,

 

(ii) second, the securities requested to be included in such registration by
the holders of Registrable Securities and holders that are contractually
entitled to include such securities therein pursuant to any written agreement
entered into by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Other
Registrable Securities_ "), pro rata on the basis of the number of
Registrable Securities and Other Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such registration and

(iii) third, any other securities requested to be included in such
registration.

 



-18- (c) If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on
behalf of any holder of Other Registrable Securities, and the managing
underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of
securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number
which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering without adversely
affecting the success of such offering (including an adverse effect on the
offering price), the Company shall include in such registration only such
securities as can be sold without such an effect, which securities shall be
included in the following order of priority: (i) first, the Other Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration, (ii) second, the
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration
and (iii) third, any other securities requested to be included in such
registration.

(d) The Company and any holder of Other Registrable Securities initiating any
registration shall have the right to, in its sole discretion, defer, terminate
or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this _Section 5.5_ whether
or not the Shareholder has elected to include any Registrable Securities in
such registration. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in the event
that the SEC or applicable federal securities Laws and regulations prohibit
the Company from including all of the Registrable Securities requested by the
Shareholder to be registered in a registration statement pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_, then the Company shall be obligated to include in such
registration statement only such portion of the Registrable Securities as is
permitted by the SEC or such federal securities Laws and regulations.

Section 5.6. _Withdrawals_. The Shareholder may withdraw all or any part of
the Registrable Securities from a Registration Statement at any time prior to
the effective date of such Registration Statement. If such withdrawal is made
(i) primarily as a result of the failure of the Company to comply with
any provision of this Agreement, (ii) during any postponement described in
_Section 5.2_; or (iii) based upon (A) any fact, circumstance, event, change,
effect or occurrence that individually or in the aggregate with all
other facts or circumstances, events, changes, effects or occurrences has a
material adverse effect on the Company or (B) material adverse information
concerning the Company that the Company had not publicly disclosed at least
forty-eight (48) hours prior to such registration request or that the Company
had not otherwise notified, in writing, the Shareholder of at the time of such
request, the Company shall be responsible for the payment of all Registration
Expenses in connection with such registration and such registration shall not
count as a Demand Registration for purposes of _Section 5.1_. In the case of
any other withdrawal, the Shareholder shall pay for the Registration Expenses
associated with the withdrawn registration.

Section 5.7. _Registration Procedures_. Whenever the Shareholder has made a
Request in accordance with _Section 5.1_ that any Registrable Securities be
registered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall:

 

(a) as expeditiously as reasonably practicable after the receipt by the
Company of such a Request, prepare and file with the SEC a Required
Registration

 



-19-  Statement or Required Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be,
providing for the registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable
Securities which the Company has been so requested to register in accordance
with the intended methods of distribution thereof specified in such Request,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to have such Required Registration
Statement or Required Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be,
declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable thereafter and subject to
the Blackout Periods set forth in _Section 5.2_, to keep such Required
Registration Statement or Required Shelf Registration Statement, as the case
may be, continuously effective (i) in the case of a Demand Registration, for
a period of at least ninety (90) calendar days (or, in the case of an
underwritten offering, such period as the underwriters may reasonably require)
following the date on which such Required Registration Statement is declared
effective (or such shorter period which shall terminate when all of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Required Registration Statement have
been sold pursuant thereto) or (ii) in the case of a Shelf Registration,
until such time as all Registrable Securities covered by such Required Shelf
Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto, including, in either
case, if necessary, by filing with the SEC a post-effective amendment or a
supplement to the Required Registration Statement or Required Shelf
Registration Statement or the related prospectus or any document incorporated
therein by reference or by filing any other required document or otherwise
supplementing or amending the Required Registration Statement or Required
Shelf Registration Statement, if required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such
Required Registration Statement or Required Shelf Registration Statement or
by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities or blue sky
Laws, or any rules and regulations thereunder;

 

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect
to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement
for the period set forth in (a) above;

 

(c) furnish to the Shareholder such number of copies of such Registration
Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included in
such Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and such
other documents as the Shareholder may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by
the Shareholder;

(d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under such other securities or blue sky Laws of such jurisdictions
in the United States as the Shareholder reasonably requests and do any and all
other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable
the Shareholder to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the
Registrable Securities owned by the Shareholder (it being understood that the
Company shall be under no obligation to register or qualify the Ordinary
Shares or ADSs under Israeli or other Laws of jurisdictions outside the
United States); _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to (i)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify, (ii) consent to general service of process
in any such jurisdiction or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any
jurisdiction where it is not so subject;

 



-20- (e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into an
underwriting agreement or similar agreement, in usual and customary form,
with the managing underwriters of such offering and use reasonable best
efforts to take such other actions as the managing underwriters reasonably
request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities, including causing its senior officers to participate
in "road shows" and other information meetings organized by the managing
underwriters;

 

(f) notify the Shareholder, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any
event as a result of which the prospectus included in such Registration
Statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact
necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, and in such case,
subject to _Section 5.2_, the Company shall promptly prepare a supplement or
amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the holders
of Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to
make the statements therein, not misleading;

(g) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities
which are registered to be listed on each securities exchange on which the
ADSs representing the Ordinary Shares are then listed and to be eligible and
remain eligible for registration of the ADSs pursuant to Form F-6;

(h) cooperate with the Shareholder and the Depositary to facilitate
the timely delivery of ADSs (in book entry or certificated form) to be
delivered to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement, which ADSs
shall be free of all restrictive legends;

 

(i) enter into such customary agreements and use reasonable best efforts to
take all such other actions as the Shareholder or the underwriters, if any,
reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities;

 

(j) make available for inspection by the Shareholder, any underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement and
any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Shareholder or any
underwriter, financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Companys officers, directors, employees and
independent accountants to supply all other information reasonably requested
by the Shareholder or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in
connection with such Registration Statement;

(k) if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten offering, use reasonable best
efforts to obtain "comfort" letters dated the pricing date of the offering of
the Registrable Securities and the date of the closing under the underwriting
agreement from the 

 



-21-  Companys independent public accountants in customary form and covering such
matters of the type customarily covered by "comfort" letters in connection
with underwritten offerings as the managing underwriter reasonably requests;

(l) use reasonable best efforts to furnish, at the request of the Shareholder
on the date such securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale
pursuant to such registration or are otherwise sold pursuant thereto, an
opinion and a "10b-5" letter, dated such date, of counsel representing the
Company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters
covering such legal and other matters with respect to the registration in
respect of which such opinion is being given and such letter is being
delivered as the underwriters may reasonably request and are customarily
included in such opinions and letters;

(m) subject to _Section 5.2_, use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement registering such Registrable Securities;

 

(n) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security holders,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective date of the Registration
Statement, an earnings statement covering the period of at least 12 months
beginning with the first day of the Companys first full calendar quarter
after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings
statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act
and Rule 158 thereunder;

 

(o) reasonably cooperate with the Shareholder and each underwriter
participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and their
respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with
FINRA;

(p) notify in writing the Shareholder and the underwriter, if any, of the
following events as promptly as reasonably practicable:

(i) the effectiveness of any such Registration Statement;

(ii) any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Registration
Statement or the prospectus or for additional information and when same has
been filed and become effective;

 

(iii) the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings by any
Person for that purpose; and

(iv) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for the sale
under the securities or blue sky Laws of any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for such purpose;

 



-22- (q) to the extent reasonably required in writing by the lead
managing underwriters with respect to an underwritten offering relating to
the registration of Equity Securities having an aggregate value of at least
$200,000,000, agree, and cause the directors or officers of the Company to
agree, to enter into customary agreements restricting the sale or
distribution of Equity Securities during the period commencing on the date of
the request (which shall be no earlier than fourteen (14) calendar days prior
to the expected "pricing" of such underwritten offering) and continuing for
not more than ninety (90) calendar days after the date of the "final"
prospectus (or "final" prospectus supplement if the underwritten offering is
made pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement), pursuant to which such
underwritten offering shall be made, plus an extension period, as may be
proposed by the lead managing underwriters to address FINRA regulations
regarding the publishing of research, or such lesser period as is required by
the lead managing underwriters; and

(r) use reasonable best efforts to take all other steps reasonably necessary
to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities contemplated hereby.

If any such registration or comparable statement refers to the Shareholder by
name or otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Company and if the
Shareholder is or would be reasonably expected to be deemed to be a
controlling person of the Company, the Shareholder shall have the right to
require (i) the insertion therein of language, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Shareholder and presented to the Company in writing, to
the effect that the holding by the Shareholder of such securities is not to be
construed as a recommendation by the Shareholder of the investment quality of
the Companys securities covered thereby and that such holding does not imply
that the Shareholder shall assist in meeting any future financial requirements
of the Company or (ii) in the event that such reference to the Shareholder by
name or otherwise is not required by the Securities Act or any similar federal
statute then in force, the deletion of the reference to the Shareholder;
_provided_ that with respect to this clause (ii) the Shareholder must furnish
to the Company an opinion of counsel to such effect, which opinion and counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company. In connection with any
Registration Statement in which the Shareholder is participating, the
Shareholder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information and
affidavits as the Company reasonably may from time to time reasonably request
specifically for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
prospectus.

Upon notice by the Company to the Shareholder of any Blackout Period, the
Shareholder shall keep the fact of any such notice strictly confidential, and
during any Blackout Period, discontinue its offer and disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement and
the prospectus relating thereto for the duration of the Blackout Period set
forth in such notice (or until such Blackout Period shall be earlier
terminated in writing by the Company) and, if so directed by the Company,
shall deliver to the Company any copies then in its possession of any such
prospectus or prospectus supplement. The Shareholder agrees that upon receipt
of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in clauses (f), (o)(ii), (o)(iii) or (o)(iv) above, it shall
forthwith discontinue its offer and disposition of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement and the prospectus relating
thereto until its receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by clause (o)(ii), or until it is advised in writing
by the Company that

 



-23-  the use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies
of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to
be incorporated by reference in such prospectus; _provided_ that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to supplement or amend the applicable
Registration Statement and prospectus as promptly as practicable and shall
extend the time periods under clause (a) above with respect to the length of
time that effectiveness of a Registration Statement must be maintained by the
amount of time that the Shareholder is required to discontinue disposition of
such Registrable Securities.

 

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form F-6 which registers
a number of ADSs that is sufficient to allow the Shareholder to exercise its
rights under, and sell its Registrable Securities in the United States in the
manner contemplated by, this Agreement.

 

Section 5.8. _Registration Expenses_. Subject to _Section 6.6_, all expenses
of the Company incident to the Companys performance of or compliance with
this _Article 5_ , including all registration and filing fees, fees and
expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky Laws, printing expenses,
messenger and delivery expenses, the Companys internal expenses (including
all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the
expense of any liability insurance, the expenses and fees for listing
the securities to be registered on each securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed and fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company and all independent certified public accountants
retained by the Company (all such expenses being herein called "
_Registration Expenses_ "), shall be borne by the Company. The Shareholder
shall pay all fees, costs and expenses of its counsel, accountants, advisers
or representatives and all expenses of any brokers commission or
underwriters discount or commission relating to the registration and sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9. _Requested Information_. Not less than five (5) Business Days
before the expected filing date of each Registration Statement pursuant to
this Agreement, the Company shall notify each holder of Registrable Securities
who has timely provided the requisite notice hereunder entitling such holder
to register Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement of the
information, documents and instruments from such holder that the Company or
any underwriter reasonably requests in connection with such Registration
Statement, including a questionnaire, custody agreement, power of attorney,
lock-up letter and underwriting agreement, each in customary form reasonably
acceptable to such holders (the " _Requested_ _Information_ "). If the Company
has not received, on or before the second Business Day before the expected
filing date, the Requested Information from such holder, the Company may file
the Registration Statement without including Registrable Securities of such
holder. The failure to so include in any Registration Statement the
Registrable Securities of a holder of Registrable Securities (with regard to
that Registration Statement) shall not result in any liability on the part of
the Company to such holder.

 

Section 5.10. _Holdback Agreements_. The Shareholder agrees to enter into
customary agreements restricting the sale or distribution of Equity
Securities (including sales pursuant to Rule 144) to the extent reasonably
required in writing by the lead managing underwriters with respect to an
applicable underwritten primary offering on behalf of the 

 



-24-  Company relating to the registration of Equity Securities having an
aggregate value of at least $200,000,000 during the period commencing on the
date of the request (which shall be no earlier than fourteen (14) calendar
days prior to the expected "pricing" of such underwritten offering) and
continuing for not more than ninety (90) calendar days after the date of the
"final" prospectus (or "final" prospectus supplement if the underwritten
offering is made pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement), pursuant to
which such underwritten offering shall be made, plus an extension period, as
may be proposed by the lead managing underwriters to address FINRA
regulations regarding the publishing of research, or such lesser period as is
required by the lead managing underwriters. The Shareholder shall not be
required to enter into a holdback agreement pursuant to this  _Section 5.10_
(a) at any time when the aggregate number of Ordinary Share Equivalents
Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder and its Group Members, as a group, is
less than 10% of the Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding and (b) unless
the directors and executive officers of the Company and all other 10% or
greater shareholders that are party to shareholder, registration rights or
similar agreements with the Company or that have a representative on the Board
of Directors are subject to substantially comparable restrictions. The
postponement rights in clause (b) of the first sentence in _Section 5.2_ and
the holdback obligation in this _Section 5.10_ shall not be applicable to
the Shareholder for more than a total of one hundred eighty (180) calendar
days during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months.

 

Section 5.11. _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available to the
Shareholder the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which
may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without
registration, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to:

 

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under
the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of the first
registration filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the
general public;

 

(b) file with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents
required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and 

(c) so long as the Shareholder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to the
Shareholder promptly upon request (i) a written statement by the Company as
to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 of the
Securities Act and of the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent
periodic report of the Company filed with the SEC and (iii) such other
reports and documents as the Shareholder may reasonably request in connection
with availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing it to sell
any such securities without registration, in each case to the extent not
readily publicly available.

Section 5.12. _Company Indemnification_. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Shareholder,
its Affiliates and each of its and their respective directors, officers,
partners, members and agents and directors and each Person, if any, who
controls the Shareholder (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act) from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses whatsoever (including reasonable, documented out-of-
pocket expenses of investigation and 

 



-25-  reasonable, documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses) caused
by, arising out of or relating to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto covering
the resale of any Registrable Securities by or on behalf of the Shareholder
or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except
insofar as such untrue statement or omission is based on information contained
in any affidavit or statement so furnished in writing by the Shareholder
expressly stated to be used in connection with such Registration Statement.

 

Section 5.13. _Shareholder Indemnification_. The Shareholder and any Permitted
Transferees jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company, its Affiliates, its and
their respective directors, officers, partners, members and agents and each
Person, if any, who controls the Company (within the meaning of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable, documented
out-of-pocket expenses of investigation and reasonable, documented out-of-
pocket attorneys fees and expenses) caused by, arising out of or relating to
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the
Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto covering the resale of any Registrable
Securities by or on behalf of the Shareholder or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by the Shareholder expressly stated to be used in
connection with such Registration Statement.

Section 5.14.  _Resolution of Claims_. Any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article 5_ shall give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying Party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification; _provided_ that the failure so to notify the indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of any liability that it may
have to the indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that the
indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits substantive
rights or defenses by reason of such failure. If notice of commencement of any
such action is given to the indemnifying Party as above provided, the
indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it
may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying Party similarly notified, to
assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by
it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. The indemnified
party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (a) the indemnifying Party
agrees to pay the same, (b) the indemnifying Party fails to assume the
defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party or (c) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded
parties) include both the indemnifying Party and the indemnified party and
such parties have been advised by such counsel that either (i) representation
of such indemnified party and the indemnifying Party by the same counsel would
be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (ii)
it is reasonably foreseeable that there will be one or more material legal
defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying Party. In any of such
cases, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of such action with its own counsel, the reasonable, documented out-
of-pocket fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the indemnifying Party,
it 

 



-26-  being understood, however, that the indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in
addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. No indemnifying
Party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). No indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of
such indemnified party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is a party and indemnity
has been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement
(x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all
liability for claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y)
does not include an omission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on
behalf of any indemnified party.

Section 5.15. _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in _Section
5.12_ or _Section 5.13_ is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities referred to herein, the indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted
by applicable Law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying Party on
the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with such
loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying Party and of
the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of Law by reference to,
among other things, if it relates to an untrue or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact or the omission to state a material fact in a Registration
Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereof covering the resale of any Registrable Securities by or on
behalf of the holder of Registrable Securities, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the indemnifying Party or by the
indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any loss, claim, damage
or liability referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to
the limitations set forth in this _Section 5.15_, any legal or other fees,
charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. The Parties agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 5.15_ were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _Section 5.15_.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

Section 5.16. _Company Facilitation of Sale_. If any Registrable Securities
are certificated and bear any restrictive legend, or are held in non-
certificated book-entry form and are subject to any stop transfer or similar
instruction or restriction, the Company shall upon the request of the holder
of such Registrable Securities, as applicable, promptly cause such legends to
be removed and new certificates without any restrictive legends to be issued
or cause such stop transfer or similar instructions or restrictions to be
promptly terminated and removed if (a) such Registrable Securities have been
resold pursuant to an effective Registration Statement or (b) the holder of
such Registrable Securities provides the Company, transfer agent and/or

 



-27-  Depositary, as applicable, with reasonable assurance that such Registrable
Securities can be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 or
otherwise without registration and without any restriction whatsoever under
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and applicable Israeli
securities laws, including, if requested by the Company, an opinion of outside
legal counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Company, transfer agent and/or
Depositary, as applicable, to such effect.

Section 5.17. _Transfers._ To the extent that any Registrable Securities
are Transferred, the obligations of the Company shall not be expanded in any
respect and, the registration rights provided for in this Article 5, to the
extent assigned, shall be shared by all holders of Registrable Securities and
all such persons shall be jointly and severally liable for any obligations.

ARTICLE 6

the aggregate at least 1% of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.

Section 6.4. _Counterparts; Entire Agreement; Corporate Power; Facsimile
Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all
of which shall be

 



-29-  considered one and the same agreement. This Agreement and the Schedules
hereto contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, supersede all previous agreements, negotiations,
discussions, writings, understandings, commitments and conversations with
respect to such subject matter and there are no agreements or understandings
between the Parties other than those set forth or referred to herein

confirms a stamp or mechanical signature (regardless of whether delivered in
person, by mail, by courier, by facsimile or by email in portable document
format (PDF)) made in its respective name as if it were a manual signature
delivered in person, agrees that it shall not assert that any such signature
or delivery is not adequate to bind such Party to the same extent as if it
were signed manually and delivered in person and agrees that, at the
reasonable request of the other Party at any time, it shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable cause this Agreement to be manually executed (any such
execution to be as of the date of the initial date thereof) and delivered in
person, by mail or by courier.

 

Section 6.5. _Amendments and Waivers_. No provision of this Agreement may be
waived, modified, supplemented or amended except in a written instrument
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and the Shareholder or, in
the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom enforcement of any such waived
provision is sought. No waiver of any default with respect to any provision,
condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing
waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any
other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or
omission of any Party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair
the exercise of any such right.

Section 6.6. _Successors and Assigns_. (a) Subject to clauses (b) and (c)
below, this Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

(a) The Company may not assign or delegate this Agreement or any rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Shareholder;
_provided_ that no such consent shall be required for any assignment by the
Company of its rights or obligations hereunder in connection with a merger,
consolidation, combination, reorganization or similar transaction or the
transfer, sale, lease, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all
of its assets.

(b) The Shareholder may not assign or delegate this Agreement or any rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company;
_provided_ that no such consent shall be required for (i) subject to Section
6.6(d), any assignment by the Shareholder of its rights or obligations
hereunder in connection with a merger, consolidation, combination,
reorganization or similar transaction or the transfer, sale, lease, conveyance
or disposition of all or substantially all of its assets, if such assignee
agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement or (ii) the
assignment or delegation by the Shareholder of any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to a Permitted Transferee, if such Permitted
Transferee agrees

 



-30-  in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall together
with the Shareholder and any prior Permitted Transferees shall be deemed the
Shareholder; _provided_ further that no such assignment or delegation shall
relieve the Shareholder of its obligations under this Agreement.

(c) Except as provided in Section 6.6(d), the covenants and agreements of the
Shareholder set forth in _Articles 2 and 3_ shall not be binding upon or
restrict any transferee of Shares other than Permitted Transferees in
accordance with  _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, or any transferee of Shares pursuant
to a Permitted Transfer in connection with which the Shareholders rights
under this Agreement are assigned to the transferee pursuant to _Section
6.6(b)_(i), and no transferee of Shares other than such Permitted Transferees
or a transfer of the Shareholders rights pursuant to _Section 6.6(b)(i)_
shall have any rights under this Agreement.

 

(d) The Shareholder will not enter into any transaction pursuant to which any
Person would become its ultimate parent entity (such that the Shareholder is
a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another Person or all or substantially all
of the Shareholders assets have been acquired by another Person) without
causing such Person to assume all of the Shareholders obligations under this
Agreement effective as of the consummation of such transaction.

Section 6.7. _Non-Affiliation_. From and after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall not and shall not cause, direct or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Group Members to (a) identify the Shareholder (or any one of
them) or any of its Affiliates (each, an " _Allergan Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Allergan Parties_ ") or otherwise hold any Allergan
Party out to be an Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
to the extent that such identification is required by applicable Law, by
virtue of the Shareholders Beneficial Ownership of all or a portion of the
Shares or other Equity Securities, and in such case only to the extent so
required by Law, or (b) make, enter into, modify or amend any Contract, other
than a Contract executed and delivered by any Allergan Party, that subjects
any Allergan Party or any of its assets or properties (other than the Shares
or other Equity Securities held by the Shareholder), tangible or intangible,
to any lien, encumbrance, claim, restriction or similar obligation or grants
or allows on or with respect to any such assets or properties any right of
use, exploitation, access or discovery to or in favor of any Person.

 

Section 6.8. _Acknowledgment of Securities Laws_. Each Party is aware, and
shall advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the securities laws
of the United States and Israel on the purchase or sale of securities by any
Person who has received material, nonpublic information from the issuer of
such securities and on the communication of such information to any other
person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to
purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.

 

Section 6.9. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly provided in
_Section 5.13_, _5.14_ , _5.15_ and  _5.16_ , this Agreement is intended for
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

Section 6.10. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or
circumstance is

 



-31-  determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement, or the
application of such term or provision to Persons or circumstances or in
jurisdictions other than those as to which it has been determined to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, and the Parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute one or more valid, legal
and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement which, insofar as
practicable, implement the purposes and intent of the Parties. Any term or
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part,
degree or within certain jurisdictions shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable to the extent consistent with
the intent of the Parties as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, each Party waives any term or provision of Law
which renders any term or provision of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect.

 

Section 6.11. _Business Days_. If the last or appointed day for the taking of
any action or the expiration of any right required or granted in this
Agreement is not a Business Day, then such action may be taken or such right
may be exercised on the next succeeding Business Day.

 

Section 6.12. _Governing Law and Venue: Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE
AND PROCEDURAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAW. The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of New York located in the City of New
York, Borough of Manhattan and the federal courts of the United States of
America for the Southern District with respect to all matters arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties agree that
all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined exclusively in such a New York state or federal court. The Parties
agree that a final judgment in any such any action, suit or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. The Parties consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such Parties solely for
such purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 6.3_ or in such other manner
as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service.

(b) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY

 



-32-  THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER. EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS _SECTION 6.12(b)_.

Section 6.13. _Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any court referred to in  _Section 6.12_, without proof
of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for such breach.
