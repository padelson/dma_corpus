AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of February 10, 2009, among Ticketmaster Entertainment, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Ticketmaster_ "), Live Nation, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Live Nation_ "), and, from and after its accession to this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.14_, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ ," together with Ticketmaster and Live Nation, the " _parties_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Ticketmaster and Live Nation has approved this Agreement, determined that the terms of this Agreement are in the best interests of Ticketmaster or Live Nation, as applicable, and their respective stockholders, and declared the advisability of this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Ticketmaster has recommended adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders, and the Board of Directors of Live Nation has recommended the approval of the Share Issuance by its stockholders and authorized the formation of Merger Sub, a wholly owned Subsidiary of Live Nation, in accordance with _Section 6.14_; 

   

 WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that: the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Ticketmaster and Live Nation desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
_The Merger_

  

 1.1 _ Formation of Merger Sub, Holdco1 and Holdco2._ Prior to the Effective Time, Live Nation shall form Merger Sub, Holdco1 and Holdco2 and cause Merger Sub to accede to this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.14. _

   

 1.2 _ The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Ticketmaster shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Ticketmaster shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ "). 

  

 1.3 _ Closing._ The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California at 10:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, on a date to be specified by Ticketmaster and Live Nation, which shall be no later than the 5th Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Ticketmaster and Live Nation. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 1.4 _ Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DLLCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time      
  

that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Ticketmaster and Live
Nation shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

 1.5 _ Effects._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 18-209 of the DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of Ticketmaster and Merger Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Ticketmaster and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company. 

  

 1.6 _ Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement._ At the Effective Time, the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended such that the name of the Surviving Company shall be "Ticketmaster Entertainment LLC," and, as so amended, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended so as to reflect the name of the Surviving Company as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, and, as amended, shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 1.7 _ Managers and Officers of Surviving Company._ The directors on the Board of Directors of Ticketmaster (the " _Ticketmaster Board_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the members of the Board of Managers of the Surviving Company at the Effective Time. Immediately following the Effective Time, the members of the Board of Managers of the Surviving Company shall nominate or appoint the persons set forth on _Ticketmaster Disclosure Schedule 1.7_ to serve as members of the Board of Managers of the Surviving Company effective at such time and Ticketmaster and Live Nation shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the directors of the Ticketmaster Board serving immediately prior to the Effective Time to resign from their positions as members of the Board of Managers of the Surviving Company effective immediately following such appointment or election. The officers of Ticketmaster immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 1.8 _ Alternative Structures._ The parties agree to reasonably cooperate in the consideration and implementation of alternative structures to effect the business combination contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, by merging Merger Sub with and into Ticketmaster, as long as such alternative structure does not (i) impose any material delay on, or condition to, the consummation of the Merger, (ii) cause any closing condition not to be capable of being fulfilled (unless duly waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof), or (iii) adversely affect any of the parties hereto or either Ticketmaster\'s or Live Nation\'s stockholders. 

  

ARTICLE II 
_Effect on the Capital Stock and Limited Liability Company Interests 
 of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of Certificates _

  

 2.1 _ Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Ticketmaster, Live Nation, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock or limited liability company interests in Merger Sub: 

  

  

 (a) _ Limited Liability Company Interests in Merger Sub._ All of the limited liability company interests in Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall constitute the only outstanding limited liability company interests in the Surviving Company. 

  

      

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Live Nation-Owned Stock._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Ticketmaster (the " _Ticketmaster Common Stock_ ") that is owned by Ticketmaster as treasury stock, if any, and each share of Ticketmaster Common Stock that is owned by Live Nation or Merger Sub, if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _ Conversion of Ticketmaster Common Stock._ Subject to _Section 2.2_, each share of Ticketmaster Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.384 fully paid and nonassessable shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, of Live Nation Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any shares of Ticketmaster Restricted Stock that are converted into the right to receive Live Nation Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Live Nation Common Stock that are subject to the same performance and/or continued service requirements applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time to the underlying shares of Ticketmaster Restricted Stock (if any). All such shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Live Nation (the " _Live Nation Common Stock_ "), to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of such Certificate (or shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Live Nation Common Stock or Ticketmaster Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Live Nation Common Stock or Ticketmaster Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Live Nation and the holders of Ticketmaster Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 (d) _ Adjustment to Exchange Ratio._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) the Exchange Ratio shall be automatically increased or decreased to the extent necessary (which adjusted Exchange Ratio shall be expressed to the thousandth of a share) in order that the aggregate number of whole shares of Live Nation Common Stock that the holders of securities representing 100% of the voting power of the Equity Interests of Ticketmaster issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are entitled to receive in the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ represents 50.01% of the voting power of the Equity Interests of Live Nation issued and outstanding immediately following the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, as so increased or decreased pursuant to this _Section 2.1(d)_, shall thereafter constitute the "Exchange Ratio" for purposes of determining the Merger Consideration to be issued to the holders of Ticketmaster Common Stock. 

  

  

 2.2 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Live Nation shall appoint the transfer agent for the Live Nation Common Stock, or a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to Live Nation and Ticketmaster to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an 

  

      

  

agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Live Nation and
Ticketmaster, for the issuance of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Live Nation shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates (or evidence of shares of Ticketmaster
Common Stock in book-entry form), for exchange in accordance with this
_Article II_ through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the
shares of Live Nation Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration
and cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.2(f)_. All such Live Nation Common Stock and cash deposited with
the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

  

 (b) _ Letter of Transmittal._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five Business Days after the final determination of the Exchange Ratio pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, Live Nation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Ticketmaster Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock held in book-entry form) as Live Nation may specify subject to Ticketmaster\'s reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto. 

  

 (c) _ Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange._ Upon (i) the surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Ticketmaster Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Ticketmaster, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Live Nation Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Ticketmaster Common Stock (or, if such Ticketmaster Common Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer), as the case may be, is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(c)_, each share of Ticketmaster Common Stock and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holders of shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock were entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock held in book-entry form). 

  

 (d) _ Treatment of Unexchanged Certificates and Shares._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Live Nation Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate (or shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock held in book-entry form) with respect to the shares of Live Nation 

  

      

  
  

Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
2.2(f)_, until the surrender of such Certificate (or shares of Ticketmaster
Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with this _Article II_.
Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate (or shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock held in book-entry
form), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole
shares of Live Nation Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Live Nation Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Live Nation Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Live Nation Common Stock. At the Effective Time, Live Nation agrees
that all holders of Ticketmaster Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically become and be treated for all purposes as
holders of Live Nation Common Stock with respect to the shares of Live Nation
Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration under this Agreement.

  

 (e) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Ticketmaster Common Stock._ The shares of Live Nation Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II _upon conversion of any shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock (or shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to Live Nation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II. _

  

 (f) _ No Fractional Shares._ No certificates representing fractional shares of Live Nation Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Ticketmaster Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock that are converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Live Nation Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of Live Nation Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Live Nation and Ticketmaster) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the Effective Time (the " _Live Nation Closing Price_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Live Nation of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. 

  

 (g) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Ticketmaster Common Stock for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Live Nation, upon demand, and any holder of Ticketmaster Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II _shall thereafter look only to Live Nation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_, in each case without any interest thereon, and Live Nation shall remain liable for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II. _

  

      

  

 (h) _ No Liability._ None of Ticketmaster, Live Nation, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates (or evidence of shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock in book-entry form) for five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Live Nation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (i) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Live Nation. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Live Nation. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Live Nation shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

   

 (j) _ Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Company, Live Nation and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Ticketmaster Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the applicable taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Ticketmaster Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

   

 (k) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Live Nation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Live Nation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof: 

    

 (i) each Ticketmaster Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an option (a " _Converted Live Nation Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Ticketmaster Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Live Nation Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock subject to such Ticketmaster Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding down to the nearest whole share, at a per share exercise price determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Ticketmaster Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Ticketmaster Stock Option (A) which is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the foregoing in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and (B) shall be adjusted in a manner which complies with Section 409A of the Code and that causes the resulting Converted Live Nation 

   

      

   

Options not to constitute the grant of a new option or a change in the form
of payment of an option, as provided under Treasury Regulation section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D);

  

 (ii) each award of Ticketmaster Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted, on the same terms and conditions applicable to such Ticketmaster Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time, into a number of restricted stock units corresponding to shares of Live Nation Common Stock (" _Converted Live Nation Restricted Stock Units_ ") determined by multiplying the number of shares of Ticketmaster Common Stock subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up or down to the nearest whole share; 

  

 (iii) each award of Ticketmaster Restricted Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted, on the same terms and conditions applicable to such Ticketmaster Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, into the number of shares of Live Nation Restricted Stock (" _Converted Live Nation Restricted Stock_ ") determined by multiplying the number of shares of Ticketmaster Restricted Stock subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up or down to the nearest whole share; and 

  

 (iv) each Ticketmaster Director Share Unit "account" (as defined under the Ticketmaster Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors) shall be converted, on the same terms and conditions applicable to such Ticketmaster Director Share Unit account immediately prior to the Effective Time, into an account of director share units corresponding to a number of shares of Live Nation Common Stock (" _Converted Live Nation Director Share Units_ ") determined by multiplying the number of Ticketmaster Director Share Units held in such account immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up or down to the nearest whole share. 

    

Prior to the Effective Time, the Ticketmaster Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as
are necessary, including without limitation providing any required notices
and obtaining any required consents (if any), to effectuate the provisions of
this _Section 2.3(a)_.

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, Live Nation shall assume all the obligations of Ticketmaster under the Ticketmaster Stock Plans, each outstanding Converted Live Nation Equity Award and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof, and the number and kind of shares available for issuance under each Ticketmaster Stock Plan shall be adjusted to reflect shares of Live Nation Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Ticketmaster Stock Plan. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Live Nation shall deliver to the holders of Converted Live Nation Equity Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights, and the original agreements evidencing the grants of such Converted Live Nation Equity Awards shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as those in effect prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section 2.3_ after giving effect to the Merger). 

  

 (c) Live Nation shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Live Nation Common Stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Converted Live Nation Equity Awards in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of shares of Live Nation Common Stock to be registered and issuable under Converted Live Nation Equity Awards, Live Nation shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Live Nation Common Stock subject to Converted Live Nation Equity Awards and shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or 

  

      

  
  

registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Converted Live Nation
Equity Awards remain outstanding.

 (c) any material change in financial accounting methods, by Live Nation or any Live Nation Subsidiary, except insofar as may have been required by a change in GAAP.

 (b) Neither Live Nation nor any Live Nation Subsidiary (i) is a party to or is bound by any material Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement other than the Tax Matters Agreement (the " _Live Nation Tax Matters Agreement_ ") by and among Clear Channel Communications Inc. (" _Live Nation Former Parent_ "), CCE Spinco, Inc. and CCE Holdco #2, Inc., dated as of December 21, 2005 or (ii) has any liability for Taxes of any Person (other than (A) Live Nation and the Live Nation Subsidiaries and (B) for Tax years during which Live Nation was a member of such group, the consolidated group whose common parent was Live Nation Former Parent) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of any state, local or foreign Law) as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

 (d) Since the date of the distribution by Live Nation Former Parent of all the stock of Live Nation to the shareholders of Live Nation Former Parent, neither Live Nation nor any Live Nation Subsidiary has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. To the knowledge of Live Nation, the distribution by Live Nation Former Parent of all the stock of Live Nation qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. Neither Live Nation, any Live Nation Subsidiary, nor any other person has taken or failed to take any action, which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to cause (A) such distribution not to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, (B) any stock or securities of Live Nation not to be treated as "qualified property" for purposes of Section 361(c)(2) of the Code, or (C) Live Nation or any of the Live Nation Subsidiaries to be liable for Additional Taxes or Distribution Taxes (as such terms are defined in the Live Nation Tax Matters Agreement).

 (e) Neither Live Nation nor any Live Nation Subsidiary has participated in any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). 

  

 (f) Neither Live Nation nor any Live Nation Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact or circumstance that would prevent or impede, or would be reasonably likely to prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 (f) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Live Nation Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Live Nation Benefit Plan and its related trust, insurance contract or other funding vehicle has been administered in accordance with its terms and is in compliance with ERISA, the Code and all other Laws applicable to such Live Nation Benefit Plan and (ii) Live Nation and each of the Live Nation Subsidiaries is in compliance with ERISA, the Code and all other Laws applicable to the Live Nation Benefit Plans. 

  

 (g) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Live Nation Material Adverse Effect, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Live Nation, threatened claims by or on behalf of any participant in any of the Live Nation Benefit Plans, or otherwise involving any such Live Nation Benefit Plan or the assets of any Live Nation Benefit Plan, other than routine claims for benefits. 

  

 (h) Except as set forth on _Live Nation Disclosure Schedule 3.10_, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Live Nation Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant of Live Nation or any of the Live Nation Subsidiaries to any compensation or benefit (other than severance or termination benefits that would become payable without regard to, and would not be enhanced by, the foregoing events), (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefits or trigger any other material obligation under any Live Nation Benefit Plan (other than severance or termination benefits that would become payable without regard to, and would not be enhanced by, the foregoing events), (C) result in any breach or violation of, default under or limit Live Nation\'s right to amend, modify or terminate any Live Nation Benefit Plan, or (D) result in the receipt of any amount (whether in cash, property, the vesting of property or otherwise) by any stockholder, employee, officer, director or other service provider of Live Nation or any Live Nation Subsidiary who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.280G-1), in any case, that could reasonably be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) that would result in any imposition of any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. 

  

 (i) No disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code for any amount paid or payable by Live Nation or any Live Nation Subsidiary as employee compensation, whether under any contract, plan, program or arrangement, understanding or otherwise, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Live Nation Material Adverse Effect.

Live Nation shall and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, and it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Live Nation Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Live Nation Acquisition Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to the extent that Live Nation is entitled to have such documents returned or destroyed, immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives, and, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, take such action as is reasonably necessary to enforce any "standstill" provisions or provisions of similar effect to which it is a party or of which it is a beneficiary. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.2(a)_, at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Live Nation Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Live Nation Acquisition Proposal that the Live Nation Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Live Nation Proposal, and which Live Nation Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section 5.2(a)_, Live Nation may, subject to compliance with _Section 5.2(d)_, (i) subject to applicable Law, furnish information with 

  

      

  
  

respect to Live Nation and the Live Nation Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Live Nation Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) ( _provided_
 that all such information has previously been provided to Ticketmaster or is
provided to Ticketmaster prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it
is provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (other
than with respect to standstill provisions), and (ii) participate
in discussions regarding the terms of such Live Nation Acquisition Proposal
and the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such
Live Nation Acquisition Proposal (and such Person\'s Representatives).

 (ii) (A) in response to a material development or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof (other than any fact, circumstance, effect, change, event or development specified in clauses _(i)_ through _(xiii)_ of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect") that was neither known to the Live Nation Board nor reasonably foreseeable at the date of this Agreement (and which change or development does not relate to a Live Nation Acquisition Proposal), the Live Nation Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that failure to make a Live Nation Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such change or development would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) Live Nation has notified Ticketmaster in writing, at least five Business 

   

      

   
  

Days in advance of such Live Nation Adverse Recommendation Change that it is
considering taking such action, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons

Ticketmaster shall and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, and it shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective

discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Ticketmaster Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Ticketmaster Acquisition Proposal,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to the extent that Ticketmaster is entitled to have such
documents returned or destroyed, immediately terminate all physical and
electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its

 (c) Except as set forth below in this _Section 5.3(c)_, neither the Ticketmaster Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Live Nation), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Live Nation), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Ticketmaster Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or recommendation that Ticketmaster stockholders adopt this Agreement or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Ticketmaster Acquisition Proposal (any action in clause _(i)_ or _(ii) _ being referred to as a " _Ticketmaster Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

considered any proposed written adjustments by Live Nation in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, should Live Nation elect to propose adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that, after giving effect
thereto, such Ticketmaster Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Ticketmaster Proposal and at the end of such five Business Day period
(as extended, if applicable) the Ticketmaster Board shall have determined, in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), that such Ticketmaster Acquisition
Proposal remains a Superior Ticketmaster Proposal after giving effect to all
of the adjustments (if any) which may be offered pursuant to this clause
_(D)_ ; or

   

 (ii) (A) in response to a material development or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof (other than any fact, circumstance, effect, change, event or development specified in clauses _(i)_ through _(xiii)_ of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect") that was neither known to the Ticketmaster Board nor reasonably foreseeable at the date of this Agreement (and which change or development does not relate to a Ticketmaster Acquisition Proposal), the Ticketmaster Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that failure to make a Ticketmaster Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such change or development would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) Ticketmaster has notified Live Nation in writing, at least five Business Days in advance of such Ticketmaster Adverse Recommendation Change that it is considering taking such action, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, and (C) during such five Business Day period, Ticketmaster has considered any proposed written adjustments by Live Nation in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, should Live Nation elect to propose adjustments in terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 (d) Live Nation shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Live Nation Stockholders Meeting for the purposes of seeking the Live Nation Stockholder Approval and any proposal to amend the Live Nation Stock Plan to increase the number of authorized shares of Live Nation Common Stock available for issuance thereunder.

Ticketmaster Board shall have made a Ticketmaster Adverse Recommendation
Change as permitted by _Section 5.3(c)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.1(e)_, if on a date for which the

received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Ticketmaster
Common Stock and Ticketmaster Series A Preferred Stock to obtain the
Ticketmaster Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present,

for the purpose of obtaining the Ticketmaster Stockholder Approval and, in
connection therewith, shall make one or more successive adjournments of the
Ticketmaster Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that the Ticketmaster
Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned to a date that is more than 30
days after the date for which the Ticketmaster Stockholders Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required
by applicable Law). Ticketmaster agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 6.1_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to Ticketmaster of any Ticketmaster
Acquisition Proposal or by the making of any Ticketmaster Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Ticketmaster Board; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the public announcement of a Ticketmaster Adverse Recommendation

If any material is withheld by such party pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Ticketmaster and Live Nation shall, within two Business Days of request by the other party therefor, provide to such other party the information described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any information to which a holder of Ticketmaster Common Stock or Live Nation Common Stock, as applicable, would be entitled under Section 220 of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of such section).

 (iv) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such registration, declaration, notice or filing and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in _Sections 6.3(b)_ and _6.3(d)_ ), and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other in connection with any such registration, declaration, notice, filing or communication; 

  

 (v) use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable under the circumstances to any reasonable inquiries received from any Governmental Entity or any other authority enforcing applicable antitrust, competition, investment, trade regulation or similar Laws for additional information or documentation in connection with antitrust, competition, investment, trade regulation or similar matters (including but not limited to any "second request" under the HSR Act), and not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or under any other antitrust, competition, investment, trade regulation or similar Law, or enter into any agreement with such Governmental Entities or other authorities not to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and 

   

      

   

 (vi) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, (A) to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in _Sections 6.3(b)_ and _6.3(d)_ ) without the other, (B) to the extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or communication, (C) in the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such communication, keep such party reasonably apprised with respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the preparation and filing of, including by permitting the other to review and discuss in advance and by considering in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or defending this Agreement and the Merger, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument, and/or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity, and (E) promptly furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one hand, and any members of any Governmental Entity\'s staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, except that any materials concerning valuation of the other party may be redacted or withheld. 

    

 (d) To the extent necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing, Ticketmaster and Live Nation shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to jointly negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by Ticketmaster, Live Nation or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any portion of the business, properties or assets of Ticketmaster, Live Nation or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Live Nation nor Ticketmaster shall (i) discuss with any Governmental Entity any of the foregoing actions outside the presence of the other unless required to do so by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, (ii) be required pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_ to commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or (iii) be required to agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action (" _Regulatory Conditions_ ") that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to materially impair the business operations of the Combined Company absent such Regulatory Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that (x) elimination of projected financial benefits and synergies anticipated to be achieved following the Merger shall not be a basis to assert under this _Section 6.3(d)_ that there may be a material impairment in the business operations of the Combined Company and (y) a material impairment is an effect on the business operations of the Combined Company that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. If the actions taken by Live Nation and Ticketmaster pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence do not result in the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ and _7.1(e)_ being satisfied, then each of Live Nation and Ticketmaster shall jointly (to the extent practicable) use their reasonable best efforts to initiate and/or participate in any proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, in order to (A) oppose or defend against any action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and/or (B) take such action as necessary to overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental Entity to block consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by defending any suit, action or other judicial or administrative proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any Legal Restraint resulting from any suit, action or other legal proceeding that would cause any condition set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ or _7.1(e)_ not to 

  

      

  

be satisfied; _provided_ that Live Nation and Ticketmaster shall cooperate
with one another in connection with, and shall jointly control, all

 9.3 _ Interpretation._ Where specific language is used to clarify by example a general statement contained herein (such as by using the word "including"), such specific language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the general statement to which it relates. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa. The words "include" and "including," and other words of similar import when used herein shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation but rather shall be deemed to be followed in each case by the words "without limitation." The word "if" and other words of similar import when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the phrase "and only if." The words "herein," "hereto," and "hereby" and other words of similar import in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision of this Agreement. Any reference herein to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States dollars. The words "as of the date of this Agreement" and words of similar import shall be deemed in each case to refer to the date of this Agreement as set forth in the Preamble hereto. The term "or" shall be deemed to mean "and/or." Any reference to any particular Code section or any other Law will be interpreted to include any revision of or successor to that section regardless of how it is numbered or classified and any reference herein to a Governmental Entity shall be deemed to include reference to any successor thereto. 

   

 9.4 _ Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties._ None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This _Section 9.4_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

 9.6 _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this _Section 9.6_ with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 9.7 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. 

  

 9.8 _ Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement, taken together with the Live Nation Disclosure Schedules and the Ticketmaster Disclosure Schedules, the exhibits hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) except for _Section 6.5_, is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies. 

  

 9.9 _ Governing Law._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. 

   

 9.10 _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 9.11 _ Specific Enforcement and Forum Selection._ The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if 

        
  

available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_,
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause (a)
below, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, each of
the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in Wilmington, Delaware or,
if exclusive jurisdiction of such matter is vested in the Federal courts, any
Federal court located in the State of Delaware, in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than those
specified in clause (a) of this _Section 9.11. _

  

 9.12 _ Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section 9.12. _

  

 9.13 _ Headings._ The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
