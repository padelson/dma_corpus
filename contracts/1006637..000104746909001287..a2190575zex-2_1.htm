of the time of effectiveness of the Form&nbsp;S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Merger Consideration for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction, and each of Ticketmaster and Live Nation shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of
Ticketmaster and Live Nation shall also take any other action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities
