(c) Any portion of the Aggregate Estimated Consideration deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ to pay for Dissenting Shares for
which appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent
or the Surviving Company upon the settlement or final and non-appealable
adjudication of any claim for appraisal rights asserted with respect to such
Dissenting Shares.

 



 

2.9 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent, the Exchange
Agent and the Shareholder Representative a written schedule setting forth the
applicable amount to be paid to each holder of Ordinary Shares, Options,
Incentive Shares and Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this _Section 2.9_
(the " _Payments Schedule_ ") and none of the Exchange Agent, the Parent, the
Surviving Company nor the Shareholder Representative shall have any liability
whatsoever related to or arising out of any errors in the calculations set
forth in such schedule. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, (i) with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Ordinary Shares and Options issued pursuant to the Performance Option

amount of the Aggregate Estimated Consideration minus the amount deposited

Fund_ "), (ii) with the Escrow Agent, the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback
Amount to be held in the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, (iii) with the Surviving Company, for the benefit of holders
of Options (other than Options issued pursuant to the Performance Option
Agreement), Incentive Shares and Restricted Stock Units, the portion of the
Aggregate Estimated Consideration payable to such holders and (iv) with the
Shareholder Representative, the Shareholder Representative Expense Amount
which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Shareholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto. All other fees, costs and
expenses of the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Agent will be paid by Parent.

 



 

(b) On or promptly following the Closing Date, the Shareholder Representative
and Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to pay from the Exchange Fund in
accordance with the Payments Schedule the Per Share Ordinary Share
Consideration for each Ordinary Share to each Ordinary Shareholder, and to the
holder of Options for each Option issued pursuant to the Performance Option
Agreement to each such holder, who has properly completed, duly executed and
delivered a Letter of Transmittal to the Company. The Shareholder
Representative and Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to make such payment
on the later of the Closing Date and two (2) Business Days after the delivery
of such Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

(c) On or promptly following the Closing Date, Parent shall direct the
Surviving Company to pay in accordance with the Payments Schedule provided by
the Surviving Company pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ to each holder of Options
(other than Options issued pursuant to the Performance Option Agreement),
Incentive Shares and Restricted Stock Units cash in an amount equal to the
consideration for each such outstanding Option, Incentive Share and Restricted
Stock Unit payable pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ who has properly completed,
duly executed and delivered a Letter of Transmittal to the Company. Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to make such payment on the first regularly
scheduled payroll date after the Closing Date subject to delivery of such
Letter of Transmittal no later than two (2) Business Days prior to such
payroll date.

 



 

(d) At the Closing, Parent shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, the amounts indicated in the Payoff Letters
as necessary to discharge fully the then outstanding balance of all Funded
Indebtedness set forth in the Payoff Letters, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) designated by the holders of such Funded
Indebtedness as set forth in the Payoff Letters.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) At the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, the Estimated Transaction Expenses that remain
unpaid as of the Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the payees indicated in invoices provided to Parent by the Company in support
of such Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(f) The following provisions shall be applicable to payment of the
consideration to which each Equityholder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.7_ (the " _Applicable Equityholder Consideration_ "):

 



 

(i) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will deliver or mail or will cause to be delivered or mailed to each holder of
Ordinary Shares and each holder of Options issued pursuant to the Performance
Option Agreement a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit D-1_ and to each holder of Equity Awards (other than Options issued
pursuant to the Performance Option Agreement) a letter of transmittal in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit D-2_, in each case with such changes as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request that are reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and Parent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that
delivery of the Applicable Equityholder Consideration shall be effected, only
upon proper delivery of a fully executed Letter of Transmittal in accordance
therewith to the Company or the Surviving Company, as applicable, and
instructions for use in completing such Letter of Transmittal and receiving
the Applicable Equityholder Consideration in respect of the Ordinary Shares,
Restricted Stock Units, Options or Incentive Shares.

 



 

(ii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the register of
members or books and records of the Surviving Company of any Ordinary Shares
or Equity Awards that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, valid evidence of ownership of Ordinary
Shares or Equity Awards is presented to and accepted by the Exchange Agent or
the Surviving Company (as applicable), such Ordinary Shares or Equity Awards
shall be deemed to be surrendered and canceled against delivery of the
Applicable Equityholder Consideration as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(iii) No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Applicable Equityholder
Consideration payable upon the delivery of the Letters of Transmittal. None of
Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be liable to any Equityholder for any cash or interest
thereon delivered to a public official pursuant to and as required by any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Ordinary Shareholders twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall, at Parents option, be paid to the Surviving
Company and such Ordinary Shareholders shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Company for payment of the Applicable Equityholder Consideration.

 



 

(iv) After the Effective Time, any holder of Ordinary Shares or Options issued
pursuant to the Performance Option Agreement will be entitled to look only to
the Exchange Agent for payment of their respective claims for the
consideration set forth in this _Article II_, without interest thereon, and
following any delivery of the balance of the Exchange Fund to the Surviving
Company, any Equityholder shall only be entitled to look to the Surviving
Company for payment of their respective claims for the consideration set forth
in this _Article II_, but will have no greater rights against the Surviving
Company than may be accorded to general creditors thereof under applicable
Law.

 



 

(v) The Exchange Agent shall hold any cash included in the Exchange Fund in a
non-interest bearing account.

 



     

 

 



 

(g) Promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following any
date on which the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Company has been paid any
amounts to be held for the benefit of Ordinary Shareholders, holders of
Options, holders of Incentive Shares and holders of Restricted Stock Units (as
applicable) pursuant to _Section 2.10(g)_ or _(h)_ , Shareholder
Representative and Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to pay in accordance with the Post-Closing
Payments Schedule the applicable amounts to be paid to such holders pursuant
to _Section 2.10(g)_ or _(h)_ for each such holder who has properly
completed, duly executed and delivered a Letter of Transmittal to the Company
or the Surviving Company; _provided_ that the Shareholder Representative shall
have delivered to Parent a written schedule setting forth the applicable
amount to be paid to each such holder (the " _Post-Closing Payments Schedule_
") and none of the Exchange Agent, the Shareholder Representative, Parent nor
the Surviving Company shall have any liability whatsoever related to or
arising out of any errors in the calculations set forth in such schedule to
the extent consistent with the Post-Closing Payments Schedule, and following
any delivery of the balance of the Exchange Fund to such holders, such holders
shall only be entitled to look to the Surviving Company for such payments
pursuant to _Section 2.10(g)_ or _(h)_.

 



 

(h) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any Liability to any Equityholder or holder of Preferred Shares with
respect to the Aggregate Estimated Consideration, the Aggregate Final
Consideration, the Aggregate Incentive Share Consideration or any other
amounts paid to the Exchange Agent, Escrow Agent, Shareholder Representative
or any third party, for any of their benefit or otherwise, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, other than the payment of the amounts to former
holders of Equity Awards set forth on the Payments Schedule or the Post-
Closing Payments Schedule (the preparation and delivery of which will be the
sole responsibility of the Company (prior to the Closing) and the Shareholder
Representative (after the Closing)), as applicable, and with respect to the
Surviving Company, any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to the Surviving
Company, at its election, following the one (1) year anniversary of the
Effective Time.

 



 

2.10 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , with respect to the delivery in clause (vi) of this _Section
2.10(a)_, at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver the supporting statement including preliminary estimates of the
applicable amounts referred to in clause (vi) below which shall be updated on
such third Business Day), the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the
" _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") that shall set forth a calculation of good
faith estimates of (or include) (i) the estimated amount of the Closing
Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital Amount_ "), (ii) the
estimated amount of Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing
Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the estimated amount of Closing Cash (the " _Estimated
Closing Cash_ ") (including the most recent bank statements (or electronic
statement) on which the good faith estimate of the Estimated Closing Cash was
based), (iv) the estimated amount of Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated
Transaction Expenses_ "), (v) the estimated amount of the Closing Net Tax
Asset Position (including a supporting statement in the form of _Schedule 1_
reflecting the amounts therein as of the Adjustment Time) (the " _Estimated
Closing Net Tax Asset Position")_ and (vi) the estimated amount of the Closing
Transaction Tax Benefit Amount (including a supporting statement in the form
of _Schedule 4_ and including confirmation in writing by a "Big Four" national
accounting firm that each of the Transaction Tax Deductions are deductible for
applicable income Tax purposes at a "more likely than not" level of comfort
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not require the delivery of a formal
opinion letter)) (the " _Estimated Closing Transaction Tax Benefit Amount_ "),
and its calculation of the Aggregate Estimated Consideration. If, following
receipt of the Estimated Closing Statement and the Incentive Share Payment
Schedule, Parent disagrees with any portion of the Estimated Closing Statement
or the Incentive Share Payment Schedule, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve Parents disagreements and the Estimated
Closing Statement and the Incentive Share Payment Schedule

 



     

 

 



 

shall be updated for any items resolved by Parent and the Company. If Parent
and the Company fail to resolve any of Parents disagreements prior to the
date by which the Closing is to occur as contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)_,
the Estimated Closing Statement and the Incentive Share Payment Schedule and
the calculations therein as originally delivered by the Company (as modified
by any items agreed to by Parent and the Company) shall be conclusive and
binding upon Parent for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Estimated
Consideration.

 



 

(b) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the " _Incentive Share Payment Schedule_
") setting forth the aggregate consideration payable to the Incentive Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and the consideration
payable in respect of each Incentive Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, in each case calculated in accordance with the terms of
the Articles of Association, the Incentive Share Plan and any applicable award
agreements and determined assuming the Company had distributed an amount of
cash to all holders of Ordinary Shares, Options, Incentive Shares and
Restricted Stock Units equal to the aggregate consideration payable to all
such holders as consideration in the Merger.

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, (A) Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Shareholder Representative a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") that shall set forth a calculation of (i) the Closing Working
Capital, (ii) the Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the Closing Cash, (iv) the
Transaction Expenses, (v) the Closing Net Tax Asset Position and (vi) the
Closing Transaction Tax Benefit Amount. The Estimated Closing Statement and
the Closing Statement shall entirely disregard any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into at any time by Parent or its Affiliates in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to Parent or any of
its assets or liabilities.

 



 

(d) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the Shareholder
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement (the " _Adjustment Review
Period_ "), the Shareholder Representative and its Representatives shall be
permitted to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries working papers and,
after signing a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Companys independent accountants,
the working papers of the Companys independent accountants, if any, relating
to the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Transaction Expenses,
Closing Net Tax Asset Position and Closing Transaction Tax Benefit Amount, and
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Representatives
to, reasonably cooperate with respect to the Shareholder Representatives
review (to the extent that it does not unreasonably interfere with the
Companys business). The Shareholder Representative shall notify Parent in
writing (the " _Notice of Adjustment Disagreement_ ") on or prior to the last
day of the Adjustment Review Period if the Shareholder Representative
disagrees with any portion of the Closing Statement. The Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement, the amounts involved and the Shareholder Representatives
adjustments to the Closing Statement with reasonably detailed supporting
documentation. If no Notice of Adjustment Disagreement is received by Parent
on or prior to the expiration date of the Adjustment Review Period, then the
Closing Statement and all amounts set forth therein shall be deemed to have
been accepted by the Shareholder Representative and shall become final and
binding upon the parties hereto. During the fifteen (15) days immediately
following the delivery of a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement (the "
_Adjustment Resolution Period_ "), the Shareholder Representative and Parent
shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement. Any
items agreed to by the Shareholder Representative and Parent in writing,
together with any items not disputed or objected to by the Shareholder
Representative in the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, are collectively
referred to herein as the " _Resolved Matters_." If at the end of the
Adjustment Resolution Period the parties have been

 



     

 

 



 

unable to resolve any differences they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, then either the
Shareholder Representative or Parent may refer all matters that remain in
dispute with respect to the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement (the "
_Unresolved Matters_ ") to Duff and Phelps, LLC (the " _Independent Accountant_
"). In the event that Duff and Phelps, LLC refuses or is otherwise unable to act
as the Independent Accountant, the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall
cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent certified public accounting
firm in the United States of national recognition mutually agreeable to the
Shareholder Representative and Parent, in which event "Independent Accountant"
shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30) days after the submission of such
matters to the Independent Accountant, the Independent Accountant, acting as
an expert and not as an arbitrator, will make a final determination, binding
on the parties hereto, of the appropriate amount of each of the Unresolved
Matters. With respect to each Unresolved Matter, such determination, if not in
accordance with the position of either the Shareholder Representative or
Parent, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the
amounts advocated by the Shareholder Representative in the Notice of
Adjustment Disagreement or Parent in the Closing Statement with respect to
such Unresolved Matter. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant
shall not review any line items or make any determination with respect to any
matter other than the Unresolved Matters. During the review by the Independent
Accountant, Parent and the Company shall each make available to the
Independent Accountant such information, books, records and work papers, as
may be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.10(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
independent accountants of Parent or the Company shall not be obligated to
make any working papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and
until the Independent Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and
hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated to and
borne by Parent, on the one hand, and the Shareholder Representative (on
behalf of the Equityholders), on the other hand, based on the inverse of the
percentage that the Independent Accountants determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the items in dispute as originally
submitted to the Independent Accountant. For example, should the items in
dispute total in amount equal to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards
$600 in favor of the Shareholder Representatives position, 60% of the costs
of its review would be borne by Parent and 40% of the costs would be borne by
the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders).

 



 

(e) The " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall be (i) in the event that no Notice
of Adjustment Disagreement is delivered by the Shareholder Representative to
Parent prior to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period, the Closing
Statement delivered by Parent to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to
_Section 2.10(c)_, (ii) in the event that a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement
is delivered by the Shareholder Representative to Parent prior to the
expiration of the Adjustment Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by
Parent to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_, as
adjusted pursuant to the agreement of Parent and the Shareholder
Representative in writing, or (iii) in the event that a Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement is delivered by the Shareholder Representative to Parent prior to
the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period and Parent and the Shareholder
Representative are unable to agree on all matters set forth in such Notice of
Adjustment Disagreement, the Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the
Shareholder Representative pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_ as adjusted by the
Independent Accountant to be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the
final determination of the Independent Accountant of the Unresolved Matters in
accordance with _Section 2.10(d)_. The date on which the Final Closing
Statement is finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.10(e)_ is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_."

 



 

(f) As of the Determination Date, the parties shall calculate the Aggregate
Final Consideration. The " _Aggregate Final Consideration_ " shall mean an
amount, expressed in U.S. dollars, consisting of (A) the Base Purchase Price,
_minus_ (B) the Closing Indebtedness as set forth in the Final

 



     

 

 



 

Closing Statement, _minus_ (C) the amount of Transaction Expenses (as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement), _minus_ (D) the amount, if any, by
which the Target Working Capital Amount exceeds the Closing Working Capital
(as set forth in the Final Closing Statement), _plus_ (E) the amount, if any,
by which the Closing Working Capital (as set forth in the Final Closing
Statement) exceeds the Target Working Capital Amount, _plus_ (F) the Closing
Cash as set forth in the Final Closing Statement, _plus_ (G) the amount of the
Closing Net Tax Asset Position (as set forth in the Final Closing Statement),
_plus_ (H) the amount of the Closing Transaction Tax Benefit Amount (as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement) _minus_ (I) the Aggregate Holdback
Amount, _minus_ (J) if the Preferred Share Redemption Value is not paid by the
Canadian Subsidiary or the Put Right Purchaser (as applicable) prior to the
Closing pursuant to _Section 5.6(d)_, the Preferred Share Redemption Value.

 



 

(g) If the Aggregate Final Consideration is less than the Aggregate Estimated
Consideration paid at the Closing (such difference, the " _Deficiency Amount_
"), the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent a joint written instruction to promptly (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the Determination Date) pay the Deficiency Amount to
Parent by wire transfer of same day funds from the Purchase Price Adjustment
Holdback Amount (as reduced by the Released Holdback Amount) held in the
Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that
Parents sole recourse with respect thereto shall be the Purchase Price
Adjustment Holdback Amount (as reduced by the Released Holdback Amount) held
in the Escrow Account. If the Aggregate Final Consideration is greater than
the Aggregate Estimated Consideration paid at the Closing (such difference,
the " _Excess Amount_ "), then (i) the Shareholder Representative and Parent
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to promptly (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date) pay
the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount by wire transfer of same day
funds to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Ordinary Shares
and Options issued pursuant to the Performance Option Agreement, and to the
Surviving Company, for the benefit of the holders of Options (other than
Options issued pursuant to the Performance Option Agreement), Incentive Shares
and Restricted Stock Units, to be distributed to such holders pursuant to
_Section 2.9_ and (ii) Parent shall promptly (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the Determination Date) pay the Excess Amount by wire
transfer of same day funds to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Ordinary Shares and Options issued pursuant to the Performance
Option Agreement, and to the Surviving Company, for the benefit of the holders
of Options (other than Options issued pursuant to the Performance Option
Agreement), Incentive Shares and Restricted Stock Units, to be distributed to
such holders pursuant to _Section 2.9_. For avoidance of doubt, any payments
made pursuant to this _Section 2.10(g)_ shall be denominated in U.S. dollars.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, immediately upon Parents delivery of the
Closing Statement, the Shareholder Representative shall be permitted to
deliver a written instruction to the Escrow Agent to distribute the portion of
Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount held in the Escrow Account that is
in excess of the "Deficiency Amount," assuming the Deficiency Amount was
calculated based on the amounts set forth by Parent in the Closing Statement
(such excess, the " _Released Holdback Amount_ "), to the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Ordinary Shares and Options issued pursuant to
the Performance Option Agreement, and to the Surviving Company, for the
benefit of holders of Options (other than Options issued pursuant to the
Performance Option Agreement), Incentive Shares and Restricted Stock Units, to
be distributed to such holders pursuant to _Section 2.9_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, other than the distribution of the Released
Holdback Amount pursuant to this _Section 2.10(h)_, the Escrow Agent shall
retain in the Escrow Account and shall not distribute any portion of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount prior to the sixth (6th) Business
Day after the Determination Date and the payment of all amounts required to be
paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.10(g)_ (or such earlier time as all
obligations of the Shareholder Representative under _Section 2.10(g)_ are
satisfied) and after such sixth (6th) Business Day the Shareholder
Representative and Parent shall submit a written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to distribute any remaining Purchase Price Adjustment

 



      

 

 



 

Holdback Amount to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Ordinary Shares and Options issued pursuant to the Performance Option
Agreement, and to the Surviving Company, for the benefit of holders of Options
(other than Options issued pursuant to the Performance Option Agreement),
Incentive Shares and Restricted Stock Units, to be distributed to such holders
pursuant to _Section 2.9_.

 



 

2.11 _Withholding_. Parent and the Company (and any Affiliate thereof) will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Company (or any Affiliate thereof) are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of applicable Law; _provided_ that,
except with respect to payments made pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ to holders
of Equity Awards who are Canadian residents neither Parent nor the Company has
any current intention to withhold any amounts payable to the holders of
Ordinary Shares or Incentive Shares pursuant this _Section 2.11_ and shall
promptly notify the Shareholder Representative in the event that Parent or the
Company determines that it is required to make such withholdings and shall
reasonably cooperate with the Shareholder Representative to establish an
applicable exemption from such withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Company (and any Affiliate thereof), such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made.

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company is US$500,000 divided into
35,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 15,000,000 Incentive Shares. As of the date
hereof, (i) 24,714,781.90 Ordinary Shares and 2,007,980 Incentive Shares are
issued and outstanding, (ii) no Ordinary Shares or Incentive Shares are held
by the Company in its treasury, (iii) 1,073,514 Ordinary Shares are subject to

(b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth, as of the
date hereof, a true and complete list of all holders of outstanding (i)
Ordinary Shares, including the number of Ordinary Shares held by such holders,

the Options and Restricted Stock Units as provided in this Agreement without
the consent or approval of the holders of such securities. Each Option granted
to any current or former employee, independent contractor or consultant has an
exercise price that is no less than the fair market value of the Ordinary

ARTICLE IV

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 



 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedules_ ") (each section or subsection of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant if specified
therein and any such other representations, warranties or covenants where its
applicability to, relevance as an exception to, or disclosure for purposes of,
such other representation, warranty or covenant is reasonably apparent on its
face), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing to the Company and the Shareholder
Representative that:

 



     

 

 



 

4.1 _Due Organization_. Parent and Merger Sub are each a corporation, exempted
company, limited liability company or other legal entity duly incorporated or
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, and have all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Parent and Merger Sub are duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing (to the extent that such
concept or a comparable status is recognized) in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification required by Law, except where the failure to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
Merger Sub have all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
their properties and assets and to carry on their business as now being
conducted and are qualified to do business and each is in good standing as a
foreign Person in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its properties or assets or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.2 _Due Authorization_. Parent and Merger Sub have all requisite power and
authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform their obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and no other corporate
actions or proceedings on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or their shareholders
is necessary to authorize this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. The board of directors of Parent has adopted resolutions (i) approving
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Plan of
Merger, (ii) determining that entering into this Agreement and the Plan of
Merger is in the best interests of Parent and its shareholders, and (iii)
declaring this Agreement and the Plan of Merger advisable. Parent and Merger
Sub have duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement. This
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent
and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception.

 



 

4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for (a) filings under
_Section 2.3_, (b) filings under the HSR Act, and (c) as set forth in Section
4.2 of the Parent Disclosure Schedules, the execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) violate any Law applicable
to Parent or any of its Affiliates (including Merger Sub); (ii) require any
notification to or filing or registration by Parent or Merger Sub or any of
Parents other Affiliates with, or any permit, authorization, waiting period
expiration or termination, or consent or approval with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub or any of Parents other Affiliates of, or other action by, any
Governmental Authority; (iii) violate or conflict with any provision of the
Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (iv) violate, conflict with,
result in a breach of, constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time
or both) a default under, result in, or provide the basis for, the termination
or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by or excuse
performance by any Person, of any obligation, or cause the acceleration of the
maturity of any Indebtedness or create in any party the right to accelerate,
terminate, modify, suspend, revoke, cancel or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit under, or require any notice, payment,
consent or waiver or other action by any Person under, section 233(8) of the
Companies Law, any provision of any material contract or any material Permit
affecting the assets or business of Parent or Merger Sub; or (v) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien other than Permitted Liens on any
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the
case of clauses (i), (ii), (iv) and (v), where any such violation, conflict,
breach or default would not be reasonably expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.4 _Brokers and Finders_. There is no investment banker, financial advisor,
broker or finder retained by or authorized to act on behalf of Parent, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of Parents shareholders

 



     

 

 



 

or Affiliates who might be entitled to any fee or commission from Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

4.5 _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. All of the outstanding share capital or other equity interests of
Merger Sub are owned directly or indirectly by Parent. There are no options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments to which
Merger Sub is a party relating to the issued or unissued share capital or
other equity interests in Merger Sub or obligating Merger Sub to grant, issue
or sell any shares, or other equity interests in Merger Sub, by sale or
otherwise. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Merger Sub to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Merger Sub. Except for
obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation or
organization and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Merger Sub
has not and will not have incurred, directly or indirectly, through any
Affiliate, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business
activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or
arrangements with any person.

 



 

4.6 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on Section 4.6 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedules, (a) none of Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of their material
assets is subject to any outstanding or unsatisfied Order, (b) there is no
litigation of, before or in any, Governmental Authority, court or quasi-
judicial or administrative agency or official of any federal, state, local or
foreign jurisdiction, arbitrator or mediator, pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened against or affecting any of Parent, its Subsidiaries or
their material assets, (c) there are no settlements or similar written
agreements with any Governmental Authority affecting any of Parent, its
Subsidiaries or their material assets, and (d) as of the date hereof, there is
no litigation involving Parent, its Subsidiaries or their material assets,
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, that, in each case,
questions or challenges (i) the validity of this Agreement, or (ii) any action
taken or to be taken by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

4.7 _Debt Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent is a party to and accepted a fully executed commitment letter dated
May 28, 2019 (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ ") from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the "
_Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein. The debt financing committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter
is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_."

 



 

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of
the executed Debt Commitment Letter and any fee letters related thereto,
subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee and other
economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with
transactions of this type and that could not in any event affect the
availability, conditionality, enforceability or amount of the Debt Financing.

 



 

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the Debt
Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the
total amount of the Debt Financing, including any condition or other
contingency relating to the amount or availability of the Debt Financing
pursuant to any "flex" provision. Parent does not have any reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions
to be satisfied by it in the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing
Date, nor does Parent have knowledge that any of the Lenders will not perform
its obligations thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or

 



     

 

 



 

arrangements of any kind relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that could
affect the availability, enforceability, conditionality or amount of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(d) The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter, will provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under
this Agreement and under the Debt Commitment Letter, including the payment of
the Aggregate Estimated Consideration, any payments in respect of equity
compensation obligations to be made in connection with the Merger, payment of
any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company, and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by, or
required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or
the Debt Commitment Letter (such amounts, collectively, the " _Merger Amounts_
").

 



 

(e) The Debt Commitment Letter constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent, on the one hand, and to the Knowledge of Parent, each
other party thereto, on the other hand, and is in full force and effect. No
event has occurred that (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) could
constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent under the
terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, and Parent does not have
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will
not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis or that the Debt Financing will
not be available to Parent on the date of the Closing. Parent has paid in full
any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement,
and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. The
Debt Commitment Letter has not been modified, amended or altered and none of
the respective commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter has been withdrawn
or rescinded in any respect, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or
rescission thereof is contemplated. No modification or amendment to the Debt
Commitment Letter is currently contemplated.

 



 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations
under this Agreement. Parent will have available on the Closing Date funds
sufficient for the payment by Parent of all Merger Amounts.

 



 

4.8 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Assuming (i) all of
the representations and warranties of the Company herein are true, correct and
complete in all material respects, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ , and (iii) the Financial Statements fairly
present the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods
covered thereby, immediately following the Closing, (a) the present fair
saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) and the fair value of the
assets of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and their respective
Subsidiaries will be greater than the total amount of their probable
liabilities (including a reasonable estimate of the probable amount of all
contingent liabilities), (b) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and
their respective Subsidiaries will be able to pay their respective debts and
obligations in the ordinary course of business as they mature and become due,
and (c) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and their respective
Subsidiaries will not have, or have access to, unreasonably small capital to
carry on their respective businesses and the businesses in which they are
about to engage.

 



      

 

 



 

4.9 _Acquisition for Investment_. Parent is acquiring the shares of the
Surviving Company for investment and not with a view toward or for sale in
connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of
distributing or selling the shares of the Surviving Company. Parent is an
"accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under
the Securities Act. Parent understands and agrees that the shares of the
Surviving Company may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
available thereunder, and without compliance with state, local and foreign
securities Laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.

 



 

4.10 _Non-Reliance_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of themselves
and the other Parent Related Parties, acknowledges and agrees that they have
not relied on any representations or warranties except for the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_ (as modified by the
Company Disclosure Schedules) or in an executed Letter of Transmittal, and
neither the Company nor any other Company Related Party or any other person
has made or is making, and Parent and Merger Sub have not relied upon and is
not relying upon, any other representations or warranties of any nature, oral
or written, past, present or future, including any other representations or
warranties, express or implied. In furtherance of the foregoing, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other Parent Related Party has relied upon or is
relying upon the accuracy or completeness of any other information, made by,
or made available by, the Company or any other Company Related Party, with
respect to, or in connection with, the negotiation, execution or delivery of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the
delivery or disclosure of any documentation or other information with respect
to any one or more of the foregoing, including in certain "data rooms,"
management presentations or other information provided or made available to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Party in anticipation or
contemplation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, in
connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company and its
business and operations by and on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub, Parent,
Merger Sub and other Parent Related Parties have received and may continue to
receive from the Company and other Company Related Parties certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its business and
operations and Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of themselves and the other
Parent Related Parties, hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the Company
or any other Company Related Party, has made or is making any representation
or warranty with respect to, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Parent Related Party has relied upon, such estimates, projections, forecasts,
forward-looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking statements or business plans). Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on
behalf of themselves and the other Parent Related Parties, hereby acknowledges
and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, with which each of Parent and Merger Sub is
familiar, that each of Parent and Merger Sub is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans), and that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Parent Related Party will have any claim against the Company or any other
Company Related Party with respect thereto.

 



 

4.11 _No Additional Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _Article IV_ (as qualified by the Parent
Disclosure Schedules), neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other Person
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Parent or Merger Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Parent and Merger Sub disclaims
any other representations or warranties, whether made by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or
other Representatives. Except for the representations and warranties contained
in this _Article IV_ (as qualified

 



     

 

 



 

by the Parent Disclosure Schedules), each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have
no, and hereby disclaims all, liability and responsibility for any
representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement or information made,
communicated or furnished to the Company or its Affiliates or Representatives
(including any opinion, information, forecast, projection or advice that may
have been or may be provided to the Company or its Affiliates or
Representatives by any director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or other
Representative of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates).

permit reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and records
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and disclosure shall not

result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
their employees of their normal duties or violate any applicable Law;
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company to
provide access or to disclose any information to the other party or its

shall cause DBRS Limited, an Ontario corporation and an indirect Subsidiary of
the Company (the " _Canadian Subsidiary_ "), to deliver to the holder of the
Class A Preferred Shares of the Canadian Subsidiary (the " _Preferred Shares_
") the written notice required by the Organizational Documents of the Canadian
Subsidiary to the effect that the Canadian Subsidiary will effect, on the
Closing Date immediately prior and subject to the Closing, a mandatory
redemption of all of the Preferred Shares, and that such

 



     

 

 



 

mandatory redemption is contingent and conditional upon completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such notice, the " _Redemption
Notice_ ").

 



 

(b) Upon presentation and surrender by the holder of the Preferred Shares of
certificates representing the Preferred Shares to be redeemed, on the Closing
Date immediately prior and subject to the Closing, the Company shall cause the
Canadian Subsidiary to satisfy the redemption of the Preferred Shares for the
applicable value determined pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the
Canadian Subsidiary (the " _Preferred Share Redemption Value_ ") by delivery
to such holder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, of an amount
equal to the Preferred Share Redemption Value less any Tax required to be
deducted and withheld therefrom in accordance with the Organizational
Documents of the Canadian Subsidiary and applicable Law (such redemption, the
" _Preferred Share Redemption_ ").

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 5.6(b)_, if (i) the holder of the Preferred
Shares validly exercises, no later than the second (2nd) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date, the put right in respect of the Preferred Shares
contemplated by the Organizational Documents of the Canadian Subsidiary (the "

or cause to be delivered to such holder (or any other Persons properly
designated by such holder) the Preferred Share Redemption Value in cash by

Share Purchase_ ") and (y) neither the Company nor the Canadian Subsidiary
shall have any obligation to complete the Preferred Share Redemption.

 



 

(d) The obligation of the Company under this _Section 5.6_ to cause the
Preferred Share Redemption Value to be paid in connection with the Preferred
Share Redemption or the Preferred Share Purchase (as applicable) shall be
deemed to be satisfied upon the Company directing Parent to pay (on behalf of
the Canadian Subsidiary or the Put Right Purchaser (as applicable)) to the
holder of the Canadian Preferred Shares the Preferred Share Redemption Value
on the Closing Date immediately prior to the Closing (and Parent shall make
such payment on the Closing Date immediately prior to the Closing upon the
direction of the Company).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding this _Section 5.6_, the Company shall have no obligation
to cause the Canadian Subsidiary or the Put Right Purchaser to deliver the
Redemption Notice or to effect the Preferred Share Redemption or the Preferred
Share Purchase if all of the Preferred Shares are otherwise redeemed or
repurchased prior to the Closing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including in connection with any optional redemption by the Canadian
Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of its Organizational Documents).

 



 

(f) Upon the exercise of the Put Right, at the election of Parent no later
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to organize and form a new Canadian company, which
shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Put Right Purchaser (the " _Canadian
Newco_ ") and shall designate the Canadian Newco as the Put Right Purchaser
and the Canadian Newco shall be the Put Right Purchaser for all purposes
hereunder. The parties hereto agree that any third-party fees and expenses
incurred by the Company with respect to the organization and formation of the
Canadian Newco shall be reimbursed by Parent at the earlier of the Closing or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with true and correct invoices
setting forth the third-party fees and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection therewith. For purposes of _Article III_, the Canadian Newco shall
not be deemed to be a Subsidiary of the Company (whether directly or
indirectly).

 



     

 

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.6_ to the contrary, no
payment of the Preferred Share Redemption Value shall be made by the Canadian
Subsidiary, the Put Right Purchaser or any Person on behalf thereof unless and

release fully executed by the holder of Preferred Shares, AAA UK Holding Co.

Parent shall provide each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
and continues to be actively employed after the Effective Time (any such
employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i) at least the same annual base
salary or wage rate in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing and at
least the same annual cash bonus opportunities provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs
and (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable than those employee
benefits provided to such employees as of the date hereof. Parent shall
provide any Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during the one-
year period following the Closing severance benefits at least equal to the
severance benefits provided to similarly situated employees under the
severance arrangements of Parent and its Affiliates, without taking into
account any reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to such
Continuing Employee.

 



 

(b) _Recognition of Service; Pre-existing Conditions_. Periods of employment
with the Company or any of its current or former Affiliates (and any
predecessors of the foregoing), to the extent previously recognized under any
analogous Benefit Plan of the Company and its Affiliates, shall be taken into
account for purposes of eligibility, participation, level of benefits and
vesting under the corresponding employee benefit plan offered by Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its Affiliates
shall not be required to take into account such service (i) to the extent such
credit would result in duplication of benefits, (ii) for any purpose under any
retiree medical plan, any pension plan or any sabbatical plan or (iii) for
purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (A) under which similarly-
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation. Additionally, Parent shall (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive any waiting period, actively-at-work
requirement or limitation on coverage of the Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents due to preexisting conditions under all applicable welfare
plans of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to the extent such condition was
satisfied or waived under the comparable Benefit Plan prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) credit all Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
with all payments credited against out-of-pocket maximums and deductible
payments and co-payments paid by such Person, in each case, under the
comparable Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date during the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to
which any such Person has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or
she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any corresponding employee
benefit plan offered by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent for such year.

 



 

(c) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan
or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating
any employee benefit plan or from terminating the employment of any Continuing
Employee. The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ are solely for the benefit of
the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 5.7_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Continuing Employee, or legal
representative or beneficiary thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies,
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under
this Agreement or a right of any employee or beneficiary of such employee or
other Person under an employee benefit plan that such

 



     

 

 



 

employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under the
terms of that employee benefit plan without regard to this Agreement.

 



 

5.8 _Section 280G_. If necessary to render Section 280G and Section 4999 of
the Code inapplicable to amounts payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek approval by the shareholders,
in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of the right of any
"disqualified individual" to receive or retain any payments that would, in the
absence of such shareholder approval, constitute "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Prior to seeking such
approvals, the Company shall seek, and use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain waivers from the intended recipients of such payments such that
unless such payments are approved by the shareholders to the extent and in the
manner prescribed under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code, the intended recipients shall have no right or entitlement with respect
thereto. The Company shall provide to Parent, no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to obtaining the waivers (i) drafts of any waivers, disclosure
documents and other relevant documents relating to the waiver and vote
prepared by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this _Section 5.8_
and (ii) a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for its
determination of the payments and benefits that it proposing to have waived
and disclosed to comply with this _Section 5.8_. The Company shall
incorporate any reasonable comments made by Parent prior to obtaining the
waivers and soliciting the shareholder vote.

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present employees, agents, officers and directors of the Company and of its
Subsidiaries to the same extent such Persons are currently indemnified by the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Companys and its Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and for such period of time
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Company or its
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of present and former officers and directors as
in effect in the Surviving Companys Organizational Documents immediately
prior to the Effective Time or with respect to any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Company, as in effect in such Subsidiaries Organizational Documents
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case, except as required by
applicable Law and (ii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to honor any
indemnification agreements in effect between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any past or present employees, agents, officers or directors
of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof and
disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof. If the Surviving Company or any
of its successors or assigns shall: (x) consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (y) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at the
Companys request, Parent shall, prior to or at the Effective Time, purchase
six (6) years run-off directors and officers liability insurance that is
dedicated to the Company and its Subsidiaries and not shared with any other
entity that is unrelated to the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Runoff D andO
Insurance_") on terms not less favorable than those of the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage; _provided_ , in
satisfying its obligation to purchase such Runoff DandO Insurance, Parent shall
not be obligated to pay an annual premium in excess of 300% of the Companys
current annual premium for

 



     

 

 



 

such insurance; _provided further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. Any such Runoff DandO Insurance policies will satisfy Parents
obligation under this _Section 5.9_ to provide directors and officers
liability insurance.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the past and present officers and directors of the
Company and of its Subsidiaries and their respective heirs and legal
representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the other
rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which such a Person is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law,
contract or otherwise.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Company nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or Representatives or any
past and present employees, agents, officers and directors of the Company and
of its Subsidiaries will have any rights or claims against any Lender (or any
of its or their Affiliates or former, current or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, managements, members, directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives) in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Debt Financing, whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Lenders shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9(e)_ and this
_Section 5.9(e)_ cannot be amended in a manner adverse to any Lender without
the prior written consent of such Lender.

unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent, the Company shall terminate
all Affiliate Agreements with no further liability or obligations owed by the

Company shall adopt resolutions to provide (i) for the treatment of Equity

directors, employees, attorneys, accountants and other Representatives to use
its and their commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation as
may reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with Parents arrangement

Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit or cause the taking of any
action pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ that: (A) require the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Persons who are officers or directors of the Company or

incur or assume any liability or obligation, in connection with such Debt

Subsidiaries, (H) involves preparing or providing to the Parent or the Lenders
any financial statements or information that are not available to the Company

be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing..

 



 

(c) Parent shall (i) upon any request by the Company from time to time,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs

cooperation under this _Section 5.14_ or the arrangement of Debt Financing

use in connection with the Debt Financing), except to the extent such

 



     

 

 



 

claim, loss, damage, injury, liability, judgment, award, penalty, fine, cost,
expense, settlement or other loss arises out of or results from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Sponsor Investor, the Company or the
Companys Subsidiaries in fulfilling their obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.14_. Subject to Parents indemnification obligations under this
_Section 5.14_, the Company hereby consents to the use of all of the

initial syndication or marketing of the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such

provisions contained in this _Section 5.14_ represent the sole obligation of
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives
with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this

Time (except to the extent such representations and warranties are made as of

failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

TERMINATION

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to
the Closing Date, whether before or after the Shareholder Approval has been
received:

 



 

(a) With the mutual written consent of each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub;

 



     

 

 



 

(b) By either the Company or Parent, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before September 30, 2019 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, on the Termination Date, any of the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.3_ or, if the failure of such conditions to be satisfied
relates to any antitrust or competition Law in respect of any Required
Regulatory Approval, _Section 6.4_, are the only conditions in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing) that have not been satisfied or waived, then at the written election
of the Company or Parent (to be exercised by written notice to Parent or the
Company, as applicable, at least three (3) calendar days before the
Termination Date), the Termination Date may be extended one time by a period
of up to ninety (90) calendar days (and in the case of such extension, any
reference to the Termination Date in any other provision of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be a reference to the Termination Date as extended);

 



 

(c) By the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise, if
occurring or continuing at the Effective Time, to the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ and (ii) has not been or is
incapable of being cured by Parent prior to the earlier of the (A) Termination
Date and (B) thirtieth (30th) calendar day after its receipt of written notice
thereof from the Company;

 



 

(d) By Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise, if
occurring or continuing at the Effective Time, to the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ and (ii) has not been or is
incapable of being cured by the Company prior to the earlier of the (A)
Termination Date and (B) thirtieth (30th) calendar day after its receipt of
written notice thereof from Parent;

 



 

(e) By either the Company or Parent, if (i) there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the Merger illegal or (ii) any Governmental Authority having
competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, and
such Order or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

 



 

(f) By the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
have been satisfied and continue to be satisfied (other than those that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions were capable
of being satisfied if the Closing had occurred at the time of such
termination), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on or
prior to the date the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_, (iii) the Company thereafter has irrevocably confirmed by written
notice to Parent that all conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been
satisfied (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, which conditions were capable of being satisfied if the Closing had
occurred at the time of such termination) or that it would be willing to waive
any unsatisfied conditions in _Article VII_ (to the extent permitted by Law),
and that the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing on
the date of such confirmation and throughout the three (3) Business Day period
following the delivery of such confirmation, and (iv) Parent and Merger Sub
fail to consummate the Merger within three (3) Business Days following the
delivery of such confirmation.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1_ shall not be available to
any party whose breach of its representations or warranties set forth herein
or whose failure to fulfill its obligations or to comply with its covenants
under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure to
satisfy any condition to the obligations of the other party hereunder. Any
proper termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ shall be
effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating
party to the other parties.

 



     

 

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or
obligation on the part of any party hereto or its respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, members or other
Representatives, other than pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.22_
(Public Announcements), this _Section 8.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Article
IX_ (Shareholder Representative) and _Article X_ (Miscellaneous) (which
Sections and Articles shall survive any termination of this Agreement);
_provided_ that, no such termination of this Agreement shall relieve or
otherwise affect the liability of any party hereto for any fraud or a willful
breach of this Agreement by such party prior to such termination.

 



 

ARTICLE IX

 



 

SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

 



 

9.1 _Designation and Replacement of Shareholder Representative_. The holders
of the Ordinary Shares, Options, Incentive Shares and Restricted Stock Units
(collectively, the " _Equityholders_ ") have agreed that it is desirable to
designate the Shareholder Representative as the "Shareholder Representative"
to act on behalf of the Equityholders for certain limited purposes, as
specified herein. The Shareholder Approval shall constitute ratification and
approval of such designation and by the execution of the Voting and Support
Agreement and/or a Letter of Transmittal, and by receiving the benefits
hereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection
with the Merger, each Equityholder shall be deemed to irrevocably agree to
such appointment and that the Shareholder Representative shall act as a
representative for the benefit of each Equityholder, as the exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact with the power and authority to act on behalf of each
Equityholder for all purposes in connection with and to facilitate the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any agreements
ancillary hereto, which shall include the power and authority set forth in
_Section 9.2_. If the Shareholder Representative shall resign, dissolve,
cease to exist or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as
representative of the Equityholders, the Sponsor Investors shall, within ten
(10) days after the occurrence of such event, appoint a successor
representative who shall execute a joinder to this Agreement as the
Shareholder Representative hereto and, promptly thereafter, shall notify the
Equityholders of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall
succeed to the rights and obligations of the Shareholder Representative as
representative of the Equityholders hereunder and shall be deemed the
"Shareholder Representative" for all purposes hereunder. The grant of
authority by the Equityholders to the Shareholder Representative in this
_Article IX_ is and shall be coupled with an interest, and, except as set
forth in this _Article IX_, such designation is irrevocable and shall not be
affected by the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or other
inability to act of any of the Equityholders and shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the Closing.

 



 

9.2 _Authority and Rights of Shareholder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_.

 



 

(a) The Shareholder Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it in connection with this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Shareholder Representative shall have no obligation to the Equityholders
to act, except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, by the execution of the Voting and Support Agreement and/or
a Letter of Transmittal each Equityholder irrevocably shall agree that the
Shareholder Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion on
behalf of the Equityholders to:

 



 

(i) execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
ancillary hereto as the

 



     

 

 



 

Shareholder Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or
desirable, including any amendments or modifications to this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Equityholders and to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Shareholder Representative
arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or the
transactions provided for herein, and to take any and all actions which the
Shareholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under this
Agreement for and on behalf of each Equityholder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative may on behalf of
the Equityholders: (A) assert any claim or institute any action, proceeding or
investigation; (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any claim, action,
proceeding or investigation initiated by Parent or any other Person, or by any
Governmental Authority against the Shareholder Representative and/or any of
the Equityholders; (C) receive process on behalf of any or all of the
Equityholders in any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and
compromise or settle on such terms as it shall determine to be appropriate,
and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any such claim,
action, proceeding or investigation; (D) file any proofs of debt, claims and
petitions as it may deem advisable or necessary; and (E) file and prosecute
appeals from any decision, judgment or award rendered in any such action,
proceeding or investigation (it being understood that the Shareholder
Representative shall not have any obligation to the Equityholders to take any
such actions, and shall not have any Liability to the Equityholders for any
failure to take any such actions);

 



 

(iii) refrain from enforcing any right of the Equityholders and/or the
Shareholder Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of the Shareholder
Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be
deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Shareholder
Representative or by the Equityholders unless such waiver is in writing signed
by the Shareholder Representative;

 



 

(iv) make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action, in each case on behalf of
the Equityholders, that the Shareholder Representative, in its sole and
absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in
connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto;

 



 

(v) determine whether to deliver a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement and to
resolve any disputes regarding the Closing Statement and take any actions in
connection therewith contemplated by _Section 2.9(g)_ and _Section 2.10_ of
this Agreement;

 



 

(vi) make any payments or pay any expenses under or in connection with this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under _Article II_ hereof
and the payment of the Deficiency Amount from the Purchase Price Adjustment
Holdback Amount) or on behalf of the Equityholders, including by using any
remaining portion of the Shareholder Representative Expense Amount to satisfy
costs, expenses and/or Liabilities of the Shareholder Representative in
connection with matters related to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto, with any balance of the Shareholder Representative Expense Amount not
used for such purposes to be disbursed and paid, at such time as the
Shareholder Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that no
additional such costs, expenses and/or Liabilities shall become due and
payable, to the Equityholders in accordance with _Section 9.2(c)_.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) All actions taken by the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement
shall be binding upon the Equityholders and their respective successors and
assigns as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them.
Each Equityholder, by execution of the Voting and Support Agreement and/or a
Letter of Transmittal, shall agree that any action taken by the Shareholder
Representative on its behalf pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be fully binding on them.

 



 

(c) The Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Shareholder Representative Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Shareholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Shareholder Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Shareholder Representative
Expense Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Shareholder Representative will hold these funds separate from
its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or
any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the completion of the Shareholder Representatives responsibilities,
the Shareholder Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the
Shareholder Representative Expense Amount to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Equityholders pursuant to _Section 2.9_ in accordance
with a Post-Closing Payments Schedule prepared by the Shareholders
Representative. For tax purposes, the Shareholder Representative Expense
Amount will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Equityholders at the time of Closing.

 



 

(d) The Shareholder Representative will incur no liability of any kind with
respect to any action or omission by the Shareholder Representative in
connection with the Shareholder Representatives services pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the Shareholder Representatives gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholder Representative shall not be
liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Equityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholder
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Shareholder Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Shareholder Representative, the
Shareholder Representative will reimburse the Equityholders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Shareholder
Representative by the Equityholders, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Shareholder Representative from (i) the funds in the
Shareholder Representative Expense Amount, and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow
Account at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to
the Equityholders; _provided_ , that while this section allows the Shareholder
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Shareholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Shareholder Representative be required
to advance its own funds on behalf of the Equityholders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of the
Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Shareholder Representative under
this _Section 9.2(d)_ and (ii) the aggregate liability of any Equityholder to
the Shareholder Representative shall not exceed the Applicable Equityholder
Consideration actually

 



     

 

 



 

received by such Equityholder. The foregoing indemnities will survive the
Closing, the resignation or removal of the Shareholder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

9.3 _Representations and Warranties of the Shareholder Representative_. The
Shareholder Representative represents and warrants to Parent and the Merger
Sub as follows:

 



 

(a) It is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization. It has all requisite limited
liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and the performance by
it of its obligations under this Agreement do not (i) to the knowledge of the
Shareholder Representative, upon commercially reasonable inquiry, conflict
with or violate applicable Laws or (ii) conflict with or violate any provision
of, or require the consent or approval of any Person (except for any such
consents or approvals which have been obtained) under, its Organizational
Documents or any contract or agreement to which it is a party.

 



 

(c) The execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and the performance by
it of its obligations under this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or other analogous action on its part. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder Representative
and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder
Representative enforceable against the Shareholder Representative in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and the laws of agency.

otherwise requires. Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include the plural, and any plural term in this Agreement the singular.
"Writing," "written" and comparable terms refer to printing, typing and other
means of reproducing words (including electronic format) in a visible form. If
any action under this Agreement is required to be done or taken on a day that
is not a Business Day, then such action shall be required to be done or taken
not on such day but on the first succeeding Business Day thereafter. The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit, the
Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning given to such term in this
Agreement. References from or through any date shall mean, unless otherwise
specified, from and including or through and including, respectively. All
references to dollars or to "$" shall be references to United States dollars
unless otherwise specified. The conversion of values from any other currency
to United States dollars shall be effected based upon the Applicable Spot
Rate. Any U.S. legal term for any action, remedy, legal document, legal
status, court, authority, statute or any other legal concept or thing

 



      

 

 



 

shall, in respect of any jurisdiction other than the U.S., be deemed to
include that which most nearly approximates in that jurisdiction to the U.S.
legal term.

 



 

10.7 _Governing Law_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the Laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws
thereof; provided that the Merger and any exercise of dissenter rights with
respect to the Merger which are exercised pursuant to the Companies Law shall
be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding subsection (a) to
the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, claim or legal proceeding of any kind (whether at Law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Lender in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). Such courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over
any action brought against any Lender relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

10.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and that any breach of this Agreement would not be adequately compensated by
monetary damages. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by the Company or the Shareholder Representative,
on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company
or the Shareholder Representative, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
other and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement, and to
thereafter cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated in accordance with its terms. Each party hereto hereby agrees not
to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such
party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 10.8_ on the basis that the party
seeking such remedies has an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any
party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such Order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 10.8_.

 



 

10.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns;
provided that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned (including by operation of law) by any
of the Shareholder Representative, the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Company without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided that
without the consent of the Company or the Shareholder Representative, either
Parent or

 



     

 

 



 

Merger Sub may assign (in whole but not in part) its rights and obligations
under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or to any
financing sources for collateral security purposes, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported
assignment in contravention of this _Section 10.9_ shall be null and void.

 



 

10.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
the parties hereto and, except for _Section 5.9_, _Section 8.2_ and _Article
X_ and except as provided in the succeeding paragraph, no provision of this
Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon third parties, either express or
implied, any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other
right.

 



 

 _Section 5.9(e)_, _Section 5.15_, _Section 8.2_, _Section 10.7(b)_,
_Section 10.10_ and _Section 10.11_ (collectively, the " _Debt Financing
Provisions_ ") shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Lenders to
the extent related to the Lenders.

 



 

10.11 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
or otherwise, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or
causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made against the entities
and Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement in
their capacities as such, and no Lender, and no former, current or future
shareholders, equity holders, controlling Persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, agents or
Affiliates of any party hereto or any Lender, or any former, current or future
direct or indirect shareholder, equity holder, controlling Person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce
this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section
10.11_ shall not have the effect of making _Section 9.2_ inapplicable to an
Equityholder with respect to its appointment, exculpation or indemnification
of the Shareholder Representative.

 



 

10.12 _Release_. Effective upon the Closing, Parent, on its own behalf and on
behalf of the Surviving Company and each of its former, present and future
Subsidiaries (each of the foregoing, a " _Releasing Party_ "), hereby releases
and forever discharges each former, current or future direct or indirect
shareholders, equity holders, controlling Persons and directors of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or any such direct or indirect shareholders, equity
holders or controlling Persons former, current or future shareholders,
equity holders, controlling Persons, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers or Affiliates of the
foregoing (each of the foregoing, a " _Released Party_ ") from any and all
claims, rights, obligations, debts, liabilities, actions or causes of action
of every kind and nature, whether foreseen or unforeseen, contingent or
actual, and whether now known or hereafter discovered, which any of the
Releasing Parties had, now has or may in the future have, at law or in equity,
against any Released Party in any way arising out of, in connection with,
pertaining to or by reason of (a) their respective status as a holder,
directly or indirectly, of equity of the Company or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (b) any acts or omissions, or alleged acts or
omissions, by any of them in their respective capacities as a holder of
equity, directly or indirectly, of the Company or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, which acts or omissions existed or occurred at or
prior to the Closing (each, a " _Released Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Releasing Parties expressly do not release their rights and interests
(i) under this Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreement, the Letters of
Transmittal or the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) with respect to claims,
actions, causes of action or

 



     

 

 



 

any liabilities that arise as a result of Fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or other criminal act by the Released Party, (iii) with respect to any claim
of, or liability to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any successor
thereof) against any Released Party to the extent resulting from the Released
Partys status as an employee or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iv) with respect to any Released Party in his or her capacity
as a director, with respect to any claim, loss, damage, injury, liability,
judgment, award, penalty, fine, cost, expense, settlement or other loss
arising out of or resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty by, or the gross
negligence, the willful misconduct or bad faith of, any such Released Party or
(v) under the contracts and agreements identified on _Section 10.12_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedules. Each of Parent and Merger Sub covenants and
agrees that it will honor such release and will not, and will cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take any action inconsistent
therewith (including commencing any litigation with respect to, or directly or
indirectly transferring to another Person, any Released Claim). This _Section
10.12_ shall survive the Closing, is intended for the benefit of and may be
enforced directly by each of the Released Parties, and shall be binding on all
successors and permitted assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company.

 



 

10.13 _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of Parent or the
Surviving Company, each party will, on and after the Closing Date, execute and
deliver to the other parties such other documents, assignments and other
instruments as may be reasonably required to effectuate the Merger and to
effect and evidence the provisions of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

10.14 _Entire Understanding_. The Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Schedules
and the Parent Disclosure Schedules identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. This Agreement, the
Voting and Support Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement set forth the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior agreements, arrangements
and understandings among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

 



 

10.15 _JURISDICTION OF DISPUTES_. IN THE EVENT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
COMMENCES ANY LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LEGAL ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH
OR RELATING TO NEGOTIATION, EXPLORATION, DUE DILIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO OR
ENTERING INTO OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS DESCRIBED OR CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN, THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY (A) AGREE THAT ANY SUCH
LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LEGAL ACTION SHALL BE INSTITUTED EXCLUSIVELY
IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
WHETHER A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT; (B) AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH
LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION, SUCH PARTIES WILL CONSENT AND SUBMIT TO
PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN ANY SUCH COURT DESCRIBED IN CLAUSE (A) OF THIS
_SECTION 10.15_ AND TO SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
RULES AND STATUTES GOVERNING SERVICE OF PROCESS; (C) AGREE TO WAIVE TO THE
FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE
TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION IN ANY SUCH COURT OR
THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM; (D) AGREE AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF SERVICE TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BY MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF TO SUCH PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS
SET FORTH IN _SECTION 10.3_ FOR COMMUNICATIONS TO SUCH PARTY; (E) AGREE THAT
ANY SERVICE MADE AS PROVIDED HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN
EVERY RESPECT; AND (F) AGREE THAT NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF
ANY PARTY TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW;
_PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH

 



     

 

 



 

IN _SECTION 2.10_ SHALL BE GOVERNED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION
2.10_.

 



 

10.16 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES OF FACT AND LAW, AND THEREFORE, EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
OTHERWISE HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATION, EXPLORATION, DUE
DILIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO OR ENTERING INTO OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER

CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.16_.

 



 

10.17 _Disclosure Schedules_. Disclosure in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules shall apply
only to the indicated Section of this Agreement, except to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to or relevant to another Section of this Agreement. The inclusion
of information in the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure
Schedules shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to any of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. In addition, matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company
Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any
dollar amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure
Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material, and shall not be construed as an admission of
liability or responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or controversy.
Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedules or the
Parent Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such item or matter, or
other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business
(except where expressly stated in the relevant representation, warranty or
covenant), and shall not be construed as an admission of liability or
responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or controversy.

 



 

10.18 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely

 



     

 

 



 

as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

 



 

10.19 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to any federal,
state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise.

 



 

10.20 _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz; Walkers; Stikeman Elliot LLP and Macfarlanes LLP
(collectively, the " _Legal Advisors_ ") may serve as counsel to each and any
Equityholder and its Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "
_Shareholder Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, the Legal Advisors (or any successor)
may serve as counsel to the Shareholder Representative, and each and any
member of the Shareholder Group or any director, partner, officer, employee or
Affiliate of any member of the Shareholder Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such
representation and each of the parties hereto (including the Surviving
Company) hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to
consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation. In
the event of a dispute between Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries and any member of the Shareholder Group (including the
Shareholder Representative on behalf of a member of the Shareholder Group),
Parent and Merger Sub agree that, as to all communications prior to Closing
among any of the Legal Advisors, on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Equityholders and their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, that relate in any way to such dispute, the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Equityholders and
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, and may be controlled by the
Equityholders and their respective Affiliates and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries and a third
party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Surviving
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by the Legal Advisors, the Equityholders and their
respective Affiliates to such third party. This _Section 10.20_ is for the
benefit of the Shareholder Group and such Persons are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 10.20_.

 



 

10.21 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other transaction documents to be
entered into in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, except with respect to
German RETT, any applicable stock transfer or similar Taxes) shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses, except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement.

 



 

10.22 _Public Announcements_. On the date hereof and following the execution
of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall jointly make a press release,
in form mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent, announcing the
execution of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder.
Following the press release referenced above and prior to the Closing, no
party (including any Equityholder), without the prior written approval of the
Company and Parent (which approval shall not be

 



     

 

 



 

unreasonably withheld or delayed), will make any other press release or other
public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except to the extent required by Law (including securities Laws of
any jurisdiction and rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange),
in which case the Company and Parent will be so advised as far in advance as
reasonably practicable and will be given an opportunity to comment on such
release or announcement.
