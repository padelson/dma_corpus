 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations and their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ");

 

 WHEREAS, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Merger and as part of a single integrated transaction, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to be merged with and into a direct wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of Parent (the " _LLC Merger_ " and collectively with the Merger, the " _Mergers_ "), with such subsidiary surviving the LLC Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

 

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, certain holders of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") and the Holder Representative are entering into a Stockholders Agreement with even date hereof (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ ");

 

 WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that the Mergers, taken together, shall be treated as a single integrated transaction and shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

 

 WHEREAS, the parties have priced the transaction to close on July 1, 2010, and accordingly have provided for a contingent adjustment downwards or upwards of $177,352 per day depending on whether the transaction closes before or after such date; and

 

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  

ARTICLE I

Until so surrendered, each such Certificate for shares shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Merger Consideration or Non-Accredited Investor Consideration, as the case may be, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of a Certificate or Certificates that delivers to the Exchange Agent prior to the Closing Date a Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and Investor Questionnaire, shall, subject to Section 2.4, be entitled to receive, on the Closing Date, either from the Exchange Agent or Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds (provided that Exchange Agent and Parent may make payment by check in lieu of wire transfer to any holder entitled to an amount of less than $1,000,000), the Per Share Cash Consideration or the Non-Accredited Investor Consideration, as applicable, for the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration thereof in respect of shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates, and physical delivery to its Representative present at the location of the Closing of a certificate or certificates evidencing the whole number of

   

shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.7, in such denomination and registered in such names as
such holder may request.

 

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

 

 (d) The Exchange Agent and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable in respect of Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and paid to the applicable Tax authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time or with respect to the exercise of Company Equity Awards that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest one one-hundredth, of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (or such other primary stock exchange on which the Parent Common Stock is then listed) as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to

   

the nearest hundredth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Sections 1.5 and 1.7.

 

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company as of the six month anniversary of the Effective Time may, at Parents option, be paid to Parent. In such event, any former stockholders or any former holder of Company Equity Awards who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Non-Accredited Investor Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement or with respect to the Equity Award Consideration, in each case, without any interest thereon. The Exchange Agent will notify Parent prior to the time that any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed would have to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws and, at Parents option, such portion shall be paid to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration or Option Consideration, as the case may be, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 (a) _Indemnification Escrow_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, $35,000,000 of the Cash Consideration (the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") otherwise payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares), Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs (the " _Escrow Participating Holders_ ") will be deducted from the Cash Consideration to be paid to the Escrow Participating Holders ( _pro rata_ in accordance with the

   

Escrow Participating Holders relative Escrow Percentages) and shall be paid
by Parent to an escrow agent to be mutually agreed among the Holder
Representative and Parent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to be held in escrow to

Section 8.5(d). The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be held and invested
by the Escrow Agent in an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") in accordance
with the terms of an escrow agreement to be mutually agreed upon by the Holder
Representative and Parent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Indemnification
Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, which shall specify that (i) the funds
remaining therein (if any) shall be released to the Escrow Participating
Holders on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Survival

shall be released from the Escrow Account unless such release of funds is
authorized by joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent signed by Parent

delivers to the Escrow Agent and the other parties to the Escrow Agreement a
final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction determining
that either Parent or the Holder Representative is entitled to release of such
funds under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Each of Parent and the
Holder Representative agrees to execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint
written instructions providing for release of all or a portion of the Escrow
Amount, and any interest earned thereon, promptly upon any person becoming
entitled to release of such funds under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The " _Escrow Percentage_ " of each Escrow Participating Holder
means a fraction, expressed as a percentage, (x) the numerator of which is the
sum of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company SARs and
Company RSUs held by such Escrow Participating Holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (y) the denominator of which is the Aggregate Fully-
Diluted Company Common Shares _minus_ the Dissenting Shares.

 

 (b) The Escrow Agent and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to holders of Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Escrow Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and paid to the relevant Tax authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 2.5. _[Reserved]_.

related to the Financing, including costs and expenses associated with or
relating to compliance by the Company with Sections 6.5 and 6.6. The aggregate
dollar amount of Company Expenses shall be deducted from the Stock

business day before the Closing Date, the Company will provide to Parent a
true and correct itemized list of the Company Expenses, which list shall
include a description of each expense and the dollar amount of each such
expense. For purposes of this Agreement " _Parent Expenses_ " shall mean (i)
up to $100,000 in the aggregate for transfer Taxes and (ii) if the Closing
occurs, the Transaction Bonus Pool. Parent shall pay all Parent Expenses. "
_Interim Period Interest_ " means, to the extent the 2011 Notes remain
outstanding following the Closing Date, the amount of interest that will
accrue on the 2011 Notes between the Closing Date and the thirtieth (30th) day
following the Closing Date.

 

 (b) On or prior to the fifth business day before the Closing Date, the Holder Representative will provide to Parent a reasonable good faith estimate (which estimate shall include such reserves as the Holder Representative determines in good faith to be Holder Allocable Expenses that are not then known or determinable) of the fees and expenses that have been or may be incurred by the Holder Representative on behalf of the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs (each a " _Holder_ " and collectively, the " _Holders_ ") in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby other than the Company Expenses (the " _Holder Allocable Expenses_ ").

will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date. Parent has paid in full
any and all commitment or other fees required to be paid under the Commitment

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter ( _provided_ that Parent may amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities or otherwise amend the Commitment Letter so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing and the terms are not less beneficial to Parent or the Company with respect to conditionality or amount of funding on the Closing than those in the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to funding of the Financing, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto and (iv) comply with its obligations, and enforcing its rights, under the Commitment Letter. Parent shall provide the Company prompt written notice of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter (or commitments for any alternative financing obtained in accordance with this Section 6.5) of which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Commitment Letter (or commitments for any alternative financing obtained in accordance with this Section 6.5). Parent shall, upon request of the Company from time to time, inform the Company in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or alternative financing obtained in accordance with this Section 6.5). In the event that Parent becomes aware that any portion of the Financing is unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing for such portion from alternative sources. Parent shall not agree to nor permit any amendment, modification or waiver (other than a waiver of a condition to the Financing) of the Commitment Letter, any other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to the Financing or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing that is materially adverse to Parent or the Company without the Companys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,

   

compliance by Parent with this Section 6.5 shall not relieve Parent of its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether or not the Financing is available.

 

 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to provide, at Parents sole cost and expense, (and cause its Representatives to provide) such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement and syndication of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries). Such reasonable cooperation in connection with the Financing shall include, without limitation, (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies; (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda and similar documents required in connection with the Financing, including execution and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with bank information memoranda; (iii) providing reasonable and timely assistance with the preparation of business projections, pro forma financial information and similar information and materials; (iv) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with (A) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, and the notes and schedules thereto, no later than 60 days prior to the Closing Date, (B) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company for any subsequent quarterly period ended no less than 45 days prior to the Closing Date, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the same period of the prior fiscal year, no later than 45 days after the end of the relevant fiscal quarter and (C) all financial information related to the Company reasonably requested by Parent and reasonably necessary for Parent to produce the pro forma financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to the Commitment Letter or any alternative financing; (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to effect the timely delivery of drafts of customary comfort (including "negative assurance" comfort) letters by the auditor of the Company which such auditor is prepared to issue upon completion of customary procedures; (vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent to obtain customary legal opinions, appraisals, surveys, title insurance and other documentation and items relating to real estate collateral under the Financing as reasonably requested by Parent and, if requested by Parent, to cooperate with and assist Parent in obtaining such documentation and items; (vii) providing reasonable and customary management and legal representations to auditors; (viii) executing and delivering, as of the Effective Time, any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents, as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Financing) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral; and (ix) not commencing or effecting any offering, placement or arrangement of any debt securities or bank financing (or permitting any such offering, placement or arrangement by the Company to occur on its behalf); _provided_ that (i) the Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability or other obligation in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing and (ii) no Person that is a director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action in such capacity with respect to the Financing (or any alternative financing) prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall cooperate with Parent, if requested by Parent, to appoint Parents designees to the Board of Directors or similar governing bodies of the

   

Subsidiaries of the Company, as of the Closing Date, for the purpose of taking
corporate action related to the Financing as of the Closing. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent all reasonably available
information relating to the Company reasonably requested by Parent and
reasonably necessary for the preparation of (A) a customary confidential
offering memorandum with respect to the syndication of the credit facilities
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, and (B) a complete customary
preliminary offering memorandum relating to the issuance of the securities
contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and Representatives from and against
any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by any
of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (or any
alternative financing) and the utilization of any information in connection
therewith and all other actions taken by the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.5(b). Parent shall, from time
to time, reimburse the Company for any and all reasonable out-of-pocket
expense incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with its
compliance with this Section 6.5(b), promptly upon receipt of the Companys
written request therefor.

 

 6.6. _Termination of Certain Other Indebtedness_.

The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and take all other actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the termination of commitments under the Company Credit Agreement, the repayment in full of all obligations then outstanding thereunder (using funds provided by Parent) and the release of all liens in connection therewith on the Closing Date (such termination, repayment and release, the " _Credit Agreement Termination_ "); _provided_ , that in no event shall this Section 6.6(a) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cause such Credit Agreement Termination unless the Closing shall have occurred and Parent shall have provided to the Company funds to pay in full the Payoff Amount. Concurrently with the Closing, Parent shall pay to the administrative agent under the Company Credit Agreement all amounts required pursuant to the terms of the Company Credit Agreement and specified in the Payoff Letter to effect the Credit Agreement Termination.

 

 (b) The Company shall, not fewer than 15 days prior to the Closing, comply with Section 3.01 of the indenture (the " _Indenture_ ") governing the Companys 8% Senior Notes due 2011 (the " _2011 Notes_ ") or obtain the agreement of the trustee under the Indenture to waive compliance with Section 3.01 of the Indenture in connection with the

   

Discharge. If requested by the Parent in writing, the Company shall (A)
substantially simultaneously with the Effective Time issue a notice of
optional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
the 2011 Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture, and (B)
substantially simultaneously with the Effective Time, take any other actions
reasonably requested by the Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and
discharge of the 2011 Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge
provisions of the Indenture and the other provisions of the Indenture;
_provided_ that prior to or simultaneously with the Companys being required
to take any of the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above, the Parent
shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the
Indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and
discharge. The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of the 2011 Notes
pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the "
_Discharge_ " of the 2011 Notes. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Discharge of the 2011 Notes identified to the
Company by Parent in writing at any time.

 

 (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to replace all letters of credit that are (i) currently outstanding or issued after the date hereof in compliance with this Agreement and (ii) issued for the account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Letters of Credit_ ") with letters of credit issued and outstanding under Parents credit facility or any credit facility entered into in connection with the Financing, effective as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to obtain cash-collateralized letters of credit pursuant to this Section 6.6(c) except to the extent cash collateral is required under the terms of Parents credit facilities in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. If such replacement of the Company Letters of Credit is not accomplished, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts following the Closing to replace the outstanding Company Letters of Credit with letters of credit issued under the credit facilities of Parent (which efforts shall include payment of all fees in connection with the issuance of such replacement letters of credit under such credit facilities). To the extent that some or all of the cash collateral securing the reimbursement obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Company Letters of Credit is not released on the Closing Date, the Holders will not be entitled to receive the portion of the Cash Consideration equal to the amount of cash that, following the Closing, continues to be held as collateral securing the reimbursement obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the Company Letters of Credit until such amount of cash is so released.

 

 6.7. _Termination of Affiliate Agreements_. At or prior to the Closing, (i) the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, terminate the Contracts between the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Companys stockholders or their affiliates, on the other hand, other than (A) those Contracts listed in Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (B) Contracts between or among the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, on one hand, and one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, on the other hand, and (C) any Company Benefit Plan or any other employment, retention, bonus, severance, consulting, non-disclosure or similar agreement entered into between the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, on one hand, and any current or former officer, director or employee of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in each case, without payment or incurrence of further liability or obligation (contingent or otherwise) thereunder and (ii) the

   

Company will deliver to Parent evidence of the termination of such Contracts
required to be terminated pursuant to this Section 6.7, which evidence shall
be reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 

 6.8. _Employee Matters_. (a) In order to satisfy the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, the Company shall submit to a vote of the stockholders of the Company for their approval of all payments or benefits that in the absence of such approval could reasonably be expected to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), to any individuals that are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder). The form of such stockholder vote and all disclosure to stockholders regarding the facts regarding the vote, shall be subject to the prior approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, denied, conditioned, or delayed). In addition, to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, the Company shall have received an irrevocable written waiver, in the form attached as Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from each such disqualified individual of all payments or benefits payable to such disqualified individuals that in the absence of such approval would constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder) (assuming that no portion of any payment to be received by such disqualified individuals would be viewed as "reasonable compensation for personal services" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder).

 

 (b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, effectuate the matters set forth on Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Transaction Bonus Pool_ ") in the manner described therein.

 

 (c) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain for employees employed in the United States who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and who continue in the employ of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (" _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) a base salary or wages that are no less favorable than, (ii) a variable/incentive/bonus opportunity that provides a substantially similar variable/incentive/bonus opportunity (excluding any value attributable to equity and equity-based compensation) to, and (iii) other benefit plans and arrangements (except with respect to employer matching contributions under any defined contribution plan, which shall be provided at a level consistent with the terms of the plan applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate with respect to each such Continuing Employee to, in each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing; it being understood that at Parents election the foregoing may be satisfied through participation in (i) the Company Benefit Plans, (ii) the plans of Parent, the Surviving Company or their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Company Benefit Plans) or (iii) any combination of such plans (each a " _Surviving Company Plan_ ") and that participation in any Surviving Corporation Plan may commence or cease (as applicable) at different times. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any employee, provided that any such termination is effected in accordance with applicable law.

   

 (d) From and after the Closing Date, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accrual under any Surviving Company Plan in which a Continuing Employees is eligible to participate, Parent shall recognize or cause to be recognized each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such service need not be recognized (i) to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (ii) for purposes of any frozen plan or grandfathered benefits or (iii) for benefit accrual purposes under any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries that is a defined benefit pension plan.

 

 (e) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive or cause to be waived for each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) give or cause to be given full credit under the welfare plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries that provide medical benefits and are applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single continuous employer.

 

 (f) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.10, the provisions of this Section 6.8 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan, Surviving Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or agreement for any purpose or limit the right of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, Surviving Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or agreement.

 

 6.9. _Subsequent Financial Statements_. The Company shall provide to Parent a copy of the Companys financial results for any month ending after the date of this Agreement in the same format no later than one day following the date such financial results are provided to TC Group, LLC or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries). In addition, the Company shall provide a copy of the Companys financial results for any period ending after the date of this Agreement prior to making publicly available its financial results for any such period and shall provide to Parent a copy of all Company SEC Reports prior to filing them.

 

 6.10. _Non-Solicitation of Alternative Transactions_.

   

 (a) Unless and until this Agreement will have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, directly, indirectly or through their officers, shareholders, directors, employees, affiliates, and their respective financial advisors, consultants, attorneys and other agents and representatives (" _Representatives_ "), engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any confidential information or data to or access to the books, records, assets, business or personnel of the Company, or solicit, encourage, or respond to any proposals or inquiries from, or enter into any agreements with any third party (or authorize or consent to any of the foregoing actions) relating to (A) any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all assets of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (B) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (C) any direct or indirect acquisition of beneficial ownership of 5 percent or more of the equity securities of the Company, other than, in each case, with Parent or its affiliates.

 

 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, immediately terminate and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and its affiliates) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing actions described in Section 6.10(a). The Company shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, enforce their respective rights under, and shall not release any third party from, the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company or its affiliates is a party with respect to a potential sale of capital stock of, or merger, consolidation, combination, sale of assets, reorganization or similar transaction involving the Company or its Subsidiaries and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any such third party to make any proposal regarding the foregoing.

 

 (c) Unless and until this Agreement will have been terminated in accordance with its terms, Parent shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, directly, indirectly or through their Representatives, (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any confidential information or data to or access to the books, records, assets, business or personnel of Parent, or solicit, encourage, or respond to any proposals or inquiries (any such proposal or inquiry, an " _Alternative Transaction Proposal_ ") from any third party relating to (A) any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (B) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; or (C) any direct or indirect acquisition of beneficial ownership of 30% or more of the equity securities of Parent, other than, in each case, with the Company or its affiliates (an " _Alternative Transaction_ ") or (ii) enter into any agreements with any third party (or authorize or consent to any of the foregoing actions) with respect to any Alternative Transaction other than with the Company or its affiliates.

 

 (d) Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, immediately terminate and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than the Company and its affiliates) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing actions described in Section 6.10(c). Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, enforce their respective rights under, and shall not release any third party from, the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which Parent or its affiliates is a party with respect to any Alternative Transaction and shall immediately take all steps necessary

   

to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such
provisions authorizing any such third party to make any Alternative
Transaction Proposal.

 

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the requisite affirmative vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock, Parent may, in response to a _bona fide_ written Alternative Transaction Proposal from a person other than the Company or its affiliates if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, (i) furnish information with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Alternative Transaction Proposal and its Representatives (provided that such information was previously provided to the Company or is simultaneously provided to the Company) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive than the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) participate in discussions concerning the terms of such Alternative Transaction Proposal and negotiate the terms with the person making such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

 

 6.11. _FIRPTA Certificate_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent an affidavit, dated as of the Closing Date, signed under penalty of perjury, and in form and substance required under the Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section 1445(b)(3) and Section 897 of the Code.

 

 6.12. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

 (a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to continue to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any actions, suits, claims or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under their respective charter or by-laws or comparable organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement subject to limitations imposed by applicable law to indemnify such person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law); _provided_ , the person to whom such expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to the Surviving Company to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification; _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable law and the charter and by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Holder Representative and the Surviving Company.

 

 (b) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have been heretofore delivered to

   

Parent) either through continuation of the current policy or substitution by
Parent of another policy therefor on terms not materially less favorable than
the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events which occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim is asserted or made within
such six-year period, such insurance shall be continued in respect of such
claim until the final disposition thereof; and _provided further_ , _however_
, that in complying with its obligations pursuant to the terms of this Section
6.12(b), Parent shall not be required to expend annually in the aggregate an
amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
(which current amount is set forth on Section 6.12 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Premium Cap_ ")) and if Parent cannot obtain such insurance
coverage without paying in excess of the Premium Cap, Parent shall purchase
such insurance with the maximum coverage available for the Premium Cap;
_provided further_ , _however_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, Parent may direct the Company to purchase a six-year prepaid "tail
policy" that provides coverage no less favorable than the coverage described
above; _provided further, however_ that if the annual premiums for such "tail"
policy exceeds the Premium Cap, then Parent may direct the Company to obtain a
"tail" policy with the maximum coverage available for the Premium Cap applied
over the term of such policy.

 

 6.13. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 6.14. _Reorganization_. Parent and the Company intend that the Mergers together shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Provided that the Company receives an opinion of Latham and Watkins LLP dated as of the Closing Date to the effect that for federal income tax purposes, the Mergers together will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (and such opinion has not been withdrawn), each party will report the Mergers as such for federal, state and local income tax purposes except as otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, or by similar provision of applicable state or local income, franchise or other relevant Tax law. Neither Parent nor the Company will take any action or fail to take any action, which action or failure to act would cause the Mergers to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company shall elect to apply the provisions of the proposed United States Treasury Regulations (REG-146247-06, 2007-1 C.B. 977) in the Federal Register (72 FR 13058) concerning fixed price contracts to the Mergers taken together, as permitted under Internal Revenue Service Notice 2010-25, 2010-14 IRB, and Parent shall cause its affiliates (including but not limited to the Surviving Company) to so elect as may be necessary under the terms of the Notice to ensure the proposed regulations apply to the Mergers. Parent and its affiliates, as applicable, and the Company shall not adopt a treatment of such Mergers that is inconsistent with such elections.

 

 6.15. _Tax Matters_.

 

 (a) Parent shall cause to be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices (except where otherwise required by applicable law) all Tax Returns of the Company

   

and its Subsidiaries for all taxable years or periods ending on or before the
Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Tax Returns_ ") and for any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (" _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ "). Parent shall
cause each Pre-Closing Tax Return and Straddle Period Tax Return to be
delivered to the Holder Representative for its review and consultation with
Parent a reasonable period of time prior to the due date for such Tax Return
(taking into account any applicable extensions of time to file). Parent shall
consider in good faith any written comments to such Tax Return received from
the Holder Representative. Parent shall cause the Company to timely file all
such Pre-Closing Tax Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns.

 

 (b) Except as provided in Section 6.15(c) hereof, Parent and the Holder Representative shall cooperate fully, and Parent shall cause its affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any action regarding Taxes of, or with respect to, the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such action and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent shall (i) retain or cause to be retained all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until 120 days after the expiration of the statute of limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof, which extensions Parent shall notify the Holder Representative of promptly in writing) of the respective taxable periods and (ii) give the Holder Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the Holder Representative so requests, shall allow the Holder Representative to take possession of such books and records.

 

 (c) Parent covenants that it will not cause or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries or any affiliates of Parent to (i) take any action on the Closing Date after the Closing outside of the ordinary course of business or (ii) except as otherwise required pursuant to an audit, examination or other adjustment required by a Tax authority, amend any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, make or amend any material Tax election or take any action that results in increased taxable income or gain or the reduction of any Tax asset of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any Current Tax Period); provided for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this subsection (c) shall permit Parent or any of its affiliates to take any action with respect to a Current Tax Period that is inconsistent with its obligations under this Section 6.15 with respect to any Current Tax Period.

 

 (d) The parties shall treat the taxable year of the Company and its Subsidiaries as ending on the Closing Date where required or allowable by law and, except as provided under the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76, shall allocate income to the period ending on the Closing Date based on a closing of the books as of the Closing Date. The parties hereto agree that no ratable allocation election under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any other similar law shall be made with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76 and any analogous law, any income or gain related to any extraordinary transaction

   

that occurs on the Closing Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto agree pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii) that the Tax deductions arising out of
the payment of the Option Consideration, the SAR Consideration and the RSU
Consideration shall be allocated to and reported in the taxable year of the
Company ending on the Closing Date, except as otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, or by
similar provision of applicable state or local income, franchise or other
relevant Tax law.

 8.1. _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement or in the certificates delivered pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.2(c) and Section 7.3(c) (the " _Closing Certificates_ ") shall survive the Closing until the Survival Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any covenants to be performed after the Closing Date shall survive until such covenant is fully performed. The representations and warranties set forth in the certificate delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 7.2(c) shall not survive the Closing. No claim for indemnification may be asserted pursuant to Section 8.2 after the Survival Termination Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any claim made in good faith for breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this Section 8.1 if written notice of such claim (setting forth the basis therefor in reasonable detail) shall have been given to the party against whom such

   

indemnity may be sought prior to such time, and such claim is pursued in good
faith hereunder within a reasonable time period thereafter.

 

 8.2. _Indemnification_.

 

 (a) Effective at and after the Closing, Parent and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to indemnification solely from the Indemnification Escrow Amount for any and all damage, loss and expense (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding) whether involving a third party claim or a claim solely between the parties hereto (" _Damages_ ") suffered or incurred by a Parent Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to:

 

 (i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the Company or the Holder Representative under this Agreement, read for purposes of this Article VIII without reference to Material Adverse Effect (except in the case of Section 3.7(a)) to be true and correct at the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date or the failure of the Closing Certificate delivered at the Closing by the Company (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include the certificate delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 7.2(c)) to be true and correct at and as of the Closing Date; and

 

 (ii) any breach of a covenant or agreement to be performed by the Company pursuant to this Agreement; and

 

 (iii) Excluded Taxes; provided that

 

 (A) no Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any such claim (or series of related claims) pursuant to this Section 8.2 where the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such claim (or related claims) does not exceed $20,000 (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") (and the amount of such Damages with respect to unrelated claims shall not be aggregated for purposes of clause (B));

 

 (B) the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2 unless the aggregate amount of Damages for which all Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2 exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which case the Parent Indemnified Parties shall, subject to Section 8.2(a)(iii)(C) below, be entitled to indemnification for the full amount of all such Damages, including the Basket;

 

 (C) the aggregate amount of all Damages to which all Parent Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall in no event exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount; and

 

 (D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including without limitation and for the avoidance of doubt Section 3.9(a), except to the extent of any breach of the representation and warranty in Section 3.9(d), no indemnity is provided under this Agreement to any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to the amount of or the availability

   

of any net operating loss (" _NOL_ ") or NOL Carryforward that arose in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period (any such NOL or NOL Carryforward, a " _Pre-Closing
NOL_ ") or with respect to any reduction in the amount of any Pre-Closing NOL
for any reason, including without limitation, greater amounts of income being
recognized in any Pre-Closing Tax Period than previously reported.

 

 (b) Effective at and after the Closing, Parent hereby indemnifies each holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company SARs or Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time and their affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Holder Indemnified Parties_ ") for and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually suffered or incurred by a Holder Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to:

 

 (i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Parent under this Agreement, read for purposes of this Article VIII without reference to Material Adverse Effect (except in the case of Section 4.7(a)) to be true and correct at the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date or the failure of the Closing Certificate to be true and correct at and as of Closing;

 

 (ii) any breach of covenant or agreement to be performed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement; and

 

 (iii) the failure of the LLC Merger to be consummated on the Closing Date; provided that

 

 (A) no Holder Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any such claim (or series of related claims) pursuant to this Section 8.2 where the amount of Damages with respect to such claim (or related claims) does not exceed the De Minimis Amount (and the amount of such Damages with respect to unrelated claims shall not be aggregated for purposes of clause (B));

 

 (B) the Holder Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2 unless the aggregate amount of Damages for which all Holder Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2 exceeds the Basket, in which case the Holder Indemnified Parties shall, subject to Section 8.2(b)(iii)(C), be entitled to indemnification for the full amount of all such Damages, including the Basket; and

 

 (C) the aggregate amount of all Damages to which all Holder Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall in no event exceed $35,000,000.

 

 (c) For tax purposes, any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

 8.3. _Third Party Claim Procedures_.

   

 (a) The party seeking indemnification under Section 8.2 (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. The Holder Representative shall give and receive notices on behalf of the Escrow Participating Holders and the Holder Indemnified Parties. " _Indemnifying Party_ " means (i) in the case of any claim for indemnification brought by a Holder Indemnified Party, Parent and (ii) in the case of any claim for indemnification brought by a Parent Indemnified Party, the Holder Representative, solely for the purpose of receiving notice and controlling the defense and settlement of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.3 and Section 8.4; _provided_ that in no circumstance shall the Holder Representative have any obligation to indemnify any party pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 (b) Except as provided below, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to control and select counsel (subject to the Indemnified Partys right to reasonably object) for such defense at its expense.

 

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, denied, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim, the settlement is in excess of the maximum liability set forth in Section 8.2, or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , that no Indemnified Party shall settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party if (A) the Indemnified Party does not irrevocably waive all claims to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim, (B) any amount is required to be paid by the Indemnifying Party or from the Indemnification Escrow Amount in respect of such Third Party Claim, (C) the settlement does not release the Indemnifying Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or (D) the settlement imposes ongoing obligations on, or injunctive or other equitable relief against, the Indemnifying Party. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume such control, and shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel, if (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed, within twenty (20) business days after receipt of a Notice in respect of the applicable Third Party Claim, to assume the defense of such claim or to notify the Indemnified Party in writing that it will assume the defense of such claim, (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are not available to, or the assertion of which would be adverse to the

   

interests of, the Indemnified Party or (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have
been advised in writing by counsel that the assumption of such defense by the
Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential
conflict of interest (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties, other than local counsel). To the extent the defense of any Third
Party Claim is assumed by the Holder Representative as the Indemnifying Party,
the costs and expenses of such defense and any settlement or compromise of
such Third Party Claim shall be paid from the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
and Parent, the Company and the Holder Representative shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse such portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount as
is reasonably requested in writing by the Holder Representative to pay such
costs and expenses.

 

 (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

 (e) If any payment is made on a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and shall be entitled to pursue recovery against the applicable insurers or other Persons in respect of such benefits or other claims. To the extent the defense of any Third Party Claim is assumed by the Holder Representative as the Indemnifying Party, the costs and expenses of such defense and any settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim shall be paid from the Escrow Account. Parent, the Company and the Holder Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse such portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount as is reasonably requested in writing by the Holder Representative to pay such costs and expenses.

 

 8.4. _Direct Claim Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under Section 8.2 against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

 8.5. _Calculation of Damages_.

   

 (a) The amount of any Damages payable under Section 8.2 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor (net of any expenses incurred in securing such recovery). If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 

 (b) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 for consequential, special, exemplary, indirect or punitive Damages (except to the extent included in any Third Party Claim).

 

 (c) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage or from third parties for any Damages payable under Section 8.2, provided that such efforts will not limit the timing or amount of Damages payable under Section 8.2 during pendency of such insurance claims.

 

 (d) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of any Damages payable to the Parent Indemnified Parties under Section 8.2 shall be made solely from funds available in the Escrow Account.

 

 (e) In determining the amount of any Damages for which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any such Damages will be determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized in the year in which such Damages were incurred (and any prior year) in cash, credit or a reduction of Taxes otherwise payable, in each case as a result of such Damages. Additionally, if any Indemnified Party realizes any additional Tax benefit in cash, credit or a reduction of Taxes otherwise payable, in each case as a result of such Damages in the two years after such Damages were incurred, such Indemnified Party will promptly refund to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such Tax benefit.

 

 8.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, this Article VIII will provide the exclusive remedy for any and all claims under this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, except remedies for common law fraud pursuant to claims asserted only against the Persons committing such common law fraud or with respect to matters for which the remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief are available.

 

 8.7. _Indemnity Escrow_.

 

 (a) The amounts of any Damages payable to the Parent Indemnified Parties under Section 8.2 shall, in each case, be paid by release out of cash held in the Escrow Account (the " _Indemnification Escrow Property_ ") to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party from the Escrow Account.

   

 (b) On the Survival Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall release all or a portion of the Indemnification Escrow Property to the Escrow Participating Holders such that, following such release, the amounts remaining in the Escrow Account equals only the amount, if any, of claims for indemnification under Section 8.2 properly asserted prior to such date by the Parent Indemnified Parties in writing in accordance with Article VIII but not yet resolved as of the Survival Termination Date (the " _Unresolved Claims_ "). Such amounts shall be released to the Escrow Participating Holders, pro rata in accordance with their respective Escrow Percentages. The amounts retained in the Escrow Account in respect of any Unresolved Claim shall be released by the Escrow Agent upon final resolution of any Unresolved Claim in respect of which such amounts had been retained (to the extent not utilized to satisfy valid claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2) in accordance with this Section 8.7 and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

 (c) Promptly (and in any event within five (5) business days) upon any person becoming entitled to release of amounts from the Escrow Account pursuant to this Article VIII or the Escrow Agreement, Parent and the Holder Representative shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to so release such amounts.

 (c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before September 23, 2010 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall have been caused by, or resulted from, the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement, other than a breach of such partys representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement;

 

 (d) by either the Company or Parent (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company or the Holder Representative, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set

the case of termination by the Company) and that (if curable) is not cured by

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d) as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement (other than any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Article IV hereof or any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 5.3, Section 5.4 or Section 6.10 or any unintentional breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 1.7(c), Section 6.2, Section 6.3 or Section 11.8) or (B) by either party pursuant to Section 9.1(c) and at the time of such termination the terminating party could

agreement set forth in Section 5.3, Section 5.4, or Section 6.10 or any
unintentional breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 1.7(c),
Section 6.2, Section 6.3 or Section 11.8) and, in either case, at such time
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2, and Section 7.3(d) have
been satisfied or waived (excluding those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied or waived at Closing), other than such conditions that have
not been satisfied as a result of the material breach of Parent or Merger Sub

by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the
$75,000,000 (the " _Parent Breach Termination Fee_ ") on the first business
day following such termination; or

 

 (iv) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d) as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement (other than any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Article III or any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 5.1, Section 5.2 or Section 6.10 or any unintentional breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 1.7(c), Section 6.2, Section 6.6, Section 6.8(a) or Section 11.8) or (B) by either party pursuant to Section 9.1(c) and at the time of such termination the terminating party could have terminated the agreement pursuant to 9.1(d) as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement (other than any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Article III or any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 5.1, Section 5.2 or Section 6.10 or any unintentional breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 1.7(c), Section 6.2, Section 6.6, Section 6.8(a) or Section 11.8) and, in either case, at such time the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2(e), Section 7.2(f) and Section 7.3 have been satisfied or waived (excluding those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at Closing), other than such conditions that have not been satisfied as a result of the material breach of the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, then the Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $75,000,000 (the " _Company Breach Termination Fee_ " and, together with the Parent Breach Termination Fee, the Change of Recommendation Termination Fee and the Stockholder Vote Termination Fee, the " _Termination Fees_ ") on the first business day following such termination.

 

 (v) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will either Parent or the Company be obligated to pay more than one Termination Fee.

 

 (b) Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement. If any party hereto becomes obligated to pay a Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.3, such party shall additionally pay to the party entitled to such payment (i) interest on the amount of such Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the per annum rate equal to the sum of (A) the rate publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, as of the date such payment was required to be made, as such banks prime lending rate and (B) 2% and (ii) if, in order to obtain such payment, the party entitled to payment of a Termination Fee commences a suit for payment of such Termination Fee that results in a judgment against such party, the party obligated to pay such Termination Fee shall reimburse such party for its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)

   

incurred in connection with such suit. The parties hereto specifically
acknowledge and agree that (i) no Termination Fee payable hereunder
constitutes a penalty, but rather represents liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the party entitled to such Termination
Fee in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Merger and (ii) the applicable Termination Fees shall be the exclusive
remedy of the party entitled to such Termination Fees following termination of
this Agreement. Except as provided in Section 11.10, no party shall be
entitled to bring a claim for or seek to recover damages for breach of this
Agreement in excess of the applicable Termination Fees to which such party is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 9.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of Parent, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

 

 9.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

The Holder Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority Holders. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary hereunder, the Holder Representative shall have no liability or obligation of any nature under this Agreement to any party hereto or any third party beneficiary hereof, other than as a result of a breach of its representation set forth in Section 10.4.

 

 10.4. _Representations and Warranties_.

 

 (a) The Holder Representative has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Holder Representative has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement.

 

 (b) The execution and delivery by the Holder Representative of this Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, a party, and the performance by the Holder Representative of its obligations hereunder do not and will not conflict with, violate any provision of, any applicable law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to, or the organizational documents of, the Holder Representative.

 

 10.5. _Reliance_. The provisions of this Article X shall in no way impose any obligations on Parent, except that the last sentence of Section 10.3 shall be binding on Parent and Merger Sub. Parent (i) shall be entitled to rely upon, shall have no liability to the Holders with respect to, actions, decisions and determinations of the Holder Representative and (ii) shall be entitled to assume that all actions, decisions and determinations of the Holder Representative are fully authorized by all of the Holders.

 11.5. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or the effectiveness or validity of any provision in any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

 

 11.6. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and wholly performed within such state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies under this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) after the Closing, current and former affiliates and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries are intended third party beneficiaries of Section 6.12 and shall be entitled to enforce their rights thereunder, (ii) after the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Parties and the Holder Indemnified Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of Article VIII and shall be entitled to enforce their rights thereunder, (iii) all holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs are intended third party beneficiaries of Section 9.3 and the Holder Representative shall be entitled to enforce the rights of such parties thereunder on behalf of such parties and no other Person (including such holders) shall have the right to enforce such rights, (iv) the Persons described in the second sentence of Section 11.11 that are not parties hereto are intended third party beneficiaries of Section 11.11 and shall be entitled to enforce their rights thereunder, (v) the Representatives of the Company are intended third-party beneficiaries of the second to last sentence of Section 6.5(b), and (vi) the Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of the second to last sentence of Section 11.6 (but no other section or provision of this Agreement) and each Financing Source shall be entitled to enforce its rights under that sentence.

Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, affiliate, agent, attorney or affiliate of any party to this Agreement shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or

   

other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company, the Holder
Representative, Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement (whether for
indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided_
