As long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to <U>Article X</U>, in the event the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries elects to sell any of its loan assets any time after January 1, 2018 to a third party (the &ldquo;<U>Proposed
Transfer</U>&rdquo;), the Company shall offer the Parent a right of first refusal to purchase all of such loan assets that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries proposes to transfer to a third party purchaser at the same price and on the same
terms and conditions as those offered to such third party purchaser in the Proposed Transfer. The Company shall deliver a
notice (the &ldquo;<U>Proposed Transfer Notice</U>&rdquo;) to the Parent, which shall contain the material terms and
conditions (including price and form of consideration) of the Proposed Transfer. To exercise its right of first refusal
under this <U>Section 5.3</U>, the Parent must deliver written notice to the Company within one (1) Business Day after
delivery of the Proposed Transfer Notice and shall be required to close on the Proposed Transfer, consistent with the terms
and conditions set forth in the Proposed Transfer Notice, within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the Proposed
Transfer Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Parent fails to provide its election notice or fails to close on the
Proposed Transfer, in each case, within the time periods set forth in this <U>Section 5.3</U>, then the Parent shall be
deemed to have forfeited any right to purchase any of the loan assets subject to the Proposed Transfer, and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and each of its applicable Subsidiaries shall be free to
sell all of the loan assets subject to the Proposed Transfer to the prospective third party purchaser on terms and conditions
substantially similar to (and in no event more favorable than) the terms and conditions set forth in the Proposed Transfer
Notice.</FONT></P>

by the actual fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder
Representative will reimburse the Company Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable

its own funds on behalf of the Company Equityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,

this Agreement, including <U>Section 11.7</U> hereof, are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder

against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Stockholder Representative in performing such actions.</P>

Subsidiary, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on
the one hand, and Parent, UCBI and Merger Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants
and obligations of the other under this Agreement and this right shall include the right of the Company to cause the Merger to
be consummated. Parent, UCBI and Merger Subsidiary hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by Parent, UCBI or Merger
Subsidiary, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Parent, UCBI and Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement. The
parties hereto further agree that (a) by seeking the remedies provided for in this <U>Section 11.8</U>, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available under this Agreement (including monetary damages)
if this Agreement has been terminated or if the remedies provided for in this <U>Section 11.8 </U>are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (b)&nbsp;nothing set forth in this <U>Section 11.8</U> shall require any party to institute any proceeding
for (or limit any party&rsquo;s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this <U>Section 11.8</U> prior
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under <U>Article X</U> (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor

Representation</U><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></FONT>. In any proceeding by or against any Parent Group Party wherein
any Parent Group Party asserts or prosecutes any Legal Proceeding under, or otherwise seeks to enforce, this Agreement, Parent
agrees in connection with such proceeding: (a)&nbsp;that no Parent Group Party or counsel therefor will move to seek disqualification
of Greenberg Traurig; (b) to waive any right any Parent Group Party may have to assert the attorney-client privilege against Greenberg
Traurig or the Stockholder Representative, any Company Equity Holder or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any
communication with or information contained in Greenberg Traurig&rsquo;s possession or files; and (c) to consent to the representation
of the Stockholder Representative, any Company Equityholder or any of their respective Affiliates by Greenberg Traurig, notwithstanding
that Greenberg Traurig has or may have represented the Stockholder Representative, any Company Equityholder or any of their respective
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) as counsel in connection with any matter, including any transaction (including the
Transactions), negotiation, investigation, proceeding or action, prior to or after the Closing. This consent and waiver extends
to Greenberg Traurig&rsquo;s representing the Stockholder Representative, any Company Equityholder or any of their respective
Affiliates against Parent or any Parent Group Party in litigation, arbitration or mediation in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions. Any privilege attaching as a result of Greenberg Traurig&rsquo;s representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the Transactions shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, <U>provided</U> that such privilege
from and after the Closing shall be assigned to and controlled by the Stockholder Representative. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of the parties hereto agrees to take the steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Greenberg
Traurig representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions shall survive the Closing, remain
in effect and be assigned to and controlled by the Stockholder Representative. As to any communications among Greenberg Traurig,
the Acquired Companies and the Stockholder Representative that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege (collectively,
the &ldquo;<U>Privileged Communications</U>&rdquo;), Parent Group Party (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation),
together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action or Legal Proceeding against or involving any of the parties hereto or any of their respective
Non-Recourse Parties after the Closing. Accordingly, no Parent Group Party (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation),
shall, without the Stockholder Representative&rsquo;s written consent, have access to any Privileged Communications, or to the
files of Greenberg Traurig relating to its engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the Stockholder Representative and its Affiliates (and not the Company) shall
be the sole holders of the Privileged Communications with respect to such engagement, and Parent Group Party (including, after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Greenberg Traurig in respect
of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the Stockholder Representative and its Affiliates (and not the Company
or any other Parent Group Party) shall hold such property rights and (iii) Greenberg Traurig shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such Privileged Communications or files to any Parent Group Party by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Greenberg Traurig and the Company or otherwise.</P>
