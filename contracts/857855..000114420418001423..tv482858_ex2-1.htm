Certificate(s), and that such Shares are owned by such holder free and clear
of any and all Liens, (2) a waiver by the holder thereof of any
appraisal rights in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificates,
and (3) a ratification by the holder thereof of the appointment of the
Stockholder Representative); and

  



  

(ii) the Certificates held of record by such holder evidencing the
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (or if
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, an affidavit of
that fact and, if required by Parent, the execution of an unsecured indemnity
agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent by such holder against any Legal
Proceeding that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate).

  



  

Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent (or alternatively,
delivery of an affidavit and indemnity agreement reasonably acceptable
to Parent), together with such Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange the consideration set
forth above in _Section 2.7(a)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Company
Stockholder presents to the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Effective Time
such Company Stockholder's Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock (if any), or Series C Preferred Stock, then such
Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive at Closing payment for such
Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock (if any), or
Series C Preferred Stock by wire transfer on the Closing Date in
immediately available funds to an account designated by such Company
Stockholder. If any portion of the aggregate consideration to be paid as set
forth in this Agreement is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of exchange that (x) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the exchange to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable and (y) such Person execute and deliver
to Parent a certificate containing an appropriate representation regarding
ownership and title to the Shares represented by the applicable Certificate(s)
and a corresponding unsecured indemnity agreement reasonably acceptable to
Parent against any claims or Legal Proceedings that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate(s). As of the Effective Time, each
Certificate shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Section 2.10_ , the
consideration into which the Shares represented thereby shall have been
converted pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_.

  



    

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the aggregate consideration set forth above in _Section 2.7(a)_
, represented by such Certificates as provided in this  _Article II_.

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Gross Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ that remains unclaimed by
the holders of Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent and any holder of Shares who has not exchanged such Shares for the
Gross Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.10_ prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Gross
Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with
respect thereto, in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon.

  



  

(e) None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any former Company Equityholder for any Gross Merger
Consideration or interest thereon properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date that the consideration
for such Shares would escheat, any Shares represented thereby, or cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, automatically become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Surviving Corporation and any Acquired Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the cash consideration otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this _Article II_ , and, if a deficiency exists after
first making such withholding from the cash consideration payable pursuant to
this _Article II_ , obtain the balance of any such deficiency from any such
Person in cash, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax Law.
The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that all such amounts may
be withheld solely from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this _Article
II_ and, if a deficiency exists after first making such withholding from the
cash consideration payable pursuant to this _Article II_ , the balance of any
such deficiency may be obtained in cash from such Person, and no such
withholdings need be taken from any UCBI Stock payable to such Person. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange Agent,
the Stockholder Representative, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, and paid to the applicable Taxing Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the
Stockholder Representative, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.11. _Dissenting Holders_. Notwithstanding any provision
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, all Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder (a "
_Dissenting Holder_ ") who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised
appraisal rights of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(such Shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ "
until such time as such Dissenting Holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such Dissenting Holder's appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such
Shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Per Common
Share Merger Consideration, the Series A Preference Amount, and/or the Series
C Preference Amount as the case may be, payable in respect of such Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ hereof, but instead shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262
of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such Dissenting
Holder's right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Dissenting Holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such
Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect
of such Shares pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ , without interest thereon. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) reasonable updates with respect to negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, or offer to settle, or settle any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.12. _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further
assignments or assurances in law or otherwise are necessary or desirable to
vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation, all rights, title and interests in all real estate and other
property and all privileges, powers and franchises of the Acquired Companies
and Merger Subsidiary, then the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers
and directors, in the name and on behalf of the Acquired Companies and Merger
Subsidiary, shall execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments and
assurances in law and do all things commercially reasonable and proper to
vest, perfect or confirm title to such property or rights in the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purpose of this Agreement, and the
proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of the Acquired Companies and Merger Subsidiary to
take any and all such action.

Company is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the

business as now conducted. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified or
authorized to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing under
the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the
ownership of its properties requires such qualification or authorization
except where the failure to be so qualified, authorized or in good standing

in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent in the Data Room (a) complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation or other comparable organizational document, as applicable, of
each Acquired Company as in effect on the date hereof; and (b) bylaws,
operating or limited liability company agreements or other comparable
governing documents, and all amendments thereto of each Acquired Company as

document, instrument or certificate contemplated by this Agreement or to be
executed by the Company in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (the " _Company Documents_ "), and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Company
Documents and the consummation of the Transactions, except for the required
approvals of the Company Stockholders in connection with the consummation of
the Merger, have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the
part of the Company. This Agreement has been, and each of the Company
Documents will be at or prior to the Closing, duly and validly executed and

delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes,
and each of the other Company Documents will constitute, the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at
law or in equity).

  



  

Section 3.3. _Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties._

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3(a)_, and provided that the
notifications and approvals set forth in _Schedule 3.3(b)_  are made or
obtained, none of the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
or the Company Documents, the consummation of the Transactions, or compliance
by the Company with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will conflict
with, or result in any violation of, breach of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration, modification or loss of any material
benefit under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws or comparable organizational documents of any Acquired Company; (ii)

assets of any Acquired Company are bound; or (iv) any applicable Law, other
than, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, modifications
or losses that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger or the other Transactions or result in material liability to any
Acquired Company, or in the case of clause (ii), such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations,
modifications or losses that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact the operations of
any Acquired Company following the Closing.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3(b)_, no consent, waiver,
approval, Order, Permit or authorization of, or declaration, registration or
filing with, or notification to, any Person or Governmental Authority is
required on the part of any Acquired Company in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Company Documents or the compliance by
the Company with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, or the consummation
of the Transactions, except for (i) the filing of a Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (ii) compliance with the
applicable requirements of the HSR Act; (iii) any applicable filings under
state securities, "Blue Sky" or takeover laws; and (iv) to the Company's
Knowledge, such consents, waivers, approvals, Orders, Permits or

Companies as of September 30, 2017 and the related consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows of the Acquired Companies for the nine month period

Section 3.8. _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.8(a)_ , the Acquired
Companies have duly and timely filed (subject to applicable extensions)
all material Tax Returns that they were required to file under applicable
Laws and regulations. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all
material respects and were prepared in substantial compliance with all
applicable Laws and regulations. All income Taxes and other material Taxes
due and owing by the Acquired Companies have been paid, except for Taxes
reserved for on the Financial Statements or accrued since the date of the
Financial Statements in the Ordinary Course of Business or Taxes, the
liability for which is being challenged by an Acquired Company. The unpaid
Taxes of each Acquired Company (A) did not, as of the most recent fiscal
month end, exceed the reserve for Liability for Taxes in the Financial
Statements or accrued since the date of the Financial Statements (rather than
in any notes thereto) and (B) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the
passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom
and practice of the Acquired Companies in filing their Tax Returns. Since the
Balance Sheet Date, no Acquired Company has incurred any liability for Taxes
arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP,
outside the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past custom and
practice and except for any changes and modifications required as a result of
any change in any Tax Law. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.8(a)_ , no
Acquired Company is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return. No written material claim has been made and is
currently outstanding by a Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where an
Acquired Company does not file Tax Returns that such Acquired Company is or
may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Except for Permitted
Exceptions or as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(a)_ , there are no material Liens
for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of
any Acquired Company.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.8(b)_ , there has not been
any audit of any Acquired Company Tax Return by the IRS or any state, local
or foreign tax authority since January 1, 2011, and no Acquired Company has
been notified in writing by the IRS or any state, local or foreign Taxing
Authority that any such audit is contemplated or pending. No Acquired Company
has received from any federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxing authority
(including jurisdictions where any Acquired Company have not filed Tax
Returns) any written notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any
material amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing
authority against any Acquired Company.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.8(c)_ or with respect to
commercial Contracts to which an Acquired Company is a party and that do not
principally involve the allocation or sharing the payment of, or liability
for, Taxes, including, without limitation, any Contract relating to the
leasing of equipment in the Ordinary Course of Business, no Acquired Company
is a party to any Contract with any third party (excluding other Acquired
Companies) relating to allocating or sharing the payment of, or liability for,
Taxes. No Acquired Company has liability for the Taxes of any third party
(excluding other Acquired Companies) under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6, by
Contract or as a transferee or successor.

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Except with respect to equipment leases entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business, all material Taxes which the Company is
obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder or third party have been paid or accrued.

  



  

(e) No Acquired Company has been a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of
the Code.

  



  

(f) No Acquired Company has been either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock
intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. No
Acquired Company has consummated or participated in, or is currently
participating in, any transaction that was or is a "tax shelter" transaction
as defined in Section 6662 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(g) Except with respect to equipment leases entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business, each Acquired Company has withheld and paid
all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder or third party.

  



  

(h) None of the Acquired Companies has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

  



  

(i) None of the Acquired Companies has been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Code Section
897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in Code Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii). Each of the Acquired Companies has disclosed on
their federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give
rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning
of Code Section 6662.

  



  

(j) No Acquired Company will be required to include any item of
income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of any:

  



  

(i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on

forth a list as of the date hereof of all leases or subleases of real
property, identifying the address thereof, by any Acquired Company
(individually, a " _Real Property Lease_ " and, collectively, the " _Real
Property Leases_ "). Copies of the Real Property Leases have been made
available to Parent in the Data Room. No Acquired Company has received any
written notice of any default, event or occurrence that has resulted or would
result (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both) in a
default in any material respect by any Acquired Company under any Real
Property Lease. Assuming good title in the respective landlords, the Real
Property Leases are in full force and effect and constitute valid and binding
agreements of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of
commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). No Acquired
Company has received any written notice of any material default or any event
that, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute such a
default by any Acquired Company under any Real Property Lease. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the real property subject to the Real
Property Leases is in conformity in all material respects with all applicable
Laws, including all applicable zoning laws, ordinances and regulations
affecting such Real Property Leases. No representation or warranty is made
herein regarding the status of the fee title (and any matters pertaining to
such fee title) of any real property subject to the Real Property Leases; it
being understood and agreed that the provisions of this _Section 3.9_ , as
they relate to the property subject to the Real Property Leases, pertain only
to the leasehold interest of the Acquired Companies.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.9_ , to the Knowledge of the
Company, the buildings subject to the Real Property Leases are
in commercially reasonable order and repair, normal wear and tear excepted.
Except for employees of the Acquired Companies who work from their
residences, the real property subject to the Real Property Leases includes all
real property currently used by the Acquired Companies in the conduct of
their business as currently conducted.

  



  

Section 3.10. _Tangible Personal Property_. Except as set forth in
_Schedule 3.10_ or as disposed of in the Ordinary Course of Business since
the Balance Sheet Date, each Acquired Company has good title to, a valid
leasehold interest in, or a valid right to use, free and clear of any Liens
(other than Permitted Exceptions), all of the material items of tangible
personal property reflected in the Balance Sheet as used or owned by it.
_Schedule 3.10_ sets forth all leases of personal property leased by any
Acquired Company involving annual payments in excess of $100,000 (" _Personal
Property Leases_ "). No Acquired Company has received any written notice of

or both, would constitute such a default by any Acquired Company under any
Personal Property Lease.

All such registrations for the Registered Intellectual Property are in full
force and effect and have not expired or been abandoned.

  



  

(b) The Acquired Companies own or have a valid right to use all
material Intellectual Property currently used by them in the conduct of their
business as currently conducted, except for the failure to have such right to
use that would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, the conduct by the Acquired Companies
of their respective businesses as currently conducted by them does not
Infringe the rights with respect to Intellectual Property owned by any
third Person. The Acquired Companies have not made any claims against third
parties within the past three years alleging Infringement of the Intellectual
Property owned or used by any of them in the conduct of their business as
currently conducted and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
Acquired Companies' rights in any Intellectual Property owned by any of them
are being Infringed.

  



  

(c) The representations and warranties contained in this _Section
3.11_ constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Acquired Companies relating to, or in connection with, Intellectual Property

remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles
of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at
law or in equity). No Acquired Company is in material default under any
Material Contract to which it is a party and no Acquired Company has received
any written notice of any default or event that, with notice or lapse of time,
or both, would constitute such a default by any of the Acquired Companies.

omission has occurred since the date of the most recent determination or
opinion letter which would materially adversely affect its qualification.

 _Article IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF PARENT, UCBI AND MERGER SUBSIDIARY_

  



  

Except as otherwise disclosed to the Company in the disclosure schedules
delivered to the Company by Parent, UCBI, and Merger Subsidiary, Parent, UCBI,
and Merger Subsidiary, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company and the Company Equityholders:

  



  

Section 4.1. _Organization and Good Standing_. Parent and UCBI are
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which they are incorporated and have all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business. Merger Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good
status under the Laws of Delaware. Parent owns 1,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Subsidiary, which shares represent all
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Subsidiary. Merger
Subsidiary has not engaged in any activities and does not hold any assets
except (in each case) as necessary to be a party to and consummate the Merger.

  



  

Section 4.2. _Authorization_. Each of Parent, UCBI, and Merger
Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate
contemplated by this Agreement or to be executed by it in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions (the " _Acquiror Documents_ "), and to
consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Acquiror Documents and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all requisite action on the part of Parent, UCBI, and Merger
Subsidiary. This Agreement has been, and each of the Acquiror Documents will
be at or prior to the Closing, duly and validly executed and delivered by
Parent, UCBI, and/or Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be, and (assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and
thereto) this Agreement and each of the Acquiror Documents constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, UCBI, and/or Merger
Subsidiary, as the case may be, enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting creditors'
rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good
faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

  



  

Section 4.3. _Financial Ability_. Parent has sufficient immediately
available funds to consummate the Transactions and to pay the Merger
Consideration. Parent acknowledges and agrees that Parent's performance of its
obligations under this Agreement is not in any way contingent upon the
availability of financing to Parent.

  



  

Section 4.4. _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time and immediately
after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the Merger, the
payment of the Gross Merger Consideration, and all of the related fees and
expenses of Merger Subsidiary, UCBI, and Parent in connection therewith, (a)
the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed (i) the value of all Liabilities
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, including contingent and
other Liabilities, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the
probable Liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on
their existing debts (including contingent Liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured; (b) the Surviving Corporation will not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it and its Subsidiaries are engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c)
the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its and its Subsidiaries'
Liabilities, including contingent and other Liabilities, as they mature. For
purposes of the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its Liabilities, including contingent and other
Liabilities, as they mature" means that the Surviving Corporation will be
able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its and its Subsidiaries'
obligations as they become due.

Section 4.5. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.

  



  

(a) _Non-Contravention_. None of the execution and delivery by
Parent, UCBI, or Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement or the Acquiror
Documents, the consummation of the Transactions, or compliance by Parent,
UCBI, or Merger Subsidiary with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will
conflict with, or result in any violation of, breach of or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration, modification or loss of any material
benefit under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws or comparable organizational documents of either Parent, UCBI, or
Merger Subsidiary; (ii)  any Contract or Permit to which either Parent, UCBI,

properties or assets are bound; (iii) any Order of any Governmental
Authority applicable to either Parent, UCBI, or Merger Subsidiary or by which

material liability to Parent or UCBI, or in the case of clause (ii), such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations, modifications or losses that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact the
operations of Parent or UCBI following the Closing.

  



  

(b) _Approvals and Consents_. Except as set forth in _Schedule
4.5(b)_ , no consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or authorization of, or
declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Person or Governmental
Authority is required on the part of either Parent, UCBI, or Merger
Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Acquiror Documents or the compliance by Parent, UCBI, and Merger

Section 4.8. _Disclosure Reports; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The UCBI Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act, and UCBI has taken no action designed to, or which to
its knowledge is likely to have the effect of, terminating the registration
of the UCBI Stock under the Exchange Act nor has UCBI received any
notification that the SEC is contemplating terminating such registration. UCBI
has timely filed all forms, proxy statements, reports, schedules and other
documents, including all certifications and statements required by the
Exchange Act or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required to be filed by
the Exchange Act since January 1, 2015 (the " _UCBI Exchange Act Reports_
"). The UCBI Exchange Act Reports (i) at the time filed, (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date
of such filing) complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the securities laws and other applicable laws and (ii) did
not, at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such amended or
superseded filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each offering or sale of securities by
UCBI (i) was either registered under the 1933 Act or made pursuant to a valid
exemption from registration, (ii) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the securities laws and other applicable laws,
except for immaterial late "blue sky" filings, including disclosure and
broker/dealer registration requirements, and (iii) was made pursuant to
offering documents, which did not, at the time of the offering (or, in the
case of registration statements, at the effective date thereof) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated in the offering documents or necessary to make the statements in
such documents, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  



  

(b) All of the financial statements to be included in the UCBI
Registration Statement, including any related notes thereto (those filed with
the SEC are collectively referred to as the " _UCBI Financial Statements_ "),
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material respects, subject
in the case of unaudited financial statements to normal year-end adjustments
and the absence of notes, and present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of UCBI
as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein.

  



  

Section 4.9. _Regulatory Reports_. The year-end Reports of
Condition and Income filed by Parent with the FDIC and the Forms F.R. Y-6 and
F.R. Y-9SP filed by UCBI with the Federal Reserve for or during each of the
three (3) years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, together with all
such other reports filed by UCBI and the Parent for or during the same three
(3)-year period with the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance, if any,
and with any other applicable regulatory or governmental agencies have been
prepared in accordance with applicable rules and regulations applied on a
basis consistent with prior periods and contain all information required to
be presented therein in accordance with such rules and regulations.

  



  

Section 4.10. _Absence of Changes_. Since September 30, 2017, there
has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of Parent or UCBI, or in any of its
relationships with customers, employees, lessors or others, other than
changes in the ordinary course of business, none of which individually or in
the aggregate has had, or which would reasonably be expected to have, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.11. _Compliance_. Other than investments to satisfy
regulatory requirements, neither UCBI nor the Parent is a party to any
agreement with any individual or group regarding Community Reinvestment Act
matters and, to its knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist, which would
cause Parent: (i) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to
be assigned a rating for Community Reinvestment Act purposes by federal or
state bank regulators of lower than "satisfactory"; (ii) to be deemed to be
operating in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing
regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 103), the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with
respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money
laundering statute, rule or regulation; the Truth in Lending Act and
Regulation Z, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,
any regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or
any regulations relating to unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices
under federal or state law; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory
compliance with the applicable privacy of customer information requirements
contained in any federal and state privacy laws and regulations, including,
without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the
information security program adopted by Parent pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part
364. Furthermore, the board of directors of Parent has adopted and Parent has
implemented an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and
appropriate customer identification verification procedures that has not been
deemed ineffective by any governmental agency and that meets the requirements
of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act.

Section 4.12. _Access_. Parent, UCBI, and its representatives have
been given full access to the assets, books, records, Contracts and employees
of the Acquired Companies, and have been given the opportunity to meet with
officers and other representatives of the Acquired Companies for the purpose
of investigating and obtaining information regarding the Acquired Companies'
business, operations and legal affairs. Neither Parent, UCBI, nor any of its
representatives has had unauthorized access to, or has used, any confidential
information of the Acquired Companies regarding the process undertaken by the
Acquired Companies in connection with the Acquired Companies' solicitation of
potential offers or the terms of any such other offers.

  



  

Section 4.13. _Investment Intent/Accredited Investor_. The Shares are
being acquired by Merger Subsidiary and Parent for their own account and
without a view to the public distribution of the Shares or any interest
therein. Parent and Merger Subsidiary have sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of their investment in the Shares, and Parent and Merger
Subsidiary are capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment, including a complete loss of their investment in the Shares.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary are each an "accredited investor" as defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the 1933 Act. In evaluating the
suitability of an investment in the Shares, Parent and Merger Subsidiary have
relied solely upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
made by the Company herein and Parent and Merger Subsidiary have not relied
upon any other representations or other information (whether oral or
written and including any projections or supplemental data) made or supplied
by or on behalf of the Company, the Company Equityholders or any Affiliate,
employee, agent or other representative of the Company or the Company
Equityholders. Parent and Merger Subsidiary understand and agree that Parent
may not sell or dispose of any of the Surviving Corporation's capital stock
other than pursuant to a registered offering or in a transaction exempt from
the registration requirements of applicable securities Laws. Parent
acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under federal or state
securities Laws.

  



  

Section 4.14. _Valid Issuance of UCBI Stock; Other Compliance
Matters_. The UCBI Stock, when issued, sold and delivered in accordance with
the terms and for the consideration set forth in this Agreement, will be
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations of each Company Equityholder set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal delivered by such Company Equityholder pursuant to this
Agreement, the Shares will be issued in compliance with all applicable federal
and state securities laws. No registration under the 1933 Act is required for
the offer and sale of the Stock Consideration by UCBI to the Company
Equityholders as contemplated by this Agreement. UCBI is eligible to register
the UCBI Stock issued pursuant to the Merger for resale by the Company
Equityholders on Form S-3 promulgated under the 1933 Act. At the time of
filing the UCBI Registration Statement, and at the time of each post-
effective amendment thereto, including by way of a Section 10.3(a)(3) post-
effective amendment, UCBI (i) was a "well-known seasoned issuer" (as defined
in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act) and (ii) was not an "ineligible issuer" (as
defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act). UCBI has not, in the 12 months
preceding the date hereof, received notice from Nasdaq or any trading market
on which UCBI Stock is or has been listed or quoted to the effect that UCBI
is not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements of such
trading market. UCBI is in compliance with all such listing and maintenance
requirements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement do not violate the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Section 4.15. _Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties made by Parent and UCBI in this  _Article IV_
, neither Parent, UCBI, nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent, its Subsidiaries, or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent and UCBI hereby disclaim any such
other representations or warranties. Parent and UCBI acknowledge and agree
that no Acquired Company nor any other Person has made or is making any
express or implied representation or warranty other than those contained in
_Article III_.

shall offer the Parent a right of first refusal to purchase all of such loan
assets that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries proposes to transfer to a

as those offered to such third party purchaser in the Proposed Transfer. The
Company shall deliver a notice (the " _Proposed Transfer Notice_ ") to the

each case, within the time periods set forth in this _Section 5.3_ , then the
Parent shall be deemed to have forfeited any right to purchase any of the
loan assets subject to the Proposed Transfer, and, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and each of its
applicable Subsidiaries shall be free to sell all of the loan assets subject
to the Proposed Transfer to the prospective third party purchaser on terms and
conditions substantially similar to (and in no event more favorable than) the
terms and conditions set forth in the Proposed Transfer Notice.

 _Article VI 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

  



  

Section 6.1. _Access to Information and Employees_. Upon reasonable
notice, subject to applicable antitrust and other Laws, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of the Acquired Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and the
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives of Parent (the " _Representatives_ "),
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period from the
date hereof to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , to the Acquired Companies' existing
books and records; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such access shall be
conducted at Parent's expense, at reasonable times, under the supervision of
appropriate personnel of the Company and in such a manner as to maintain the
confidentiality of this Agreement and the Transactions and to not interfere
with the normal operation of the business of the Acquired Companies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.1_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, none of the Acquired Companies shall be required
to provide to Parent documents that are subject to a confidentiality
agreement that has not been duly waived and that relates to a party other
than the Acquired Companies, and provided that all documents or other
information subject to attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine
shall be provided only under a joint defense privilege, to the extent
applicable, and Parent and the Acquired Companies shall enter into such
documentation as may reasonably be required to evidence such joint privilege.
Parent agrees that it will not, and it will cause its Representatives to not,
use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. The Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated as of July 27, 2017 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
by the Parent and Navitas Credit Corp., shall apply with respect to
information furnished by the Acquired Companies and their representatives
thereunder or hereunder and any other activities contemplated thereby or
hereby, until the Effective Time and thereafter to the extent provided
therein.

  



  

Section 6.2. _Stockholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the exercise by the board of directors of the Company
of its fiduciary duties, (i) as soon as reasonably possible following the
execution of this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company shall
recommend that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement in any meeting or written consent of the Company Stockholders and
(ii) neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the board of
directors of the Company that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of
adoption of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Within five (5) Business Days following the date of (i) delivery
of the Stockholder Written Consent, or (ii) a meeting of the stockholders of
the Company at which the required Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger and the Transactions, the Company shall deliver to
each holder of Shares that did not execute a Stockholder Written Consent or
did not vote in favor of the foregoing proposals at such stockholder meeting,
as applicable, the Stockholder Notice in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent. The Stockholder Notice shall include therewith a copy
of Section 262 of the DGCL and all such other information as Parent shall
reasonably request and shall be sufficient in form and substance to start the
20 day period during which a Company Stockholder must demand appraisal of
such Company Stockholder's Shares as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL.

Section 6.3. _Notification; Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Filings_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, except to the extent otherwise required by regulatory
considerations or otherwise provided in this _Section 6.3_ , each of the
Company and Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, and to satisfy all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , including: (i) preparing and filing
all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed, performing all
necessary actions or nonactions, and obtaining all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and making all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities)
and taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Authority; (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from
those parties set forth on _Schedule 6.3(a)_ ; (iii) defending any lawsuits or
other Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed; and (iv) executing and delivering
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as may
be reasonably practicable, and in no event later than five Business
Days after the date hereof, Parent and the Company each shall file with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")
Notification and Report Forms relating to the Transactions as required by the
HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws and the preservation of any
applicable attorney-client privilege, Parent and the Company each shall
promptly (i) supply the other with any information which may be required in
order to effectuate such filings; (ii) supply any additional information which
reasonably may be required by the FTC or the DOJ; and (iii) make any further
filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable in
connection therewith. Parent and the Company each shall request early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, and will use
reasonable efforts to obtain such early termination. Parent shall pay all
filing fees for the filing under the HSR Act by all parties, except for any
filing that may arise under Rule 801.2(e) under the HSR Act. Parent will take
any and all commercially reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other Person so as to enable the parties hereto
to expeditiously close the Transactions, provided, however, Parent shall not
be required to consent to any divestiture or other structural or conduct
relief in order to obtain clearance from any Governmental Authority. At the
request of the Company, Parent and its Affiliates shall be obligated to take
commercially reasonable steps to contest, administratively or in court, any
antitrust ruling, Order or other action of any Governmental Authority or any
other Person respecting the Transactions. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, undertake any
Competitive Transaction.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel
to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues
arising under the HSR Act and any other Law at the earliest practicable
dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation include counsel's
undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately informed of communications
from and to personnel of the reviewing Governmental Authorities, and (ii) to
confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with and response to
personnel of such Governmental Authorities and the content of any such
contacts or presentations. Neither the Company nor Parent shall participate in
any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect to any
such filings, applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other party prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent
permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or discussion (which, at the request of
either Parent or the Company, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel
only). The Company and Parent shall each approve the content of any
presentations, white papers or other written materials to be prepared and
submitted to any Governmental Authority in advance of any such submission.

advisors and accountants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be
responsible for (and timely satisfy) the costs of (a) the RandW Insurance

exchange on which its common stock may be listed) or legal process prior to
the Closing, none of the Company Equityholders or Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or the Acquired Companies may issue any press release or make any public
statement without the approval of the other party (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Following the Closing, the
Company's institutional investors shall not be prohibited from disclosure of
its investment in the Acquired Companies, the proceeds received hereunder and
its rate of return on such investment, in each case, to its investors and
prospective investors so long as recipients are bound by customary
obligations of confidentiality with respect to such disclosures, and
the Company's institutional investors shall have the right to disclose
information about the Transactions pursuant to its normal fundraising,
marketing, information or reporting activities. Nothing in this _Section 6.5_
shall be deemed to prohibit any party from making any press release or other
public disclosure required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United
States or non-United States securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or disclosure shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release
or disclosure in advance of the issuance thereof. The Company and the Parent
shall issue a joint press release, in a form and substance that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company and the Parent, announcing the execution of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.6. _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers'
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, and to the extent the Company
or another Acquired Company would be required to do so as of the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying
Party_") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer, director, employee or manager (in the case of a
limited liability company) of any of the Acquired Companies
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Agents_ ") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses, Liabilities or judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement with the approval of the DandO Indemnifying Party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
Person is or was a director, officer, employee or manager of any of the
Acquired Companies and arising out of actions or omissions, occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at
or after, the Effective Time; _provided_ that each DandO Indemnifying Party
shall only be required to indemnify a Company Indemnified Agent pursuant to
this _Section 6.6_ to the extent a corporation is permitted under the Law of
the State of Delaware to indemnify directors, officers and employees, as the
case may be, or those of a direct or indirect subsidiary (and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will pay expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Company
Indemnified Agent to the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_  that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification). In addition, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns shall contain
provisions with respect to indemnification no less favorable to the former
officers and directors than those in effect in the certificate of
incorporation of the Company and the bylaws of the Company with respect to
current officers and directors as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(b) Each Company Indemnified Agent under this _Section 6.6_ will,
promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action or
other proceeding against such Company Indemnified Agent in respect of which
indemnity may be sought from a DandO Indemnifying Party under this _Section
6.6_ , notify the DandO Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement
thereof. The omission of any Company Indemnified Agent to notify a DandO
Indemnifying Party of any such action shall not relieve such DandO
Indemnifying Party from any Liability which it may have to such Company
Indemnified Agent other than pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ , unless, and
only to the extent that, such omission actually and materially prejudices the
DandO Indemnifying Party. In case any such action or other proceeding shall be
brought against any Company Indemnified Agent and it shall notify the DandO
Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the DandO Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish,
to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Company Indemnified Agent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Company
Indemnified Agent may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to
participate in such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any action or
proceeding in which both the DandO Indemnifying Party and a Company
Indemnified Agent are, or are reasonably likely to become, a party, such
Company Indemnified Agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel at
the DandO Indemnifying Party's expense and to control its own defense of such
action or proceeding if, in the reasonable written opinion of counsel to such
Company Indemnified Agent, (i) there are or may be legal defenses
available to such Company Indemnified Agent or to other Company Indemnified
Agents that are different from or additional to those available to the DandO
Indemnifying Party or (ii) any conflict or potential conflict exists between
the DandO Indemnifying Party and such Company Indemnified Agent that would make
such separate representation advisable. The DandO Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the consent of the Company Indemnified Agent, consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Company Indemnified Agent of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation or which requires action by the Company Indemnified Agent.
The rights accorded to Company Indemnified Agents hereunder shall be in
addition to any rights that any Company Indemnified Agent may have at common
law, by separate agreement set forth in _Schedule 6.6(b)_ or otherwise.

  



  

(c) The Parent shall obtain, effective as of the Closing Date, a
binding commitment for six year "tail" insurance policies (the " _D andO Tail
Policy_") with respect to directors' and officers' liability type (either
through its existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policies or
under the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies, in which event the Company will designate Parent's insurance broker
as the Company's broker-of-record, as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion) and with the account coverage no less favorable than those of the
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained as of the date hereof
by the Acquired Companies, with respect to actions and omissions occurring
prior to the Closing Date; provided that the Parent shall not be obligated to
make aggregate annual premium payments for such six (6)-year period in
respect of such policy which exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual premium payments on Seller's current policy in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. Such insurance
shall be effective as of the Closing. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to pay any applicable premiums for such
insurance. The Parent shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies, to
maintain the DandO Tail Policy in full force and effect, for its full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by each Acquired Company, as
applicable, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for such insurance pursuant to this _Section 6.6(c)_. Copies of the DandO
Tail Policy shall be made available to Parent prior to the Closing Date.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ shall survive the Closing
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Agent, his or her heirs and his or her representatives.

  



  

(e) In the event that Parent, the Company or the Acquired
Subsidiaries, or any respective successor or assigns: (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any such
person, then, and in either case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Parent, the Company, and the Acquired
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.6_.

  



  

Section 6.7. _Merger Consideration Allocation_. For all Tax
purposes, the parties shall allocate all of the consideration to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.8 in the manner set forth in the Final Schedule 2.8(c)
to the disposition by the Company Equityholders, and the acquisition by
Parent, of the Shares and shall not allocate any such consideration to any
other agreements or obligations. Any payments made under _Article VIII_ shall
be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price for
the Shares.

  



  

Section 6.8. _Resignations_. The Company shall procure letters of
resignation to be effective at the Effective Time from those directors of the
Company and any other Acquired Company set forth in _Schedule 7.2(c)_ by
written notice delivered to the Company at least five Business Days prior to
Closing.

  



  

Section 6.9. _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent, the Acquired Companies and the Stockholder
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
pursuant hereto. Parent, the Acquired Companies and the Stockholder
Representative agree to retain all books and records within their possession
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and to the extent of any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, to make any such books and records available
to the other party prior to disposing of them and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

  



    

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and shall cause to be timely filed, all Acquired Company Tax Returns
that are due after the Closing Date which have not been filed as of the
Closing Date. Any net operating loss or Tax credit shall be carried back to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, and no election will be made for such
net operating losses or Tax credits to only be carried forward unless
otherwise requested by the Stockholder Representative. The party preparing
each such Tax Return shall consult with the Stockholder Representative
concerning such Tax Return and report all items with respect to any taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing Date in accordance with the
instructions of the Stockholder Representative. The party preparing each such
Tax Return shall provide the Stockholder Representative with a copy of such
proposed Tax Return (and such additional information regarding such Tax Return
as may reasonably be requested by the Stockholder Representative) at least 45
days prior to the filing of such Tax Return, except that in the case of a Tax
Return related to income Taxes due within 90 days following the Closing Date,
the copy shall be provided to the Stockholder Representative no less than 45
days prior to the filing. Parent shall accept any such comments to the extent
they are reasonable, provided such comment does not have the effect of
increasing any Tax liability or decreasing any Tax attribute for a Tax
Period ending after the Closing Date. Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute
regarding the preparation of Tax Returns related to income Taxes after the
Closing Date for Tax periods beginning before the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Parent shall not, without the Stockholder Representative's
advance written consent, cause any Acquired Company to take any action in
respect of any taxable period or portion thereof that ends on or before the
Closing Date that would increase any liability for any Tax of any Acquired
Company that would cause any Company Equityholder to incur any liability in
respect of that Tax. The Company Equityholders shall be entitled, in
proportion to their Pro Rata Portion, to retain, or receive immediate payment
from Parent of, any Tax Benefit (including refunds and credits arising by
reason of amended Acquired Company Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date
or otherwise) to which the Acquired Companies become entitled, with respect to
any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date relating to any Acquired
Company. With respect to any Straddle Period of any Acquired Company, Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall equitably apportion any refund or
credit of any Tax.

  



  

(d) After the Closing Date, Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) will not, without the prior written consent of
the Stockholder Representative, agree to the waiver or any extension of the
statute of limitations relating to any Taxes of the Acquired Companies for
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle
Period.

  



  

(e) Any income Taxes for a Straddle Period with respect to the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company shall be apportioned
between the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
of the period commencing on the day immediately following the Closing Date,
based on the actual operations of the Surviving Corporation, or the applicable
Acquired Company, as the case may be, during such portions of the periods,
and each such portion of such period shall be deemed to be a taxable period
(whether or not it is in fact a taxable period). For purposes of computing
the income Taxes attributable to the two portions of a Straddle Period, any
Tax based directly or indirectly on gross or net income or receipts or imposed
in respect of specific transactions, and any credits available with respect
to any Tax, shall be allocated by assuming that the taxable period ended on
the Closing Date, and any other Tax shall be allocated based on the number of
days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date divided by the total
number of days in the taxable period.

  



  

(f) At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due, all
gross receipts, transfer Taxes, gains Taxes, real property transfer
Taxes, sales Taxes, use Taxes, excise Taxes, stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes
and any other similar Taxes applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the
Transactions shall be paid by Parent. Parent shall prepare any Tax Returns
with respect to such Taxes, and the Stockholder Representative shall
cooperate with Parent in the preparation of such Tax Returns.

  



    

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) To the extent applicable, the Acquired Companies shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to the
initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under _Section
6.9(h)_ , a parachute payment waiver, from each person who the Acquired
Companies reasonably believe is, with respect to the Acquired Companies, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately before
the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under _Section
6.9(h)_ and who would otherwise reasonably be expected to have, receive or
have the right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section
280G of the Code as a result of the Transactions, pursuant to which such
person shall agree to waive any and all right or entitlement to the parachute
payments (collectively, the " _Payments_ ") to the extent the value thereof
exceeds 2.99 times such person's base amount determined in accordance with
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, unless
the requisite stockholder approval of the Payments is obtained pursuant to
_Section 6.9(h)_.

  



  

(h) The Acquired Companies shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the approval by such number of stockholders of the Acquired
Companies as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so
as to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code
inapplicable to any and all Payments, with such stockholder vote to be
obtained in a manner which satisfied all applicable requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

Section 6.10. _Notice of Developments_. From the date hereof until
the Closing Date, the Company shall disclose to Parent and Merger Subsidiary
in writing any material variances from the representations and warranties
contained in _Article III_ , and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall promptly
notify the Company if Parent or Merger Subsidiary obtain knowledge that any
representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement or the attached
Company Disclosure Schedules is not true and correct in all material
respects, or if Parent or Merger Subsidiary obtains knowledge of any material
errors in, or omissions from, any Schedule to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.11. _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the sooner of
the Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms and subject to the exercise of the Company's board of
directors' fiduciary duties and applicable Law, neither the Stockholder
Representative nor the Company will, directly or indirectly, through any
officer, director, employee, agent (including financial advisors), partner or
otherwise, continue, solicit, entertain, initiate, facilitate or participate
in or encourage discussions or negotiations with, or the submission of bids,
offers or proposals by, any Person with respect to, whether directly or
indirectly, an acquisition of any Acquired Company, or any acquisition of any
capital stock or other equity or other interest of or in any Acquired Company
or any material assets of any Acquired Company, by any means whatsoever, or
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding any of the
foregoing. The Company and the Stockholder Representative will immediately
cease and terminate any discussions or negotiations with any third party that
are ongoing with respect to any transaction of the type or similar to those
described in the immediately preceding sentence. In addition, from the date
hereof until the Effective Time, except as required by applicable Law and the
exercise of the Company's board of directors' fiduciary duties, neither the
Stockholder Representative nor any Acquired Company will, directly or
indirectly, through any Representative or otherwise, disclose any
information not customarily disclosed to any Person (other than Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and their Representatives) in the Company's Ordinary Course
of Business or afford to any such other Person access to the Acquired
Companies' properties, books or records without the prior written consent of
Parent. Furthermore, if the Company or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents (including financial advisors) or partners receives any
written communication regarding the submission of bids, offers or
proposals by, any Person with respect to, whether directly or indirectly, an
acquisition of any Acquired Company, or any acquisition of any capital stock
or other equity or other interest of or in any Acquired Company or any
material assets of any Acquired Company, by any means whatsoever, between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, then the Company shall immediately notify
Parent of the receipt of such bid, offer or proposal. The Company shall give
Parent prompt (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) notice
(which notice may be oral, and, if oral, shall be subsequently confirmed in
writing) (x) of receipt of any such bid, offer or proposal by the Company or
any of its or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents (including
financial advisors) or partners (which notice shall include the identity of
such person or group and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers, including, if applicable, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and (y) of the
Company's furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such person or group, and shall receive from such Person
an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to
the Company than the terms of the confidentiality agreement entered into
between the Company and Parent dated as of July 27, 2017 prior to furnishing
nonpublic information regarding the Company to, or enter into a
confidentiality agreement or discussions or negotiations with, any Person in
response to a bona fide, unsolicited written bid, offer or proposal submitted
by such Person.

this Agreement and proceed with the Transactions. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary further acknowledge and agree: (i) that materials they have
received from the Company Equityholders, the Acquired Companies and their
agents and representatives, including the Broker, include projections,
forecasts and predictions relating to the Acquired Companies' business; (ii)
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such

(b) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that they (i)

(a) Parent will cause the Acquired Companies to continue the
employment effective immediately after the Closing Date of all Company
Employees, including each on medical, disability, family or other leave of
absence as of the Closing Date. All such Company Employees who remain
employed by the Acquired Companies immediately following the Closing Date are
referred to as " _Retained Employees_." For a period of at least one year
following the Closing Date, Parent will cause the Acquired Companies to
provide each such Retained Employee who remains employed with at least the
same base wages, annual base salary and annual rate of cash bonus opportunity
(determined as a percentage of annual base salary) (but excluding any equity
plan program or arrangement) provided to each such employee on the Closing
Date. Nothing in this _Section 6.13_ shall obligate Parent or the Acquired
Companies to continue the employment of any such Retained Employee for any
specific period.

  



  

(b) As of the Closing Date and for a period of not less than one
year thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Acquired
Companies to provide, each Retained Employee with employee benefits (other
than any equity based compensation) that are comparable in the aggregate to
the employee benefits provided to such Retained Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date whether under the Employee Benefit Plans or otherwise.

  



    

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) give,
or cause the Acquired Companies to give, each Retained Employee credit for
the Retained Employee's service with the Acquired Companies prior to the
Closing Date (including for purposes of any vacation, sick leave, and
severance policies) under any employee benefit plan or personnel policies that
cover the Retained Employee after the Closing Date, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance
benefits only; (ii) allow each Retained Employee to participate in each plan
providing welfare benefits (including medical, life insurance, long term
disability insurance and long term care insurance) after the Closing without
regard to preexisting condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of
insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained
Employee by the corresponding Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing Date; and (iii) if any of the Employee Benefit Plans are terminated
prior to the end of the plan year that includes the Closing Date, credit the
Retained Employee with any expenses that were covered by the Employee Benefit
Plans for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable
limits under any similar replacement plans.

  



  

(d) Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies to continue to credit
to each Retained Employee all accrued vacation and personal holiday pay that
the Retained Employee is entitled to but has not used as of the Closing Date
(including any earned vacation or personal holiday pay to be used in future
years), and shall assume all liability and/or obligation for the payment of
such amounts subject to the terms of Parent's vacation and sick leave
policies.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall take all
appropriate action to terminate any Employee Benefit Plan that the
Parent directs the Acquired Companies to terminate prior to the Closing. The
Acquired Companies agree to provide the Parent with copies of all required
resolutions and related documents to effect such terminations in advance of
such action and to permit the Parent to propose such changes and revisions as
the Parent reasonably believes are appropriate and to approve such resolutions
and related documents.

  



  

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.13_ are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant, or any other individual associated therewith, shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.13_.
In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish,
amend or modify any Employee Benefit Plan or any other "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the Acquired
Companies, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or
terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer
upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant,
any right to employment or continued employment or continued service with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, distributions from the Navitas
Credit Corp. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust will be made as soon
as administratively practicable following the Closing, regardless of whether
a determination letter application is filed by any party with respect to the
qualified status of such plan.

Section 6.14. _Retention and Access to Records_. The Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to retain copies of all books and records
of the Acquired Companies relating to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. For a period of seven years following the Closing Date, Parent
shall maintain all books and records of the Acquired Companies relating to
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and shall make them, and any
individuals responsible for maintenance of such books and records, available
to the Stockholder Representative upon reasonable notice during normal
business hours. If at any time after the Closing, the Stockholder
Representative requires a copy of any such book or record, it shall have the
right to promptly obtain a copy thereof from Parent at Parent's cost.

  



  

Section 6.15. _Contact with Business Relations_. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary are not authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of
their employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any officer
(other than Gary Shivers and Richard Pfaltzgraff), director, employee,
customer, supplier, distributor, vendor or other material business relation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing without the prior
written consent and coordination of the Broker (not to be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld).

  



  

Section 6.16. _Supplemental Information_. The Company may, from time
to time prior to or at the Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, supplement or amend any Company Disclosure Schedule or add a
new Company Disclosure Schedule with a corresponding reference to be added to
this Agreement (each, a " _Supplement_ "), including one or more Supplements
to correct any matter which may constitute a breach of any representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant contained herein. If Parent does not provide
a written termination notice pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
10.1(e)_ within five (5) Business Days after receiving any Supplement which
discloses any event, fact or circumstance that has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, Parent shall be
deemed to have waived for all purposes of this Agreement all rights and
remedies (including its right to not consummate the Merger due to the failure
of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2) hereunder or under
applicable Law.

  



  

Section 6.17. _R andW Insurance_. The parties hereto acknowledge that,
as of the date hereof, the Parent has obtained a binder to the RandW Insurance
Policy, attached hereto as _Exhibit E-1_ , and that a true and correct copy of
such conditional binder has been provided to the Company. Prior to the
Closing, the Parent shall take all action necessary to obtain and bind, and
shall obtain and bind, the RandW Insurance Policy, which shall contain the same
terms and conditions as set forth in _Exhibit E-2_ , except as consented to
by the Company in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld);
provided, that, in all events, the RandW Insurance Policy shall provide that
(i) the insurer shall have no, and shall waive and not pursue any and all
subrogation rights against the Company Equityholders except for Fraud; (ii)
the Company Equityholders are intended third party beneficiaries of such
waiver; and (iii) following the Closing, Parent shall not amend the RandW
Insurance Policy in any manner adverse to the Company Equityholders
(including with respect to the subrogation provisions or the exclusion
provisions) without the Stockholder Representative's express prior written
consent. The RandW Insurance Policy has been issued for the benefit of the
Purchaser Indemnitees and customized based on the applicable survival periods,
caps and deductibles set forth in _Article VIII_. Prior to the Closing, the
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid, all costs and expenses related to the
RandW Insurance Policy, including the total premium, underwriting costs,
brokerage commission for both the Company's and the Parent's respective
brokers, taxes related to such policy and other fees and expenses of such
policy.

insurers, directors, officers, stockholders, employees and agents (also, the
" _Company Releasees_ ") forever irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
releases each of their respective directors, officers, stockholders, employees
and agents (the " _Representative Releasees_ ") from any and all Company
Released Claims (as defined below), known or unknown, existing or claimed to
exist, fixed or contingent that have been or might have been asserted prior
to the Effective Time under any foreign, federal, state, local or common law,
directly or indirectly, which such Company Releasee ever had or may have prior

director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder of the Company or any
Acquired Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) such Representative
Releasee's participation in the operation of the business of the Company or

not release any Representative Releasee or any other Person from any
obligation of such Representative Releasee or other Person under any
provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document, whether arising
before or after the Effective Time, including, without limitation, the
indemnification obligations set forth in _Article VIII_ of this Agreement. 

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.18_ shall survive the Closing
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Releasee, Representative Releasee, and each of their respective
personal representatives, legal representatives, heirs, successors and
permitted assigns.

  



  

Section 6.19. _Registration and Listing of UCBI Stock._ 

  



  

(a) The UCBI Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration shall not
have been registered and shall be characterized as "restricted
securities" under applicable federal and state securities laws, and under
such laws such shares may be resold without registration under the 1933 Act,
only in certain limited circumstances. Each certificate or book-entry
allocation evidencing UCBI Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration shall
bear an appropriate restrictive legend or stop transfer instructions with
respect thereto in substantially the following form:

  



    

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND
MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT
WHILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATING THERETO IS IN EFFECT UNDER SUCH ACT
AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS.

  



  

(b)

  



  

(i) UCBI agrees to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") on the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter but not later than five (5) Business Days an automatic shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _1933 Act_ "), which provides for the resale of UCBI Stock
held by the Company Equityholders as selling securityholders. The UCBI
Registration Statement, any post-effective amendment thereto, the base
prospectus included in the UCBI Registration Statement (the " _Base
Prospectus_ ") and any prospectus supplement relating to the transfer or sale
of the Stock Consideration filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the 1933 Act (the " _Prospectus Supplement_ " and together with the Base
Prospectus, the " _Prospectus_ ", each as they may be amended or supplemented
from time to time), together with the exhibits thereto and the documents
incorporated by reference therein, are hereinafter collectively referred to as
the " _UCBI Registration Statement_." UCBI agrees to take any action required
to be taken under the applicable state securities laws in connection with the
resale of shares of the Stock Consideration. The Company agrees to provide
UCBI reasonable assistance as necessary in the preparation of the UCBI
Registration Statement, including, without limitation, providing UCBI with
all material facts regarding the operations, business, assets, liabilities and
personnel of the Company, together with the audited financial statements of
the Company, all as and to the extent required by the 1933 Act and the rules,
regulations and practices of the SEC, for inclusion in the UCBI Registration
Statement or any other offering or financing document prepared by UCBI in
connection with this transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by Company or any Acquired Company with
respect to statements made or information provided or incorporated by
reference in the UCBI Registration Statement; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not limit or otherwise qualify the representations and
warranties given by Company to UCBI set forth in _Article III_ as
qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedules. In lieu of the foregoing, UCBI
shall be permitted at its discretion to file the Prospectus Supplements under
an existing automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 previously
filed under the 1933 Act to provide for the resale of UCBI Stock held by the
Company Equityholders as selling securityholders.

  



  

(ii) UCBI hereby agrees that it will have as of the Closing Date and
at all times prior to the termination of the Registration Period, other than
during a Suspension Period (as defined below) permitted by _Section 6.20_ , an
effective UCBI Registration Statement permitting the transfer or sale of the
Stock Consideration. UCBI shall notify each Company Equityholder of any stop
order issued or threatened to be issued by the SEC in connection with the
UCBI Registration Statement and take all reasonable actions required to
prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.

  



    

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) UCBI agrees:

  



  

(i) that the UCBI Registration Statement conforms and, at any time
that the UCBI Registration Statement is available for use in connection with
the transfer or resale of the Stock Consideration will conform, in all
material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except during any Suspension Period permitted by
_Section 6.20;_

  



  

(ii) that the UCBI Registration Statement does not contain and at
any time that the UCBI Registration Statement is available for use in
connection with the transfer or resale of the Stock Consideration will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading, except
during any Suspension Period permitted by  _Section 6.20_ ; _provided_ , that
no representation or warranty is made as to information contained in or
omitted from the UCBI Registration Statement in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information relating to the Company furnished to UCBI
by the Company or any representatives on behalf of the Company expressly for
use in the UCBI Registration Statement;

  



  

(iii) that the Prospectus, at any time that such Prospectus is
available for use in connection with the transfer or resale of the Stock
Consideration, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of
the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except during any Suspension
Period permitted by _Section 6.20_ ; _provided_ , that no representation or
warranty is made as to information contained in or omitted from such
Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
relating to the Company furnished to UCBI by the Company or any
representatives on behalf of the Company expressly for use in such
Prospectus;

  



  

(iv) and to list on the Nasdaq, by the date on which the UCBI
Registration Statement (or, as applicable, the Prospectus Supplement) is
filed, all of the shares of Stock Consideration; and

  



  

(v) to remove the restrictive legend set forth on the certificates
representing the Stock Consideration and issue a certificate without such
restrictive legend to the holder of the applicable certificate upon which it
is stamped or issue to such holder by electronic delivery at the applicable
balance account at the Depository Trust Company at such time as (i) such UCBI
Stock is registered for resale under the 1933 Act, (ii) such UCBI Stock is
sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 (if the transferor is not an
Affiliate of UCBI), and (iii) such UCBI Stock is eligible for sale under Rule
144, without the requirement for UCBI to be in compliance with the current
public information required under Rule 144 as to such securities and without
volume or manner-of-sale restrictions. Upon the filing of the UCBI
Registration Statement with the SEC UCBI shall cause its counsel to issue,
effective upon the filing of the UCBI Registration Statement with the SEC, a
blanket legend removal opinion as required by the transfer agent removing
the legend on all UCBI Stock upon resale of such shares at all times during
the Registration Period. Following the earlier of (1) the sale of the UCBI
Stock pursuant to Rule 144 or (2) Rule 144 becoming available for the resale
of the UCBI Stock, without the requirement for UCBI to be in compliance with
the current public information required under Rule 144 as to the UCBI Stock
and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, UCBI shall instruct its
transfer agent to remove the restrictive legend from the UCBI Stock and shall
cause its counsel to issue any legend removal opinion required by the transfer
agent. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the parties that
the UCBI Stock registered under the UCBI Registration Statement be freely
tradeable without restriction during the Registration Period and thereafter
pursuant to Rule 144.

Section 6.20. _Prospectus Supplement._

  



  

(a) UCBI agrees to provide each Company Equityholder with a copy of
a seller questionnaire (the " _Seller Questionnaire_ ") within five (5)
Business Days of the date hereof, to the extent not provided prior to the
date hereof. UCBI covenants and agrees to prepare and file with the SEC the
Prospectus Supplement registering the transfer and/or resale of the Stock
Consideration within five (5) Business Days after receipt of fully completed
Seller Questionnaires from a majority of the Company Equityholders. During
the Registration Period, UCBI will thereafter file an additional prospectus
supplement once every thirty (30) calendar days for sixty (60) consecutive
days registering the transfer and/or resale of that portion of the Stock
Consideration covered by additional Seller Questionnaires delivered
by Company Equityholders. From the end of the sixty (60) day period and
thereafter, within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of additional Seller
Questionnaires, UCBI shall file a prospectus supplement registering the
transfer and/or resale of that portion of the Stock Consideration covered by
such Seller Questionnaires. UCBI further agrees to file promptly with the
SEC any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus that may, in the judgment
of UCBI and the Company Equityholders, be required by the 1933 Act or
requested by the SEC. During the Registration Period, UCBI agrees to advise
each Company Equityholder, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto is filed and
to promptly deliver such number of Prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto as the Company Equityholders may reasonably request.

  



  

(b) UCBI covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
keep the UCBI Registration Statement continuously effective until the earlier
of (i) the resale of all shares of the Stock Consideration or (ii) the twelve
month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Registration Period_ "). UCBI
may suspend the effectiveness of the UCBI Registration Statement and the use
of any Prospectus included therein in the event, and for such period of time
as (i) such a suspension is required by the rules and regulations of the SEC
as applied to UCBI, (ii) such Prospectus Supplement ceases to meet the
requirements of Section 10 of the 1933 Act or (iii) in the good faith
determination by UCBI's board of directors, offers and sales pursuant to the
UCBI Registration Statement should not be made by reason of the existence of
material undisclosed circumstances or developments with respect to which the
disclosure that would be required in the UCBI Registration Statement would be
premature and would have an adverse effect on UCBI (each a " _Suspension
Event_ " and the period during which the Suspension Event continues to be
true, a " _Suspension Period_ "). UCBI will promptly advise each Company
Equityholder of any Suspension Event, and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Suspension Period to terminate at the
earliest possible date; _provided_ , that UCBI may not initially suspend the
effectiveness of the UCBI Registration Statement for a period of more than 30
days; _provided_ that UCBI may not commence a new Suspension Period within 20
Business Days of the expiration of the preceding Suspension Period. Following
receipt of any such notice, and until such Suspension Period is
terminated, the Company Equityholders will not make use of the Prospectus and
will not make any sales requiring delivery of such Prospectus. UCBI also
agrees to notify each Company Equityholder promptly of the happening of any
event as a result of which the UCBI Registration Statement, as then in
effect, or any Prospectus would contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein (in the case of a Prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made), not misleading, and agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly update and/or correct such UCBI
Registration Statement and Prospectus.

  



  

(c) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, if at the
time of any post-effective amendment to the UCBI Registration
Statement, including by way of a Section 10(a)(3) amendment, UCBI is not a
"well-known seasoned issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act) or
is an "ineligible issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act), or is
otherwise not permitted to utilize an automatic shelf registration statement
under the 1933 Act, UCBI shall promptly, and in no event later than fifteen
(15) Business Days after being unable to use an automatic shelf registration
statement, file a registration statement on Form S-3, or any other
appropriate form, registering the transfer and or resale of the Stock
Consideration and the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
_Section 6.19_ and this _Section 6.20_ regarding the UCBI Registration
Statement and any Prospectus shall apply to such new registration statement
and prospectus. UCBI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause that
registration statement to become effective as promptly as possible.

  



    

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) UCBI shall file on a timely basis all reports required to be
filed by it under the Exchange Act. If UCBI is not required to file
reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, upon the request of any Company
Equityholder, UCBI shall make publicly available the information specified in
subparagraph (c)(2) of SEC Rule 144. UCBI shall take such further action as
may be reasonably required from time to time and as may be within the
reasonable control of UCBI, to enable the Company Equityholders to transfer
the Stock Consideration without registration under the 1933 Act within the
limitation of the exemptions provided by SEC Rule 144 or any similar rule
or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of any Company
Equityholder, UCBI will deliver to such Company Equityholder a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not,
the specifics thereof. In connection with the sale, transfer or disposition
of any shares of Stock Consideration by any Company Equityholder pursuant to
the UCBI Registration Statement or under SEC Rule 144, UCBI agrees promptly
to cause its transfer agent to remove the restrictive legend on
certificates or book entries representing shares of Stock Consideration sold,
transferred or distributed to the transferees and if necessary to instruct
UCBI's counsel to promptly issue an opinion, at UCBI's expense, confirming to
the transfer agent the right to have such legend removed. In connection with
any sale, transfer or other disposition by a Company Equityholder of any
shares of Stock Consideration pursuant to SEC Rule 144, UCBI shall cooperate
with such holder to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates representing shares of such Stock Consideration to be sold and
not bearing any 1933 Act legend, and enable certificates for such shares of
Stock Consideration to be for such number of shares and registered in such
names as the Company Equityholder may reasonably request.

except to the extent that the Responsible Party is actually prejudiced
thereby. The Responsible Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
such notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party and at the expense of the Responsible
Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Responsible Party in connection therewith (it being
acknowledged and agreed that upon such assumption of conduct and control, the
Responsible Party, and not the Indemnified Party, shall have the exclusive
right to settle and defend such Proceeding); _provided_ that the Responsible
Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party). So long
as the Responsible Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good
faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. If the
Responsible Party elects to conduct the defense and settlement of a Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle
such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that in such event it shall waive any
right to indemnity by the Responsible Party for all Losses related to such
claim unless the Responsible Party shall have consented to such payment or
settlement. If the Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's Notice
of Claim hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise
the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor
pursuant to this Agreement. The Responsible Party shall not, except with the
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), enter into any settlement that does not include as a term thereof
the giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties
of a release from all liability with respect to such claim or consent to
entry of any judgment. The Indemnified Party shall in no event settle (or
consent to the settlement of) any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Responsible Party. Any non-compliance by the Indemnified Party
with the terms and conditions of this _Section 8.3_ shall be deemed a waiver
of such Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder and
shall unconditionally absolve the Responsible Party of any obligation to
provide any indemnification hereunder in respect of any Losses related to or
arising out of or in connection with such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(b) All of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation (or a duly
authorized representative of such party) shall (and shall cause the Company
to) furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 8.4. _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the rights of the
Purchaser Indemnitees to any indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2_ are
subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(a) Except with respect to (i) claims for Fraud, and (ii) breaches
of Fundamental Representations made by the Company, the aggregate amount of
Losses for which the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification by the Company Equityholders pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_
and _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ will not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount;

  



  

(b) the amount of any and all Losses pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_
shall be determined net of any amounts actually recovered by the Purchaser
Indemnitees under insurance policies or other collateral sources (such as
contractual indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this
Agreement) with respect to such Losses (after deducting therefrom the sum of
the increase of any insurance premiums incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee
as a result of its recovery under any insurance policy) and the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall be required to use commercially reasonable
efforts to timely pursue such recovery;

  



  

(c) the aggregate amount required to be paid by the Company
Equityholders under _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ shall in no event exceed the amount
of Gross Merger Consideration actually received by each Company Equityholder;

  



  

(d) the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as
applicable, shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ , or _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ , other
than with respect to claims for Fraud or resulting from or relating to a
breach of any of the Fundamental Representations, until the total amount which
the Purchaser Indemnitees would recover under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ and
_Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ or the Seller Indemnitees would recover under
_Section 8.2(b)(i)_ , as applicable, (as limited by the provisions of this
_Article VIII_ and _11.14_ ), is an amount equal to one-half of one percent
(0.50%) of the Gross Merger Consideration (the " _Threshold_ "), in which case
the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, shall
only be entitled to recover all Losses in excess of the Threshold;

  



    

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) except with respect to claims arising from Fraud or breaches of
the Fundamental Representations, the Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining at any
given time in the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be the sole source of
recovery, and in no event shall the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to
recover more than the amount of the funds available in the Indemnity Escrow
Account pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_  and _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ in the
aggregate;

  



  

(f) breaches of the Fundamental Representations made by the Company
shall be satisfied: (i) first, from the Indemnity Escrow Account; (ii)
second, by submission of claims by Parent pursuant to the RandW Insurance
Policy until such time as the policy limit set forth in the RandW Insurance
Policy has been reached; and (iii) thereafter, if the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses for breaches of the Fundamental Representations made by
the Company exceeds the policy limit set forth in the RandW Insurance Policy,
then, against the Company Equityholders (solely to the extent of such excess)
and subject to each of the limitations set forth in this Article VIII;
provided that the aggregate amount required to be paid by the Company
Equityholders under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ for
breaches of Fundamental Representations shall in no event exceed the amount of
Gross Merger Consideration actually received by each Company Equityholder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 8.4_ , to
the extent Parent is unable to recover Losses under the RandW Insurance Policy
because (x) the policy limit under the RandW Insurance Policy has been met, and
(y) a portion of Losses previously recovered under the RandW Insurance Policy
related to breaches of the Fundamental Representations, then: (1) the total
aggregate amount of the liability of the Company Equityholders for
Losses with respect to any subsequent claims for breaches of any Fundamental
Representations made by the Company shall be increased by an amount (the "
_Additional Cap Amount_ ") equal to the amount of Losses previously recovered
by Parent under the RandW Insurance Policy related to breaches of the
Fundamental Representations; and (2) the total aggregate amount of the
liability of the Company Equityholders for Losses with respect to any claims
made pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_  (excluding
Fundamental Representations) shall be increased by an amount equal to the
lesser of (A) the Additional Cap Amount, and (B) that portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount that was previously used to satisfy Losses for
breaches of any Fundamental Representations, and Parent shall be entitled to
seek indemnification under this _Article 8_ for Losses up to such amounts, as
applicable, directly from the Company Equityholders. For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section 8.4(f)_ does not increase the survival periods in
_Section 8.1_.

  



  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict or limit any
general obligation at Law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any
Losses which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by a Responsible
Party of any representation or warranty or the breach of any covenant of the
Responsible Party hereunder;

  



  

(h) Parent, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser Indemnitee,
further acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of _Section 8.4(e)_
 shall apply regardless of whether (i) Parent obtains at or following Closing
or maintains following Closing the RandW Insurance Policy, (ii) the RandW
Insurance Policy expires, is revoked, cancelled or modified in any manner
after issuance, or (iii) any Purchaser Indemnitee makes a claim under the RandW
Insurance Policy and such claim is denied by the insurer under such
RandW Insurance Policy;

  



  

(i) in no event shall any Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to seek
or receive indemnification for the same Loss more than once under this
_Article VIII_ even if a claim for indemnification in respect of such Loss has
been made as a result of a breach of more than one (1) representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;

  



    

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(j) in no event shall any Purchaser Indemnitee be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ with respect to a
specific Loss to the extent such Loss is (i) clearly and separately reserved
for on the face of the Balance Sheet Date or in the footnotes to any other
Financial Statements, (ii) is included in the calculation of the Gross Merger
Consideration, including any such Loss that is related to any reserve or
other similar item included in such calculation, or (iii) consisting of or
relating to Taxes with respect to any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period following the Closing Date as a result of any breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.8_ ;

  



  

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, after the Closing,
and except with respect to claims arising from Fraud or breaches of the
Fundamental Representations, on the date that the Indemnity Escrow Amount is
reduced to zero, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have no further rights to
indemnification from any Person or otherwise under or pursuant to this
Agreement. In any case where a Purchaser Indemnitee recovers, under
insurance policies or from other collateral sources, any amount, or realizes
any Tax Benefit not previously taken into account, in respect of a matter for
which such Purchaser Indemnitee was indemnified pursuant to _Section 8.2_ ,
such Purchaser Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to the Exchange Agent (on
behalf of, and for further distribution to, the Company Equityholders) the
amount so recovered or realized (after deducting therefrom the amount of the
expenses incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee in procuring such recovery or
realization), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so
paid to or on behalf of such Purchaser Indemnitee in respect of such matter
and (ii) any amount expended by the Company Equityholders in pursuing or
defending any claim arising out of such matter.

  



  

Section 8.5. _Subrogation_. If a Responsible Party makes an
indemnification payment to an Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss, then
such Responsible Party will be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to
all related rights and remedies of such Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy, acquisition agreement or other agreement or right against or with
respect to such Loss, except with respect to amounts not yet recovered by
such Indemnified Party (or any other such Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder) under any such insurance policy, acquisition agreement or other
agreement or right that already have been netted against such Loss
for purposes of determining the indemnifiable amount of such Loss. Promptly
following such Responsible Party's request, such Indemnified Party will take
all reasonably necessary, proper or desirable actions (including the execution
and delivery of any document reasonably requested) to accomplish the
foregoing.

  



  

Section 8.6. _The Stockholder Representative_. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Stockholder Representative (in its capacity as
the Stockholder Representative) is a party to this Agreement solely to perform
certain administrative functions in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to, and
shall not be liable for any Losses of, any party hereto or to any Purchaser
Indemnitee in connection with any obligations of the Stockholder
Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any agreements
ancillary hereto, or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



    

 | 67| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 8.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything else
contained in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to _Section 11.8_ ,
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for the parties hereto for any misrepresentation or
breach of any warranty, covenant or other provision contained in
this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal, the Support Agreements, the
Option Cancellation Agreements, or in any other Transaction Document,
certificate or other instrument or document delivered pursuant hereto
(including with respect to any matters arising under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
from time to time, or any other environmental matters) or for any matter
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing herein will limit or otherwise affect any Purchaser
Indemnitee's or the Seller Indemnitee's right or ability to make, pursue,
enforce or prosecute (a) any claims based on Fraud against the person
committing the Fraud, or (b) a claim against the RandW Insurance Policy.

  



  

Section 8.8. _Direct Claims_. Any claim by a party (also, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") on account of a Loss which does not result from a
Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be asserted by the
Indemnified Party giving the party obligated to indemnify (also, a "
_Responsible Party_ ") prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Responsible Party
of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent that the Responsible
Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Responsible Party shall have 30
days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Responsible Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to
what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Responsible Party's investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to each Acquired
Company's premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Responsible Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Responsible Party does
not so respond within such 30-day period, the Responsible Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.9. _Manner of Payment; Escrow._

  



  

(a) Subject to the last paragraph of _Section 8.2_ , any
indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the applicable Persons to an account
designated in writing by the applicable Purchaser Indemnitees or Seller
Indemnitees, as the case may be, within fifteen (15) days of the Final
Determination. All such payments shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes.

  



  

(b) Any funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account as of the
Survival Period Termination Date (minus the aggregate amount claimed by the
Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to claims made against such funds, not fully
resolved prior to such date and continued to be contested in good faith by a
Purchaser Indemnitee) shall be released to the Exchange Agent (for the benefit
of, and for further distribution to, the Company Equityholders). At any time
following the Survival Period Termination Date, to the extent the funds held
in the Indemnity Escrow Account exceed the aggregate amount claimed by the
Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to claims made prior to the Survival Period
Termination Date, not fully resolved prior to the time of determination and
continued to be contested in good faith by a Purchaser Indemnitee the excess
funds shall be promptly released to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Company Equityholders.

  



  

(c) The Stockholder Representative and Parent shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make
any distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Account expressly provided herein.

  



    

 | 68| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 8.10. _Materiality Qualifiers_. For the purposes of this
_Article VIII_ , any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, as well as any Losses resulting from any
such breach or inaccuracy, shall be determined without giving effect to any
limitations or qualifications regarding materiality, the use of the word
"material", "material respects", or "Material Adverse Effect", or any similar
term, qualification or limitation based on materiality contained herein
(other than those set forth in (a) the definition of Material Contract and
Permitted Exceptions, (b) any provisions of any representation or warranty
made by the Company in this Agreement that require the Company to list
items in the Schedules, and (c) the Fundamental Representations, _Section
3.6_ , _Section 3.7(q)_ , _Section 3.8(a)_ , _Section 3.8(b)_ and _Section
3.8(d)_.)

  



  

 _Article IX

Section 9.1. _Appointment_.

  



  

(a) As provided in their Letter of Transmittal or by their execution

subject to _Sections 9.5_ and _9.6_ below;

  



    

 | 69| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) with the prior consent or approval (which such consent or
approval may be provided by electronic mail) of the Advisory Group, to
refrain from enforcing any right of any Company Equityholder and/or the
Stockholder Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating
to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or
document in connection with the foregoing; provided, however, that no such
failure to act on the part of the Stockholder Representative, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement, shall be
deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Stockholder
Representative or by such Company Equityholder unless such waiver is in
writing signed by the waiving party or by the Stockholder Representative; and

  



  

(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other
agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices,
requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other
writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all
action that the Stockholder Representative may reasonably consider necessary
or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other
agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or
executed in connection herewith and therewith.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative
shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Company Equityholders, except
as expressly provided herein, and - for purposes of clarity - it is
acknowledged and agreed there are no obligations of the Stockholder
Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule (including the Company
Disclosure Schedules), exhibit, or annex other than the Escrow Agreement and
any agreement with the Exchange Agent.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise set forth herein, the agency and proxy
provided herein are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable
without the consent of the Stockholder Representative and shall survive the
death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of each Company
Equityholder.

  



    

 | 70| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Such agency may be changed by the Advisory Group from time-to-
time upon not less than 5 days' prior written notice to Parent;  _provided_
that a Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless such removal and
the identity of the substituted agent or agents is agreed to by a majority-
in-interest of the Company Equityholders (calculated on the basis of (i) the
number of Shares and Exchanged Options held by such Company Equityholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (ii) the total number of
Shares and Exchanged Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time). The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time upon not less
than 20 days' prior written notice to Parent. A vacancy in the position of
Stockholder Representative may be filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority-in-interest of the Company Equityholders calculated as set forth in
the first sentence of this paragraph. The immunities and rights of the
Stockholder Representative to be indemnified shall survive the Closing and
any resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or any member of
the Advisory Group. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder
Representative. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder
Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Company Equityholders.

  



  

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to retain
counsel and accountants and to incur such costs and expenses (including court
costs and attorneys' fees and expenses) as the Stockholder Representative
deems in its sole discretion to be necessary or appropriate in connection
with its performance of its obligations under this Agreement, and all such
costs and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative shall be borne
by the Company Equityholders based on their Pro Rata Portion.

  



  

(f) The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely
upon the Payment Spreadsheet; (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to
be genuine; and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company Equityholder or
other party.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Article IX_ , the Stockholder Representative shall obtain the prior consent
or approval (which such consent or approval may be provided by electronic
mail) of the Advisory Group, prior to taking any action that is material to
any of the Company Equityholders.

  



  

Section 9.2. _Recovery Rights_. The Stockholder Representative
shall have the right to recover from, at its sole discretion, the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund, prior to any distribution to the Company
Equityholders, the Stockholder Representative's reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in serving in that capacity and any costs and expenses
incurred by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this _Article IX_ (the
" _Charges_ "). If the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund is
insufficient to satisfy the Charges, all Charges shall be borne by the Company
Equityholders based on their Pro Rata Portion, which shall be paid within
five Business Days of written request thereof by the Stockholder
Representative.

  



  

Section 9.3. _Binding Authority_. Provided that the Stockholder
Representative has received any applicable prior consent or approval of the
Advisory Group as explicitly required in _Section 9.1_ , a decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision
of the Company Equityholders and shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon
the Company Equityholders and their successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing; and Parent may conclusively and absolutely rely, without
any inquiry, upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent, or instruction
of the Company Equityholders. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to
any Person, including any Company Equityholders, for any acts done by it in
accordance with or reliance on such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Representative. All defenses which may be available to any
Company Equityholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the
Stockholder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement are
waived. Notwithstanding anything herein, any requirements to receive consent
from the Advisory Group hereunder shall be conditioned upon the timely
response (at the discretion of the Stockholder Representative) of the
Advisory Group and it is hereby acknowledged that in the absence of timely
directives from the Advisory Group, the Stockholder Representative shall act
in the best interests of the Company Equityholders.

  



    

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 9.4. _Agent_. All notices or other communications required
to be made or delivered by Parent to the Company Equityholders shall be made
to the Stockholder Representative for the benefit of the Company
Equityholders and any notices so made shall discharge in full all
notice requirements of Parent to the Company Equityholders with respect
thereto. All notices or other communications required to be made or delivered
by any Company Equityholders to Parent shall be made by the Stockholder
Representative for the benefit of the Company Equityholders and any notices
so made shall discharge in full all notice requirements of such Company
Equityholder to Parent with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 9.5. _Indemnification of Stockholder Representative_. By
virtue of their acceptance of any portion of the Gross Merger Consideration,
the Company Equityholders hereby agree severally to indemnify the Stockholder
Representative according to their Pro Rata Portion against, and to hold the
Stockholder Representative harmless from, and waive, any and all
Liabilities, obligations, Losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, amounts paid in settlement, costs, expenses (including costs of
counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking
recovery from insurers) or disbursements of whatever kind (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Stockholder Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the actual fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the
Company Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to
the extent attributable to such fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or
intentional misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative
by the Company Equityholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered
by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund, (ii) the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account
at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Company Equityholders; provided, that while this section allows the
Stockholder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the Company Equityholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Company
Equityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification
obligations of the Company Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, including _Section 11.7_ hereof, are not intended to be applicable
to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder Representative under this
_Section 9.5_. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the termination
of this Agreement.. The Company Equityholders acknowledge that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties, or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Stockholder Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Stockholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Stockholder Representative in performing such actions.

Section 9.6. _Waiver_. Certain Company Equityholders have entered
into an engagement agreement (the " _Stockholder Representative Engagement
Agreement_ ") with the Stockholder Representative to provide direction to the
Stockholder Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement and the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement (such
Company Equityholders, including their representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Stockholder
Representative nor any of its Non-Recourse Parties or any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Stockholder Representative Group_
") shall incur any Liability to any Company Equityholder by virtue of the
failure or refusal of the Stockholder Representative or any of its Non-
Recourse Parties for any reason to consummate the Transactions or relating to
the Stockholder Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and the
agreements ancillary hereto, except for actions or omissions constituting
Fraud. The Stockholder Representative Group shall not be liable for any
action or omission taken by the Stockholder Representative Group pursuant to
the advice of its legal counsel. The Stockholder Representative and its Non-
Recourse Parties shall have no liability in respect of any action, Claim or
proceeding brought against any such Person by any Company Equityholder,
regardless of the legal theory under which such Liability or obligation may
be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at
law or in equity, or otherwise, if any such Person took or omitted taking any
action in good faith.

Time, notwithstanding approval of the Merger and the Transactions by the
Company Stockholders:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  



  

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

  



  

(i) if any court of competent jurisdiction or any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an Order or taken any other action
permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger; or

  



  

(ii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before May1,
2018, unless the failure to consummate the Merger is the result of a breach
of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;

  



  

(c) by Parent, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty contained in _Article III_ shall be or have become untrue, in either
case solely to the extent that any of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2(a)_ , _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_ that have not otherwise been
waived would not be satisfied; _provided_ that, if such breach is curable
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts and for so long as
the Company Equityholders or the Company continues to exercise such
commercially reasonable efforts, Parent, UCBI and Merger Subsidiary may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(c)_ ; and

  



  

(d) by the Company, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on
the part of Parent, UCBI or Merger Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement, or

be or have become untrue, in either case solely to the extent that any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ that have not
otherwise been waived would not be satisfied; _provided_ that, if such breach

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) by Parent within three (3) Business Days of receipt by Parent of
a Supplement delivered pursuant to _Section 6.16_ which discloses any event,
fact or circumstance that has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Company

be amended by action taken by the board of directors of each of UCBI, Merger
Subsidiary, the Company and Parent at any time before the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no amendment shall be made that under
applicable Law requires the approval of the Company's Stockholders without the
approval of such Company Stockholders;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
following approval by the Company Stockholders of this Agreement, any such
amendment may be approved by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
Company Stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 10.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, UCBI and Merger
Subsidiary, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant
hereto by the other; or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein by the other. Any agreement on the part of any
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

Section 11.4. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party, and, except as set forth

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such

to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties

Section 11.8. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, and
that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent, UCBI and Merger Subsidiary, on the other hand, of
any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement,

other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as

Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement and this right shall include the right of the Company to cause the
Merger to be consummated. Parent, UCBI and Merger Subsidiary hereby agree not
to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by Parent, UCBI or Merger Subsidiary, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of Parent, UCBI and Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement.
The parties hereto further agree that (a) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this _Section 11.8_ , a party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that may be available under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) if this Agreement has been terminated or if the
remedies provided for in this _Section 11.8_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (b) nothing set forth in this _Section 11.8_
shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 11.8_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article X_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 11.8_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 11.8 _ restrict or limit any party's
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article X_
or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then
or thereafter.

  



  

Section 11.9. _Disclosure Generally_. All schedules attached hereto
are incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any
of the schedules shall be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement, including
all schedules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Company Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement, the information and
disclosures contained in any Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
be disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other Company Disclosure
Schedule or representation or warranty contained in _Article III_ , as
applicable, as though fully set forth in such Disclosure Schedule or
representation or warranty for which applicability of such information and
disclosure is reasonably apparent notwithstanding the absence of a cross
reference contained therein. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules or exhibits is not intended to
imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included,
or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including
whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or are within or outside of the Ordinary Course of Business, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules or
exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties hereto as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not set forth or included in this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules or exhibits is or is not
required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the
Ordinary Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement. In addition,
matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company
Disclosure Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational
purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. The information contained in this Agreement, in the Company
Disclosure Schedules and exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed
to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract). Nothing in
the Company Disclosure Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or create any
covenant. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall
not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.10. _Attorneys ' Fees_. If there should occur any Legal
Proceeding related to this Agreement, then the non-prevailing party shall pay

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 11.11. _Legal Representation_. In any proceeding by or against
any Parent Group Party wherein any Parent Group Party asserts or prosecutes
any Legal Proceeding under, or otherwise seeks to enforce, this Agreement,
Parent agrees in connection with such proceeding: (a) that no Parent Group
Party or counsel therefor will move to seek disqualification of Greenberg
Traurig; (b) to waive any right any Parent Group Party may have to assert the
attorney-client privilege against Greenberg Traurig or the Stockholder
Representative, any Company Equity Holder or any of their respective
Affiliates with respect to any communication with or information contained in
Greenberg Traurig's possession or files; and (c) to consent to the
representation of the Stockholder Representative, any Company Equityholder or
any of their respective Affiliates by Greenberg Traurig, notwithstanding that
Greenberg Traurig has or may have represented the Stockholder Representative,
any Company Equityholder or any of their respective Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) as counsel in connection with any matter, including any
transaction (including the Transactions), negotiation, investigation,
proceeding or action, prior to or after the Closing. This consent and waiver
extends to Greenberg Traurig's representing the Stockholder Representative,
any Company Equityholder or any of their respective Affiliates against Parent
or any Parent Group Party in litigation, arbitration or mediation in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Any privilege attaching
as a result of Greenberg Traurig's representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions shall survive the Closing
and shall remain in effect, _provided_ that such privilege from and after the
Closing shall be assigned to and controlled by the Stockholder Representative.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees to take
the steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of
Greenberg Traurig representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Transactions shall survive the Closing, remain in effect
and be assigned to and controlled by the Stockholder Representative. As to any
communications among Greenberg Traurig, the Acquired Companies and the
Stockholder Representative that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the
expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary
privilege (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), Parent Group
Party (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), together
with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, agree that no
such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any
action or Legal Proceeding against or involving any of the parties hereto or
any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties after the Closing. Accordingly,
no Parent Group Party (including, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation), shall, without the Stockholder Representative's written
consent, have access to any Privileged Communications, or to the files of
Greenberg Traurig relating to its engagement, whether or not the Closing shall
have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and
after the Closing, (i) the Stockholder Representative and its Affiliates (and
not the Company) shall be the sole holders of the Privileged Communications
with respect to such engagement, and Parent Group Party (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation), shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the
extent that files of Greenberg Traurig in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only the Stockholder Representative and its
Affiliates (and not the Company or any other Parent Group Party) shall hold
such property rights and (iii) Greenberg Traurig shall have no duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any such Privileged Communications or files to any
Parent Group Party by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Greenberg Traurig and the Company or otherwise.

  



  

Section 11.12. _Deliveries to Parent_. Parent agrees and acknowledges
that all documents or other items delivered to Parent or its Representatives
in connection with the Transactions or uploaded and made available in the Data
Room on or before the date that is one Business Day prior to the date hereof
shall be deemed to have been delivered, provided or made available to Parent,
UCBI, Merger Subsidiary or their representatives for all purposes hereunder.

  



  

Section 11.13. _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties
hereto agree and acknowledge that, to the extent any terms and provisions of
this Agreement are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term,
condition or provision of any other agreement, document or instrument
contemplated hereby, this Agreement shall govern and control.

Section 11.14. _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, no party hereto shall be liable for (and the term
Losses shall not include) any consequential damages, including loss of
revenue, income or profits, loss in value of assets or securities, punitive,
special or indirect damages or damages based on a multiple of EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), or of any other
similar financial metric (whether trailing, forward, or otherwise), relating
to any breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.15. _Relationship of the Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to constitute the parties hereto as joint venturers, alter
egos, partners or participants in an unincorporated business or other separate
entity, nor, except as expressly and specifically set forth in _Article IX_ ,
in any manner create any principal agent, fiduciary or other
special relationship between the parties hereto. No party shall have any
duties (including fiduciary duties) towards any other party hereto except as
specifically set forth herein.
