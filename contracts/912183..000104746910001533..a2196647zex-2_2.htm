### (d) The Closing Adjustment Amount shall be deemed conclusively determined

   *Confidential Treatment Requested. Omitted portions filed with the Commission.

  



        
   

  



  

### Stockholders Committee to notify Acquiror of a dispute within 30 days of
the Stockholders Committees receipt of the Acquiror Determination, (y) the
written resolution of all disputes pursuant to Section 1.7(c) above by
Acquiror and the Stockholders Committee, and (z) the resolution of
all disputes by the Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 1.8. If the
Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Adjustment
Amount, Acquiror shall be entitled to receive within three Business Days of
such conclusive determination from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the
absolute value of the difference between the Closing Adjustment Amount and
the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount.

  

### 

  

## 1.8 _Adjustment Dispute Resolution_.  If the Stockholders Committee and
Acquiror are unable to reach agreement concerning the Closing Adjustment
Amount pursuant to Section 1.7(d), they shall submit such dispute to a
nationally recognized independent accounting expert, mutually acceptable to
Acquiror and the Stockholders Committee, which is not the auditor of
Acquiror, the Target or any of their respective Affiliates (the " _Accounting
Referee_ ") for resolution pursuant to this Section 1.8 and instruct the
Accounting Referee to review the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
final determination of the Closing Adjustment Amount. In making such
determination and calculations, the Accounting Referee shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Closing Adjustment Amount or in the Acquiror
Determination as to which Acquiror and the Stockholders Committee have
disagreed in writing. Acquiror and the Stockholders Committee shall instruct
the Accounting Referee to use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to the
Stockholders Committee and Acquiror as promptly as practicable (but in no
event later than 30 days after submission of the dispute to the Accounting
Referee) a report setting forth the Accounting Referees calculation of the
disputed amounts. Such report shall be final and binding upon the
Stockholders Committee, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation, and the
resulting calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount shall be final for all
purposes of this Agreement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Referee shall be borne (i) by Acquiror if the aggregate difference between
the finally determined Closing Adjustment Amount and Acquirors calculation
of such amount at the time the disagreement(s) were submitted to the
Accounting Referee is greater than the aggregate difference between the
finally determined Closing Adjustment Amount and the
Stockholders Committees calculation of such amount at the time the
disagreement(s) were submitted to the Accounting Referee, (ii) by the
Stockholders Committee if the aggregate difference between the finally
determined Closing Adjustment Amount and the Stockholders Committees
calculation of such amount at the time the disagreement(s) were submitted to
the Accounting Referee is greater than the aggregate difference between the
finally determined Closing Adjustment Amount and Acquirors calculation of
such amount at the time the disagreement(s) were submitted to the Accounting
Referee, and (iii) in any other case, one-half by Acquiror and one-half by
the Stockholders Committee.

any of the securities identified below:

  

## 

  

### (a) each share of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Dissenting

made; _plus_  (iii) any cash disbursements required to be made from the
Committee Reimbursement Amount with respect to such share of Target Capital
Stock to the Former Holders thereof pursuant to the terms hereof, _plus_
 (iv) a right to receive a portion of the Contingent Payments, if any, under
Section 9;

  

### 

  

### (b) each share of Target Capital Stock that is owned by Target as

in exchange therefor; and

  

### 

  

### (c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

The amount of cash, if any, that each Former Holder of Target is entitled to
receive for the shares of Target Capital Stock held by such Former Holder
and/or Target Options or Target Warrants held by such Former Holder (as
provided in Section 1.14) shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with $0.005
being rounded upward) and computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable
for all shares of each class and series of Target Capital Stock, Target
Options and Target Warrants held by such Former Holder.

  



  

## 1.10 _Cancellation and Surrender of Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _No Further Rights as Target s stockholders_. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Target Capital Stock, all Target Options and all Target
Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time

_Certificate_ ") or any Target Option or Target Warrant shall have any rights
as a stockholder, optionholder or warrantholder, as the case may be, of
Target or the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror
will cause the Payment Agent to distribute, by electronic mail to each record
holder of Certificates (other than Dissenting Shares), Target Options and
Target Warrants, a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ").  Upon surrender of a
Certificate (in the case of Target Capital Stock) or original option
agreement (in the case of Target Options) or an original warrant (in the case
of Target Warrants), for cancellation, together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, provided that the Effective Time has occurred and
the transactions contemplated hereunder, including the Merger, have
been consummated, (i) the holder of such Certificate, Target Option or
Target Warrant, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount equal to the share of the Merger Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.9(a), Section 1.14(a)
or Section 1.14(b) as applicable, payable in cash in the amounts set forth
therein without any interest thereon, and (ii) all Certificates, original
option agreements and original warrants so surrendered shall forthwith be

### Agent shall, no later than two Business Days after the later of (x) the
Effective Time or (y) the receipt of each properly surrendered Certificate,
option agreement or warrant, cause the payment described in the preceding
sentence (not including any amounts covered by clauses (ii)-(iv) of Sections
1.9(a), 1.14(a) and 1.14(b)) to be made to such Former Holder so surrendering
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
such Former Holder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered with such
Certificate, original option agreements and original warrants, or, by check
(in which case payment shall be made no later than three Business Days after
receipt of each properly surrendered Certificate, option agreement or
warrant) sent to the address designated by such holder in the Letter of
Transmittal delivered with such Certificate, original option agreements and
original warrants. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate,
original option agreement and original warrant that prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Target Capital Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares) will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes,
to evidence the right to receive the payments provided, as applicable, in
Sections 1.9(a), 1.14(a) and 1.14(b). After the surrender and payment
described in the preceding sentence, each Former Holder shall remain entitled
to receive, as applicable, additional cash distributions of the amounts
covered by clauses (ii)-(iv) of Sections 1.9(a), 1.14(a) and 1.14(b). If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Acquiror, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Section 1.10.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Transfers of Ownership_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Target shall be
closed, and there shall thereafter be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Target Capital Stock, Target Options or Target Warrants outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of Target.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) The right of each Former Holder to receive the portion of the
Merger Consideration, if any, to which such Former Holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement upon consummation of the Merger: (i)
shall be personal to such Former Holder; (ii) shall not be transferable by
such Former Holder or any person claiming under such Former Holder, whether
by sale, assignment, pledge or otherwise, except as set forth below in this
Section 1.10(c)(ii) and any other purported transfer shall be void and of no
force or effect; (iii) shall not constitute or represent any equity or
ownership interest in Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation; and (iv) shall
not entitle such Former Holder to any voting or dividend rights, rights to
any other distributions or other rights common to stockholders of the
Surviving Corporation or Acquiror. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Agreement shall not restrict any Former Holder from transferring such Former
Holders right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, to
which such Former Holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement upon
consummation of the Merger (A) to other entities controlled by such Former
Holder, (B) in the case of any Former Holder that is a corporation, general
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or venture
capital firm, to such Former Holders stockholders, partners, members or
other holders of equity securities in such Former Holder, as applicable, (C)
in connection with tax, estate or financial planning, (D) upon the death of
such Former Holder or (E) by operation of law, _provided that_ , (1)
such Former Holder (or in the event of death, if applicable, such Former
Holders executor or legal representative) provides to Acquiror and the
Stockholders Committee prompt written notice of such transfer, which written
notice shall be given in accordance with the

   *Confidential Treatment Requested. Omitted portions filed with the Commission.

  



        
   

  



  

#### provisions of Section 10.1 hereof and shall set forth the name and
address of each transferee, (2) such Former Holder does not receive any
consideration in connection with such transfer and (3) any such permitted
transferee agrees to assume all of the obligations of such Former Holder
under this Agreement to the extent such obligations are applicable to the
portion of the Merger Consideration so transferred to such permitted
transferee. Additionally, each Former Holder that is an entity may transfer
its right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration to which such
Former Holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the
sale of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock (or other
equity securities) of such Former Holder, or any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving such
Former Holder in which such Former Holders stockholders or other equity
owners would cease to own 50% or more of the capital stock (or other equity
securities) of such Former Holder.  Subsequent transfers by any such
transferee of the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration
shall also be made pursuant to, and in accordance with, all of the provisions
of this Section 1.10(c)(ii) to the same extent as if each such transferee
were a Former Holder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
where a provision in this Agreement refers to the payment of any portion of
the Merger Consideration to a Former Holder, the term Former Holder shall be
deemed to include any transferees of such Former Holder, as
permitted pursuant to this Section 1.10(c)(ii).

  

#### 

  

### (d) _No Liability_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.10, neither Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporation or any other
party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat
law or similar law.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Acquiror and Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Former Holder such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Acquiror or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Former Holder in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. To the extent the Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation deducts and withholds any such amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall remit to the appropriate Taxing Authority all such amounts deducted and
withheld.

  

### 

  

## 1.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Acquiror shall pay to
the record holder of such Certificate the consideration payable pursuant to
Section 1.9, 1.14(a) or 1.14(b), as applicable, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by such record holder; _provided, however_ , that
Acquiror may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of such consideration, require such record holder to deliver an
indemnification agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Acquiror as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Acquiror or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, original option
agreement or original warrant.

  



  

## 1.12 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any Dissenting Share shall not be converted into the right
to receive the consideration

   *Confidential Treatment Requested. Omitted portions filed with the Commission.

  



        
   

  



  

## to which the holder of such share (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") would
be entitled pursuant to Section 1.9, but rather shall be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Delaware Law. If any Dissenting
Stockholder fails to perfect such stockholders appraisal rights under
Delaware Law or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with
respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
automatically be converted into the right to receive the consideration
referred to in Section 1.9, without any interest thereon, pursuant to the
exchange procedures set forth in Section 1.10. Target shall give Acquiror (a)
prompt notice of any demand for payment of the fair value of any shares of
Target Capital Stock or any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for
payment and any other instrument served pursuant to Delaware Law and received
by Target relating to any stockholders appraisal rights, and (b) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demands for payment under Delaware Law. Target shall cooperate
with Acquiror concerning, and shall not make any payment with respect to any

subject to the provisions of Section 457A of the Code. Neither Target nor

of nationally recognized reputation) to be (x) on terms, taking into account

### 

  

### (e) Except as permitted by this Section 5.12(e), neither the board of

the board of directors of Target, (IV) at least three Business Days
following receipt by Acquiror of the notice referred to in clause (III)

and stating that the board of directors intends to exercise its right to
enter into an agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that, prior to entering into any such agreement, any amendment to
the price or any other material terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a

amend this Agreement to match such Superior Proposal, Target, the board of
directors of Target and the Stockholders Committee shall accept such

to the contrary expressed or implied in this Section 8.2(a), nothing in this

#### agents, representatives and Affiliates of Acquiror, the Surviving
Corporation and/or Merger Sub (all persons entitled to indemnification under
this Section 8.2(b)(i) being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Damages
related to or arising, directly or indirectly, out of or in connection with
(A) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Target set forth in
Section 2, (B) the breach of any covenant of Target in this Agreement
required to be performed at or prior to the Effective Time, and (C) (1) any
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Target set forth in Section
2.16(p) (disregarding for all purposes of this Section 8 any disclosures on
the Target Disclosure Schedule or otherwise with respect to the
representations and warranties made in such Section 2.16(p)), (2) the
misclassification of any employee as an independent contractor for Tax
purposes, or (3) an underpayment of sales or use Taxes (each a " _Specified
Tax Claim_ ").  For purposes of this Section 8, " _Damages_ " shall mean
any liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, fines, costs, Taxes or
expenses, including reasonable legal, expert and consultant fees and
expenses, but excluding any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or
punitive damages that are not recoverable under Applicable Law by virtue of
not being foreseeable; _provided_ that for purposes of computing the amount
of any Damages incurred by Acquiror there shall be deducted an amount equal
to the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification
payments, contribution payments, tax benefits, or reimbursements actually
received (or, in the case of tax benefits, actually receivable) by Acquiror
or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Damages or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto. The parties agree that any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Section 8, including any amounts released to
Acquiror from the Escrow Fund or offset against any Contingent Payment
pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be treated as a reduction in the aggregate
consideration paid in connection with the Merger for all income Tax purposes.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Any payments made from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section
8.2(b) shall automatically reduce on a pro-rata basis the interest in the
Merger Consideration of each Former Holder that would have otherwise received
such payments. In the event that the Escrow Fund is not sufficient to
indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Acquiror or any of the other
Acquiror Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages to which
Acquiror or such other Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Section 8.2(b), then Acquiror or such other
Acquiror Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall also be entitled to
additional indemnification pursuant to the set off provisions of Section 9.3
hereof.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Limitations of Liability_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) Subject to Section 8.2(c)(iv), the right of Acquiror to be
indemnified from the Escrow Fund and the Contingent Payments pursuant to this
Section 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Target contained in, or any
breach by Target of any covenant or agreement contained in, this Agreement,
or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to Section 8.2(c)(iv), no current or former stockholder,
optionholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate or advisor of Target or
party to the Escrow Agreement shall have any personal or individual liability
of any nature to Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in, or any breach of, this Agreement, or
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

provided in Section 2 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Target Disclosure
Schedule, the Target Determination and the Capitalization Certificate and

matter of this Agreement, express or implied.

this Section 8, the indemnification provided for in this Section 8.2 shall
not apply, and Acquiror shall not be entitled to exercise any indemnification
rights under this Agreement, except to the extent that the aggregate amount
of the Damages against which Acquiror would otherwise be entitled to be
indemnified under this Section 8.2 exceeds $500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_
").  If the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds the Basket Amount,
then Acquiror shall, subject to the other limitations contained herein
(including, without limitation, Section 9.3(a) hereof), be entitled to
be indemnified from the Escrow Fund and the Contingent Payments only against
the portion of such Damages in excess of the Basket Amount; _provided,
however,_ that the limitations set forth in this Section 8.2(c)(ii) shall not
be applicable to any indemnification under this Section 8.2 with respect
to (and Acquiror shall be entitled to be indemnified under this Section
8.2 for any and all Damages, irrespective of the Basket Amount, related to
or arising, directly or indirectly, out of or in connection with) (A)
any breach of any covenant or agreement of Target or any of its Subsidiaries
set forth in this Agreement (a " _Covenant Claim_ "), (B) any breach
of those representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.6 or
the Capitalization Certificate (a " _Capitalization Claim_ "), (C)
any breach of those representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.20,

Specified Tax Claim or any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 2.16 or of the covenants set forth in Section 4.1(m) or
Section 5.13 (each a " _Tax Claim_ ").

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in
this Section 8, the indemnification provided for in this Section 8.2 shall
not apply, and Acquiror shall not be entitled to exercise any indemnification
rights under this Agreement, with respect to a Tax Claim, other than a Tax
Claim related to or arising, directly or indirectly, out of or in connection
with a Specified Tax Claim (each such Tax Claim other than a Specified Tax
Claim, a " _Restricted Tax Claim_ "), except to the extent that the aggregate
amount of the Damages against which Acquiror would otherwise be entitled to
be indemnified under this Section 8.2 with respect to all Restricted Tax
Claims exceeds $50,000 (the " _Tax Basket Amount_ "). If the aggregate amount
of such Damages exceeds the Tax Basket Amount, then Acquiror shall, subject
to the other limitations contained herein (including, without limitation,

have against any person who committed fraud for such fraud (a " _Fraud Claim_
"), nor shall it limit any Partys remedies under Section 10.6 hereof.

### (d) _Defense of Third-Party Claims_. Promptly after Acquiror obtains
knowledge of any actual or possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration,
investigation, inquiry or proceeding that has been or may be brought or
asserted by a third party against Acquiror or any of Acquirors Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates and that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), Acquiror shall promptly give notice of such Third-
Party Claim to the Stockholders Committee, stating the nature and basis of
such Third-Party Claim and the dollar amount of such Third-Party Claim, to
the extent known. The Stockholders Committee shall have the right at its
election, exercisable at any time prior to the 30th day after the
Stockholders Committee obtains knowledge of such Third Party Claim, to
defend any Third-Party Claim (other than a Third-Party Claim that, if decided
in a manner adverse to Acquiror or any of the other Acquiror Indemnified
Parties, could reasonably result in either an obligation to pay monetary
damages in an amount greater than the aggregate cash amount remaining in the
Escrow Fund and available to pay such damages or would materially adversely
affect any of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties or their respective
businesses), in which case: (i) Stockholders Committee shall diligently and
in good faith defend such Third-Party Claim; (ii) the attorneys fees of
counsel reasonably acceptable to Acquiror (approval of such counsel not to be
unreasonably withheld), other professionals and experts fees and court or
arbitration costs incurred by the Stockholders Committee in connection with
defending such Third-Party Claim shall be payable from the Escrow Fund,
without the requirement of any consent or approval by Acquiror; (iii)
Acquiror shall not be entitled to be indemnified (from the Escrow Fund or
otherwise) for any costs or expenses incurred by Acquiror in connection with
the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (iv) Acquiror shall be entitled to
monitor such defense at its expense; (v) Acquiror shall make available to
the Stockholders Committee all books, records and other documents and
materials that are under the direct or indirect control of Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates and that the Stockholders Committee
considers necessary or desirable for the defense of such Third-Party Claim;
(vi) Acquiror shall execute such documents and take such other actions as the
Stockholders Committee may reasonably request for the purpose of
facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise or adjustment
relating to, such Third-Party Claim; (vii) Acquiror shall otherwise fully
cooperate as reasonably requested by the Stockholders Committee in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim; (viii) Acquiror shall not admit any
liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim; and (ix) the Stockholders
Committee shall not enter into any settlement agreement providing for the
settlement of such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
Acquiror (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if such
settlement agreement imposes on Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates any obligation, other than an obligation to pay monetary damages
in an amount less than the aggregate cash amount remaining in the Escrow Fund
and available to pay such damages. If the Stockholders Committee elects not
to defend such Third-Party Claim or otherwise fails or is unable or unwilling
to defend such Third Party Claim, then Acquiror shall have the right at its
election, at any time, to defend such Third-Party Claim, in which case the
provisions of clauses (ii)-(viii) set forth above in this Section 8.2(d)

### 

  

### shall not be applicable to such Third Party Claim and Acquiror shall have
the right to settle and compromise such Third-Party Claim, _provided_  that
Acquiror shall have no right to seek indemnification under this Section 8 in
respect of such Third-Party Claim for any settlement entered into without the
prior written consent of the Stockholders Committee, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Subrogation_. To the extent that Acquiror obtains indemnification
pursuant to this Section 8 with respect to any Damages, the Stockholders
Committee shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any
rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution
and other rights of recovery) that Acquiror or any of Acquirors Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates may have against any other person with respect to such
Damages. Acquiror shall take such actions as the Stockholders Committee may
reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the Stockholders Committee to
perfect or exercise the right of subrogation of the Stockholders Committee
under this Section 8.2(e).

  

### 

  

### (f) _Payment of Indemnification Claims Made by Acquiror Indemnified
Parties_. In the event of any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2 hereof, the Acquiror Indemnified Party will notify the Stockholders
Committee and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent in writing with reasonable
specificity of the amount and circumstances surrounding such claim, provided,
however, that failure to give such notice shall not affect such Acquiror
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party is prejudiced thereby. If within thirty (30) days
of receipt by the Stockholders Committee of any such notice of any claim for
indemnification the Stockholders Committee has not contested such claim in
writing to Acquiror and the Escrow Agent, the full amount thereof shall be
paid to the Acquiror Indemnified Party out of the Escrow Fund to the extent
available and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2(c) hereof,
within two (2) days after the expiration of such 30-day period. In the event
the Stockholders Committee objects to the payment of any such claim, the
amount of any claim not contested shall be paid to the Acquiror and any
amount so contested shall remain with the Escrow Agent until the settlement
or final adjudication of the dispute as evidenced by the final order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or an agreement in writing signed by the
Stockholders Committee and the Acquiror. To the extent the Escrow Fund is
insufficient or not available to satisfy the full amount of such claim for
indemnification, Acquiror shall be entitled to set off, and accordingly
reduce, each Contingent Payment that Acquiror would otherwise be required to
make pursuant to Section 9 hereof, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 8.2(c) hereof and Section 9.3(a).

of this Agreement they hereby accept such appointment), together, as agents
and attorneys-in-fact (" _Stockholders  Committee_") for and on behalf of
the Former Holders, with full power of substitution, to act in the name,
place and stead of each Former Holder with respect to this Section 8, the

of attorney granted in this Section 8.3 is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable, may be delegated by the Stockholders Committee and
shall survive the death or incapacity of any Former Holder. The identity of
members of the Stockholders Committee and the terms of the agency may be
changed, and successor members of the Stockholders Committee may be
appointed, from time to time (including in the event of the death, disability
or other incapacity of a member of the Stockholders Committee) by Former
Holders whose aggregate Pro Rata Portions exceed 50%, and any such successor

faith and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of their duties hereunder (it being understood that any act
done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive

of the Effective Time bears to the portion of the Upfront Payment to which
all Former Holders collectively are entitled as of the Effective Time) agrees
to indemnify the Stockholders Committee against liability for any action
taken or not taken by him in his capacity as such agent. The Committee
Reimbursement Amount, any Contingent Payment and any amounts of the Escrow

and the incurring of legal fees and costs) from the Committee Reimbursement
Amount, any Contingent Payment and any amounts of the Escrow Fund being
released to the Former Holders pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow

construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist
upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a
later date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term
of condition hereof (whether or not similar).
