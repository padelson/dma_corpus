1.4. _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time:

  



  

(a) the constitutional documents of Holdco shall be amended and
restated by adoption of the Memorandum and Articles of Association in

become the constitutional documents of the Surviving Pubco;

  



  

(b) the charter documents of the Company shall be amended and

1.5. _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and as
more particularly set out in the Plan of Merger, the following shall occur in
the Redomestication Merger:

  



  

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Cambridge issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Cambridge Common Stock_ "), including those contained in units of Cambridge
(" _Cambridge Units_ ") consisting of one share of Cambridge Common Stock and
one warrant to purchase one share of Cambridge Common Stock ("
_Cambridge Warrants_ "), will be automatically converted (subject to Section
1.5(c)) into one ordinary share of Surviving Pubco (" _Surviving Pubco
Shares_ ") and the holders thereof shall cease to have any further rights as
holders of Cambridge Common Stock. Each certificate that evidenced Cambridge
Common Stock immediately prior to the Redomestication Merger (" _Cambridge
Common Certificate_ ") shall entitle the holder to the applicable number of
Surviving Pubco Shares into which the Cambridge Common Stock is
convertible according to this Section 1.5(a)(i); provided, however, that each
Cambridge Common Certificate owned by holders who have validly elected to
receive a portion of the proceeds held in Cambridge's Trust Fund (as defined
in Section 3.26 hereof) shall entitle the holder thereof to receive only such
portion of the Trust Fund as provided for in Cambridge's Charter Documents (as
defined below).

  



  

(ii) Each Cambridge Warrant, including those contained in the
Cambridge Units, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding immediately following the Effective
Time but shall be deemed to have been converted and to represent a warrant ("
_Surviving Pubco Warrant_ ") to purchase one Surviving Pubco Share on the same
terms existing under the Cambridge Warrants immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Immediately following the Redomestication Merger, each
certificate that evidenced Cambridge Warrants immediately prior to the
Redomestication Merger (" _Cambridge Warrant Certificate_ " and together with
the Cambridge Common Certificates, the " _Cambridge Certificates_ ") shall
represent the applicable number of Surviving Pubco Warrants into which the
Cambridge Warrants represented thereby have been converted.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Each unit purchase option of Cambridge (" _Cambridge UPOs_ " and
together with the Cambridge Common Stock and Cambridge Warrants, the "
_Cambridge Securities_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding immediately following the Effective
Time but shall be deemed to have been converted and to represent a unit
purchase option (" _Surviving Pubco UPOs_ " and together with the Surviving
Pubco Shares and Surviving Pubco Warrants, the " _Surviving Pubco Securities_
") to purchase units of Surviving Pubco on the same terms existing under the
Cambridge UPOs immediately prior to the Effective Time. Immediately following
the Redomestication Merger, each certificate that evidenced Cambridge UPOs
immediately prior to the Redomestication Merger (" _Cambridge UPO Certificate_
") shall represent the applicable number of Surviving Pubco UPOs into which
the Cambridge UPOs represented thereby have been converted

  



  

(iv) Each share of Cambridge Common Stock and each Cambridge Warrant
held by Cambridge or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion or payment in
respect thereof.

  



  

(v) Certificates representing the Surviving Pubco Shares and Surviving
Pubco Warrants issuable pursuant to Sections 1.5(a)(i) and 1.5(a)(ii)
shall be issued to the holders of Cambridge Certificates upon surrender of
the applicable Cambridge Certificates in the manner provided in Section
1.5(b) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and indemnity, if required) in the manner provided
in Section 1.8).

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, Surviving Pubco shall appoint
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (" _Continental_ "), as agent (the
" _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of exchanging Cambridge Securities for
Surviving Pubco Securities. Upon surrender of the Cambridge Certificates and
delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent, the
holders of such Cambridge Certificates shall be registered in the register of
members of Surviving Pubco and shall receive in exchange therefor
certificates representing Surviving Pubco Securities (" _Surviving Pubco
Certificates_ ") into which their Cambridge Securities shall be converted at
the Effective Time and the Cambridge Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Surviving Pubco shall make available to the Exchange
Agent, as necessary, Surviving Pubco Certificates to be issued in respect of
the Cambridge Certificates surrendered. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Cambridge Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
evidence only the right to receive the shares in Surviving Pubco to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Sections 1.5(a).

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) If certificates representing Surviving Pubco Shares are to be
held in a name other than that in which the Cambridge Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of
the issuance thereof that the Cambridge Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, accompanied by an
instrument of transfer that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Surviving Pubco,
or any agent designated by it, any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of certificates representing shares of Surviving Pubco in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Cambridge Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Surviving Pubco or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(c) _Fractional Shares_. Fractions of a Holdco Share may be issued
as necessary by virtue of the Transactions.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. The number of Surviving Pubco
Shares that the Stockholders and the holders of Cambridge Securities
are entitled to receive as a result of the Transactions shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of (i) any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Cambridge Common Stock or Company Common Shares),
cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
Cambridge Common Stock or Company Common Shares occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (provided there shall not be any
adjustment with respect to the Company Dividend (as defined in Section
5.25)), and (ii) any breach or inaccuracy of either Section 2.3 or 3.3.

  



  

1.6. _Share Exchange_. __

  



  

(a) _Exchange_. All of the Company Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be exchanged at the
Effective Time into the right of the holders thereof to receive
(collectively, the " _Exchange Consideration_ ") an aggregate of:

  



  

(i) $18,150,000 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "),

  



  

(ii) 17,173,267 Surviving Pubco Shares (the " _Closing Date Share

(iii) the Net Income Shares (as defined in Section 1.13) in accordance
with Section 1.13.

  



  

The Exchange Consideration will be issued to the Stockholders as set forth on
_Schedule 1.6_ pro rata with their ownership of Company Common Shares, subject
to the issuance of a portion thereof to those Persons and in those amounts
set forth on _Schedule 1.6_ (each such portion, a " _Pro Rata Portion_ ").

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Share Exchange Steps_. On the Closing Date, the Share Exchange
shall occur in two separate steps:

  



  

(i) the first step is an exchange of 9.473% of the Company Common
Shares in exchange for the Cash Consideration, subject to Section 1.6(c); and

  



  

(ii) the second step, immediately following the first step, is an
exchange of the remaining 90.527% of the Company Common Shares in
exchange for the Closing Date Share Consideration.

  



  

(c) _Cash Consideration; Put Options_.

  



  

(i) The Cash Consideration equal to $18,150,000 shall be distributed
to the Stockholders at Closing, pro rata with their ownership of
Company Common Shares (subject to the issuance of a portion thereof to those
Persons and in those percentages set forth on _Schedule 1.6)_.

  



  

(ii) At Closing, an amount of cash equal to $11,850,000 (the " _Put
Option Escrow Cash_ ") shall be deposited by Surviving Pubco in escrow in
accordance with the escrow agreement (the " _Put Option Escrow Agreement_ ")
prescribed in Schedule 5.31 hereto (the " _Put Option Escrow Account_ ").

  



  

(iii) Each Stockholder (each, a " _Put Option Holder_ ") shall have the
right to put (each, a " _Put Option_ " and collectively, the " _Put Options_
") to the Surviving Pubco of his Pro Rata Portion of up to 1,173,267
Surviving Pubco Shares comprising a portion of the Closing Date Share
Consideration (the " _Put Shares_ ") for an amount in cash equal to (x) the
number of Put Shares subject to such exercise, _multiplied by_ (y) $10.10 per
Put Share, plus (z) his Pro Rata Portion of interest, if any, and subject to
the pre-ruling granted by the Israel Tax Authority (the " _ITA_ "), generated
in the Put Option Escrow, as specifically set forth on _Schedule 1.6_. The Put
Option may be exercised by each Put Option Holder, in whole or in part, on
one occasion by giving written notice to the Surviving Pubco at its principal
executive office, together with the delivery of the Put Shares covered by the
Put Option, at any time during the sixty (60) day period
immediately following the two (2) year anniversary of the end of the full
fiscal year in which Closing occurs (the " _Put Option Exercise Period_ ").
Any exercise of a Put Option with respect to issued Surviving Pubco Shares
shall take effect as a repurchase as a matter of Cayman Islands law. Each Put
Option Holder's written notice shall be signed by such Put Option Holder
and shall state the number of Put Shares with respect to which the Put Option
is being exercised. If the Put Option is exercised by a Put Option Holder
during the Put Option Exercise Period for a number of Put Shares that results
in an amount of cash in the Put Option Escrow Account that is less than his
or its Pro Rata Portion of the total Put Option Escrow Cash, then his or its
Pro Rata Portion of the Put Option Escrow Cash remaining in the Put Option
Escrow Account following distribution of such lesser amount of cash to such
Put Option Holder (or any Permitted Put Option Transferee (as defined below))
with respect to the Put Shares exercised by such Put Option Holder shall be
distributed to the Surviving Pubco. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to
the Lock-up Agreements, nothing herein shall restrict any Put Option Holder
(or any Permitted Put Option Transferee (as defined below)) from selling any
Put Shares if the Put Option Holder provides at least three (3) trading days
prior written notice of any such sale (the " _Notice Period_ ") stating the
number of Put Shares to be sold (a " _Proposed Sale Notice_ "), the Put
Option Holder may sell all or a portion of the Put Shares identified in the
Proposed Sale Notice during the three (3) trading days following the
expiration of the Notice Period (the " _Permitted Sale Period_ ") and the Put
Option Holder shall provide written notice of the number of such Put Shares
that were sold by the end of the trading day following the expiration of the
Permitted Sale Period (the " _Final Sale Notice_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, during the Put Option Escrow Period _,_ no Put Option Holder may
encumber or otherwise subject the Put Shares applicable to him to any Lien.

(iv) For purposes hereof, (A) " _Permitted Put Option Transferee_ "
means (x) a beneficiary, "family member" (where a "family member" means any

transferor or of the transferor's spouse) or trusts, family
limited partnerships and similar entities primarily for the benefit of the
Put Option Holder or the Put Option Holder's family members or (y) an
Affiliate of the Put Option Holder or any investment fund or entity controlled
or managed by the Put Option Holder, including, if the Put Option Holder is a
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business entity,
a distribution of securities to limited or general partners, members,
shareholders or other equity holders of the Put Option Holder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in each and any such event it shall be a condition to the
transfer that the transferee execute an agreement stating that the transferee
is receiving and holding the Put Option subject to the provisions of this
Agreement applicable to the Put Option, and (B) " _Put Option Escrow Period_
" means the period through the two (2) year anniversary of the end of the
full fiscal year in which the Closing occurs.

covered by same and payment therefor shall be consummated within ten business
days of such exercise and the applicable Put Holders and the Surviving Pubco
shall cooperate in the prompt consummation of same; provided that, prior to

(d) _Surrender of Company Certificates_. Subject to Section 1.10 and
_Schedule 1.6_ , the Exchange Consideration shall be paid and issued to the
holders of certificates representing the Company Common Shares (the " _Company
Certificates_ ") upon surrender of their respective Company Certificates (or
in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit (and indemnity, if required) in the manner provided in Section 1.8,
or in the case of an uncertificated share, by delivery of a copy of the
register of members of the Company indicating such holder as entitled to the
shares). After the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Certificate will
be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Exchange Consideration in accordance with the
provisions of this Article I.

  



  

(e) _United States Tax Characterizations_. With respect to the
holders of Cambridge Securities, it is the intention of the parties
hereto that (a) the Redomestication Merger shall be properly treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and (b) that the Redomestication Merger and
the Share Exchange shall otherwise be treated as integrated transactions for
United States income tax purposes for such holders. __

  



  

(f) _Israeli Tax Matters_

  



  

(i) _Withholding of Tax_. All payments to the Stockholders under
this agreement shall be subject to withholding of taxes under the laws of the
State of Israel. Surviving Pubco and the escrow agent appointed for the
purposes of subsection (c) of this Section 1.6(f) shall be entitled to
withhold Israeli tax from the payments hereunder at the maximum rate provided
for under the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event that any of
the Stockholders shall timely provide the payor with a valid certificate
issued by the Israeli Tax Authority for the exemption from withholding tax
or for the withholding of tax at a lesser percentage or amount provided under
the law, the provisions of the said tax certificate shall prevail. Any amount
withheld and paid over to the Israeli Tax Authority shall be deemed paid on
account of the respective amount payable under this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) _Tax Pre-Ruling_. The Company and the Stockholders shall be
entitled to apply to the Israeli Tax Authority for rulings regulating the
transactions contemplated hereunder for Israeli tax purposes. The language of
any such application shall require the prior written consent of Cambridge
only with respect to limitations in the rulings that relate to Surviving Pubco
stockholders which are not the Stockholders or with respect to Surviving
Pubco itself, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

1.7. _No Distributions Until Surrender of Certificates_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of
this Agreement with respect to Surviving Pubco Shares with a record date
after the Closing Date will be paid to the holders of any
unsurrendered Cambridge Certificates or Company Certificates with respect to
the Surviving Pubco Shares to be issued upon surrender thereof until the
holders of record of such Cambridge Certificates or Company Certificates shall
surrender such Cambridge Certificates or Company Certificates. Subject to
Applicable Law, following surrender of any such Cambridge Certificates or
Company Certificates with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
Surviving Pubco shall register the record holder thereof in the register of
members of Surviving Pubco and shall deliver to the record holders thereof,
without interest, the Surviving Pubco Certificates representing Surviving
Pubco Shares issued in exchange therefor and the amount of any such dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Closing Date theretofore
paid with respect to such Surviving Pubco Shares. For the avoidance of doubt,
this Section 1.7 does not affect the distribution of the cash dividend as set
forth in Section 5.27.

  



  

   

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.8. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Cambridge Certificates or Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, Surviving Pubco shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Cambridge Certificates or Company Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the certificates representing
the Surviving Pubco Shares that the shares of Cambridge Common Stock,
Cambridge Warrants, Company Common Shares formerly represented by
such Cambridge Certificates or Company Certificates were converted into and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7; provided,
however, that as a condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates
representing Surviving Pubco Shares and other distributions, the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Cambridge Certificates or Company Certificates
shall indemnify Surviving Pubco against any claim that may be made against
Surviving Pubco with respect to the Cambridge Certificates or
Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

1.9. _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the then current officers and
directors of Cambridge and Surviving Pubco and the officers and directors of
the Company shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

  



  

1.10. _Continental Escrow_. As the sole remedy for the indemnification
obligations set forth in Article VII of this Agreement, a portion of the
Closing Date Share Consideration (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") having an aggregate
value (based on $10.10 per share) equal to five percent (5%) of the Total
Closing Date Consideration shall be deposited in escrow (the " _Escrow
Account_ "), which escrow amount deposited shall be allocated among the
Stockholders in the same proportion as their proportionate share of the total
Company Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, all in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement to be
entered into at the Closing as prescribed in _Schedule 5.31_ with Continental
Stock Trust and Transfer serving as escrow agent (" _Continental Escrow
Agent_ "), substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ hereto (the "
_Continental Escrow Agreement_ "). On the first anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " _Basic Indemnity Escrow Termination Date_ "), the Continental
Escrow Agent shall release fifty percent (50%) of the original number of
Escrow Shares to the Stockholders, less any of such shares applied in
satisfaction of a claim for indemnification pursuant to Article VIII and any
of such shares related to a claim that is then unresolved in the same
proportions as originally deposited into escrow. The remaining Escrow Shares
(the " _Additional Indemnity Shares_ ") shall be available for indemnification
only with respect to Additional Indemnification Claims (each as hereinafter
defined). On the earlier of (x) the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (y) the thirtieth (30th) day following the filing by
Surviving Pubco of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending
December 31, 2016 with the SEC (the " _Additional Indemnity Escrow Termination
Date_ "), the Continental Escrow Agent shall deliver the Additional Indemnity
Shares, less any of such shares applied in satisfaction of an Additional
Indemnification Claim and any of such shares related to an Additional
Indemnification Claim that is then unresolved, to each recipient in the same
proportions as initially deposited in escrow. Any Escrow Shares held with
respect to any unresolved claim for indemnification and not applied as
indemnification with respect to such claim upon its resolution shall be
delivered to such Persons promptly upon such resolution. " _Additional
Indemnification Claim_ " means a claim for indemnification pursuant to
Article VII.

2015, Surviving Pubco has Net Income equal to or greater than
$27,000,000 (the " _2015 Net Income Target_ "), Surviving Pubco shall issue
to the Stockholders, in the aggregate, 3,600,000 Surviving Pubco Shares (the
" _2015 Net Income Shares_ ").

  



  

(b) If, for the fiscal year of Surviving Pubco ending December 31,
2016, Surviving Pubco has Net Income equal to or greater than
$40,000,000 (the " _2016 Net Income Target_ "), Surviving Pubco shall issue

" _2016 Net Income Shares_ ").

  



  

   

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If, for the fiscal year of Surviving Pubco ending December 31,
2017, Surviving Pubco has Net Income equal to or greater than
$60,000,000 (the " _2017 Net Income Target_ "), Surviving Pubco shall issue
to the Stockholders, in the aggregate, 2,000,000 Surviving Pubco Shares (the
" _2017 Net Income Shares_ ").

  



  

(d) If, for the fiscal year of Surviving Pubco ending December 31,
2018, Surviving Pubco has Net Income equal to or greater than
$80,000,000 (the " _2018 Net Income Target_ "), Surviving Pubco shall issue
to the Stockholders, in the aggregate, 1,000,000 Surviving Pubco Shares (the
" _2018 Net Income Shares_ ").

  



  

(e) In the event that Surviving Pubco fails to satisfy the Net Income
Target for any fiscal year but Net Income for such fiscal year is ninety
percent (90%) or more of the Net Income Target for such fiscal year, then
Surviving Pubco shall issue to the Stockholders, in the aggregate, such
number of Surviving Pubco Shares equal to the product obtained by (x) the Net
Income Shares that would have been issued to the Stockholders had the Net
Income Target been achieved _multiplied by_ (y) the quotient obtained by (A)
the Net Income for such fiscal year _divided by_ (B) the Net Income Target
for such fiscal year. For instance and solely by way of illustration, if the
Net Income for the 2015 fiscal year equals $24,300,000, the 2015 Net Income
Shares issuable to the Stockholders shall equal 3,240,000 Surviving Pubco
Shares.

  



  

(f) In the event that Surviving Pubco fails to satisfy the 2015 Net
Income Target but satisfies the 2016 Net Income Target, then Surviving Pubco
shall issue to the Stockholders, in addition to the 2016 Net Income Shares
required to be issued by Surviving Pubco as a result of Surviving Pubco
achieving the 2016 Net Income Target, the 2015 Net Income Shares. In addition,
(i) if Surviving Pubco fails to satisfy the 2015 Net Income Target but Net
Income for such fiscal year is ninety percent (90%) or more of the 2015
Net Income Target (i.e., 92%) and Net Income for 2016 is a higher percentage
of the 2016 Net Income Target (i.e., 97%), then Surviving Pubco shall issue
to the Stockholders, in addition to the pro rata 2016 Net Income Shares (i.e.,
97%) required by Section 1.13(e), such number of Surviving Pubco Shares for
2015 in accordance Section 1.13(e) based on the difference (i.e. 5%) between
the percentage of Net Income for 2016 as compared to the 2016 Net Income
Target (i.e. 97%) and the Net Income for 2015 as compared to the 2015 Net
Income Target (i.e. 92%), or (ii) if Surviving Pubco fails to satisfy the 2015
Net Income Target and Net Income for such fiscal year is less than ninety
percent (90%) of the 2015 Net Income Target but Net Income for 2016 is ninety
percent (90%) or more of the 2016 Net Income Target (i.e. 95%), then
Surviving Pubco shall issue to the Stockholders, in addition to the pro rata
of 2016 Net Income Shares (i.e. 95%) required by Section 1.13(e), such number
of Surviving Pubco Shares for 2015 in accordance Section 1.13(e) based on the
same percentage of Net Income for 2016 as compared to the 2016 Net Income
Target (i.e. 95%). For purposes of clarity, the catch-up allowance described
in this clause (f) shall not apply to any other time periods or targets other
than those specifically referenced in this clause (f).

  



  

   

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) As used herein,

  



  

(i) " _Net Income_ " means net income of Surviving Pubco as set forth
in Surviving Pubco's audited financial statements for any applicable year, as
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the
United States (" _U.S. GAAP_ "). Net Income shall not take into account any
net income (loss) that exists for a company acquired by Surviving Pubco or
the Company after the Effective Time at the time of its acquisition;
_provided_ , _however_ , any subsequent net income (loss) after the date of
such acquisition shall be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether the Net Income targets have been achieved. For instance and solely by
way of illustration, if the Company acquires a company with $1 million of net
income on October 31, 2015, any net income in November 2015 and December 2015
would be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the 2015 Net
Income target has been achieved, and then if net income attributable to such
acquisition was $6 million in 2016, then $6 million of such 2016 net income
would be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the 2016 Net
Income target has been achieved. In addition, the calculation of Net Income
for all purposes under this Section 1.13 shall not include (x) any expenses
paid or incurred by the Company, Surviving Pubco or Cambridge in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or as otherwise set forth on
Schedule 5.23 of this Agreement; and (y) any and all losses or expenses
incurred by the Company, Surviving Pubco or Cambridge in connection with the
litigation described on Schedule 3.10.

  



  

(ii) " _Net Income Shares_ " means, subject to Section 1.13(e), the
sum of the 2015 Net Income Shares, the 2016 Net Income Shares, the 2017 Net
Income Shares and the 2018 Net Income Shares issuable pursuant to this Section
1.13.

  



  

(iii) " _Net Income Target_ " means, as the context requires, each of
the 2015 Net Income Target, the 2016 Net Income Target, the 2017 Net Income
Target or the 2018 Net Income Target.

  



  

(h) Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, any Net Income Shares
to be issued pursuant to this Section 1.13 shall be (i) issued
automatically and without requiring approval from the Surviving Pubco Board
other than approvals granted in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, (ii) allocated as set forth on _Schedule 1.13(h)_ , and (iii)
automatically equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately (x) the effect of
any stock split, consolidation, reverse stock split, share dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Surviving Pubco
Shares), cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the Surviving Pubco Shares occurring on or after the date such Net
Income Shares are issued, and (y) any breach or inaccuracy of either Section
2.3 or 3.3.

  



  

   

 | 14| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) Not later than 150 days after the fiscal year with respect to
which Net Income is calculated, Surviving Pubco shall deliver to
the Cambridge Representative its Net Income calculation (the " _Net Income
Calculation_ "), which shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
unless the Cambridge Representative, within ten (10) Business Days after its
receipt of the Net Income Calculation, notifies Surviving Pubco in writing
that it disputes any of the amounts set forth therein, specifying the nature
of the dispute and the basis therefore. The parties shall in good faith
attempt to resolve any dispute and, if the parties so resolve all disputes,
the Net Income Calculation, as amended to the extent necessary to reflect the
resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. If
the parties do not reach agreement in resolving the dispute within ten (10)
Business Days after notice is given to Surviving Pubco by the Cambridge
Representative, the parties shall submit the dispute to an
independent accounting firm which is mutually agreeable to the parties (the "
_Accounting Arbiter_ "). Within thirty (30) days of such submission, the
Accounting Arbiter shall determine (it being understood that in making such
determination, the Accounting Arbiter shall be functioning as an expert and
not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by Surviving Pubco
and the Cambridge Representative, and not by independent review, only those
issues in dispute and shall render a written report as to the resolution of
the dispute and the resulting Net Income Calculation which shall be conclusive
and binding on the parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting
Arbiter (x) shall be bound by the provisions of this Section 1.13(g) and (y)
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
items claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such items
claimed by either party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Arbiter shall be borne by Surviving Pubco. Subject to the requirement to act
in good faith in accordance with Section 1.11 herein, the Cambridge
Representative shall be entitled to engage a firm of independent accountants
to advise it with respect to the Net Income Calculation, with the all
fees and expenses of such firm to be paid by Surviving Pubco.

  



  

(j) Except as set forth in Section 1.13(d), Net Income Shares shall
be issued to the Persons entitled to them no later than thirty (30)
days after the Net Income Calculation becomes conclusive and binding for the
fiscal year with respect to such Net Income Shares are earned.

  



  

1.14. _Sale Restriction_. Prior to the Effective Time, (i) those
Persons set forth on _Schedule 1.14(i)_ shall enter into a Lock-Up Agreement
in the form of _Exhibit D-1_ (the " _One Year Lock-Up Agreement_ "), and (ii)
those Persons set forth on _Schedule 1.14(ii)_ shall enter into a Lock-Up
Agreement in the form of _Exhibit D-2_ (the " _Two Year Lock-Up Agreement,_ "
and together with the One Year Lock-Up Agreement, the " _Lock-Up Agreements_
"). Surviving Pubco's register of members and the Surviving Pubco
Certificates evidencing the Surviving Pubco Shares issued as a result of the
Share Exchange shall each include prominent disclosure or bear a prominent
legend evidencing the fact that such shares are subject to such Lock-Up
Agreements.

properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities

ARTICLE VII. 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

7.1. _Indemnification of Surviving Pubco by the Stockholders_.

  



  

(a) Effective at and after the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article VII (including the limitations set forth
in Section 7.4), the Surviving Pubco and its representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be indemnified,
defended and held harmless, through the availability of the Escrow Shares and
solely to the extent of the Escrow Shares, from and against all Losses
asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by any Indemnified
Party by reason of, arising out of or resulting from:

  



  

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, including any
Schedule or ancillary agreement hereto, or contained in any certificate
delivered by the Company to Cambridge pursuant to this Agreement with respect
hereto or thereto in connection with the Closing; and

  



  

(ii) the non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Company contained in this Agreement.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.1, the matter set forth
on Schedule 2.10 shall not be subject to this Article VII, and no
indemnification obligations shall apply hereunder.

  



  

(b) As used in this Article VII, the term " _Losses_ " shall include
on a dollar for dollar basis all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
awards, orders, penalties, settlements, costs and expenses (including
interest, penalties, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses)
including those arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions, costs of
investigation, notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of action,
proceedings and assessments whether or not made by third parties or whether
or not ultimately determined to be valid; provided that in no event will
Losses include any indirect, incidental, remote, exemplary, special,
consequential, diminution of value, failure to realize savings or benefits,
punitive, lost profits, loss of use, or other multiple-based losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, orders, penalties, settlements, costs
or expenses.

  



  

   

 | 63| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Solely for the purpose of determining the amount of any Losses
(and not for determining whether a representation or warranty or covenant has
been breached or is inaccurate) for which the Indemnified Parties may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article VII, any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified by a term or terms such
as "material," "materially," or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed
made or given without such qualification and without giving effect to such
words.

  



  

(d) Any payment for an Indemnifiable Loss pursuant to this Section
7.1 shall be made out of the Escrow Shares by transferring to the Surviving
Pubco that number of Escrow Shares that is equal to the amount of the
Indemnifiable Loss as determined by the terms of the Continental Escrow
Agreement, subject to _Section 7.4_. As used in this _Article VII_ , the term
" _Indemnifiable Loss_ " means an amount equal to (A) the amount of any Loss
_multiplied_ by the number that is (B) equal to one  _minus_ the quotient of
(1) the total number of shares representing the Closing Date Share
Consideration, including the Escrow Shares, _divided_ by (2) the total number
of shares of Surviving Pubco Shares issued and outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the Closing.

  



  

7.2. _Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. The indemnification
obligations and liabilities under this _Article VII_ with respect to
actions, proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other claims
brought against a party under an obligation to indemnify pursuant to Sections
7.1 other than the Indemnified Parties (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:

  



  

(a) _Notice of Claim_. The Indemnified Parties will give the
Stockholders prompt written notice after receiving written notice of
any Third Party Claim or discovering the liability, obligation or facts
giving rise to such Third Party Claim (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") which Notice
of Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of the nature of
the Third Party Claim, (ii) the underlying representation, warranty or
covenant alleged to have been breached and the facts then known on which such
alleged breach is based, (iii) the total amount of the actual out-of-pocket
Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or expenses which
have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith), and (iv)
whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any insurance
and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered under such
insurance, and the Stockholders shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of Third Party Claim at their expense.

  



  

   

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Defense_. The Stockholders shall have the right, at their
option (subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7.2(c) below) and
at their own expense, by written notice to the Indemnified Parties, to assume
the entire control of, subject to the right of the Indemnified Parties to
participate (at their expense and with counsel of their choice) in, the
defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim as to which such
Notice of Claim has been given, and shall be entitled to appoint a recognized
and reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense;
provided that the Stockholders' assumption of the defense of a Third Party
Claim will not, vis-a-vis the Indemnified Parties, constitute acceptance of
liability to the Indemnified Parties under this Article VII. So long as the
Stockholders are contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified
Parties shall not pay or settle any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right
to pay or settle any such claim at any time, provided that in such event, the
Indemnified Parties shall waive any right of indemnification therefor under
this Article VII. If the Stockholders elect to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim:

  



  

(i) the Stockholders shall diligently and in good faith defend such
Third Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified Parties reasonably informed
of the status of such defense and shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided,
however, that the Stockholders shall obtain the prior written consent of the
applicable Indemnified Party before entering into any compromise or
settlement of such Third Party Claim, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided further _,_ that no such consent
shall be required for any such compromise or settlement that: (A) is
exclusively monetary and will be paid in full out of the Escrow Shares (rather
than by the applicable Indemnified Party); (B) does not contain an admission
of liability on the part of any Indemnified Party; and (C) unconditionally and
fully releases the applicable Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim; and

  



  

(ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate fully in all respects
with the Stockholders in any such defense, compromise or settlement
thereof, including the selection of counsel and in making any related
counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-
complaint against any Person, and the Indemnified Parties shall make available
to the Stockholders all pertinent information and documents under its
control, including by providing the Stockholders with reasonable access during
normal business hours of the applicable Indemnified Party to books, records
and personnel of the applicable Indemnified Party (but only to the extent
relevant to such Third Party Claim).

  



  

(c) _Limitations of Right to Assume Defense_. The Stockholders shall
not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) the Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Stockholders which is not
merely incidental to a primary damage claim or claims for monetary damages;
or (iii) there is a reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim would
result in a Material Adverse Effect of Surviving Pubco.

  



  

   

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or
to provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant
available data shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any
Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Parties against the Indemnifying Parties
and shall not affect the Indemnifying Parties' duties or obligations under
this Article VII, except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such
failure shall have (i) adversely affected the ability of the Stockholders to
defend against or reduce the Indemnifiable Losses or (ii) caused or increased
such Indemnifiable Losses or otherwise caused the Indemnifiable Losses to be
greater than such Indemnifiable Losses would have been had the Indemnified
Parties given the Stockholders prompt notice hereunder. So long as the
Stockholders are defending any such action actively and in good faith, the
Indemnified Parties shall not settle such action. The Indemnified Parties
shall make available to the Stockholders all relevant records and other
relevant materials required by them and in the possession or under the control
of the Indemnified Parties, for the use of the Stockholders and their
representatives in defending any such action, and shall in other respects give
reasonable cooperation in such defense.

  



  

(e) _Failure to Defend_. If the Stockholders, promptly after
receiving a Notice of Claim, fail to defend such Third Party Claim in
good faith, the Indemnified Parties, at their own cost and expense, will
(upon further written notice) have the right to undertake the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim as they may determine in
their reasonable discretion, provided that the Stockholders shall have the
right to approve any settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(f) _Indemnifying Parties Consent_. Unless the Stockholders have
consented to a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of the
settlement shall not be a binding determination of the amount of the Loss and
such amount shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the
Continental Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Advancement of Defense Costs_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Surviving Pubco shall advance to or pay on
behalf of the Stockholders the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Stockholders in connection with the defense of any alleged
Indemnifiable Matter asserted by the Surviving Pubco, including reasonable
attorneys' fees; provided, however, if it is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that the Indemnifiable Losses related to any such
indemnifiable matter shall be satisfied through the availability of the
Escrow Shares, the advances to or payments made on behalf of the
Stockholders shall count towards the aggregate Indemnifiable Losses incurred
by the Surviving Pubco in connection with such indemnifiable matter.

  



  

   

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.3. _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Losses that are
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII are covered by
insurance paid for by the Surviving Pubco or the Company prior to or after the
Closing, the Surviving Pubco and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such insurance;
provided that the Indemnified Parties shall nevertheless be entitled to bring
a claim for indemnification under this Article VII in respect of such Losses
and the time limitations set forth in Section 7.4 hereof for bringing a claim
of indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency
of such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by the Indemnified Parties
for monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss
shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification
provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing from
the Escrow Shares. If the Surviving Pubco has received the payment
required by this Agreement from the Escrow Shares in respect of any Loss and
later receives proceeds from insurance or other amounts in respect of such
Loss, then it shall hold such proceeds or other amounts in trust for the
benefit of the Stockholders and shall return to escrow the Escrow Shares
released to the Indemnified Parties or in the event of a subsequent sale
thereof, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum equal to the amount
of such proceeds or other amount realized by the Indemnified Parties
upon such sale. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is
the intention of the parties that no insurer or any other third party shall
be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the
absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the
responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

  



  

7.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Article VII or elsewhere in this Agreement, the
following terms will apply to any claim arising out of this Agreement or
related to the transactions contemplated hereby:

  



  

(a) _Survival: Time Limitation_. The representations and warranties
of the parties under this Agreement will survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, at which
time such representations and warranties will expire (the " _Basic Survival
Period_ ") except that the right of the Indemnified Parties to bring (i)
Additional Indemnity Claims shall survive the Closing for the period that
ends on the Additional Indemnity Escrow Termination Date (the "
_Additional Indemnity Survival Period_ "), (ii) Claims for the breach of the
representations and warranties in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) and 2.4, 1.12(b)(i)
and 1.12(b)(ii) shall survive without limitation as to time, and (iii) Claims
for the breach of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.1 and 3.4
shall survive without limitation as to time. The covenants and agreements of
the parties hereto contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith shall
survive the Closing indefinitely or for the shorter period explicitly
specified therein, except that for such covenants and agreements that survive
for such shorter period, breaches thereof shall survive indefinitely or until
the latest date permitted by law.

  



  

(b) Any indemnification claim made by the Indemnified Parties prior
to the termination of the Basic Survival Period or the Additional
Indemnity Survival Period (each a " _Survival Period_ "), as the case may be,
in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement shall be preserved
despite the subsequent termination of such Survival Period and any claim set
forth in a Notice of Claim sent prior to the expiration of such Survival
Period shall survive until final resolution thereof. Except as set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence, no claim for indemnification under
this Article VII shall be brought after the end of the Survival Period or the
Additional Indemnity Survival Period, as the case may be.

  



  

   

 | 67| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Deductible_. No amount shall be payable under Article VII
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Indemnifiable Losses otherwise
payable exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event all
Indemnifiable Losses so due in excess of the Deductible shall be paid out of
the Escrow Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Deductible shall not apply to any claims for Indemnifiable Losses for the
breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.6
(Compliance).

  



  

(d) _Aggregate Amount Limitations_. The aggregate liability for
Losses pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not in any event exceed the
Escrow Shares in the case of Basic Indemnity Claims or the Additional
Indemnity Shares in the case of Additional Indemnity Claims, and Surviving
Pubco shall have no claim against the Stockholders other than for any of such
Escrow Shares (and any non-cash dividends declared and actually paid with
respect to the Escrow Shares).

  



  

(e) _No Double Recovery_. In the event that any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VII are recoverable under more
than one provision of this Agreement, the Indemnified Parties will only be
permitted to recover with respect to any particular Losses suffered by it one
time as it is the parties' intention that once any particular Losses have been
recovered by the Indemnified Parties under one provision, such Losses no
longer exist and, therefore, recovery by the Indemnified Parties for such
same Losses under another provision would constitute an unintended and
prohibited "double" recovery.

  



  

(f) _Miscellaneous Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise, the Indemnified
Parties will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1 for
any Loss underlying such indemnification claim to the extent that: (i) the
Indemnified Parties could have, with commercially reasonable efforts,
mitigated or prevented such Loss (or any part thereof); (ii) such Loss (or
any part thereof) results from or is increased by the action or inaction of
any Indemnified Parties or any Affiliate thereof; (iii) such Loss (or any
part thereof) arises, or is increased, as a result of a change after the
Closing in any accounting principle, method or policy, or (iv) Cambridge had,
prior to the Closing Date, actual knowledge of a breach of the applicable
representation, warranty or covenant.

  



  

7.5. _EXCLUSIVE REMEDY_. HOLDCO (WHICH SHALL SURVIVE THE
REDOMESTICATION MERGER TO BECOME SURVIVING PUBCO, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE
OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, FROM AND
AFTER THE CLOSING, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES
WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS FOR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE PURSUANT AND SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE VII. ACCORDINGLY, EACH OF
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY REMEDY,
LIABILITY AND ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE PURSUANT TO LAW OR EQUITY OTHER THAN
THE REMEDIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED UNDER THIS ARTICLE VII. FURTHERMORE, EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT COVENANTS NOT TO SUE OR OTHERWISE THREATEN ANY CLAIM
THAT INCLUDES ANY REMEDY WAIVED BY THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, AND SUCH PARTIES
AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE
AGREEMENT, WAIVERS AND RELEASES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 7.5 ARE CONSPICUOUS.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE VII
SHALL IN ANY WAY IMPAIR, MODIFY OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES'
RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM, DEMAND OR SUIT AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY BASED UPON
SUCH OTHER PARTY'S ACTUAL FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISREPRESENTATION
OR OMISSION, IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT A MERE BREACH OF A REPRESENTATION AND
WARRANTY, WITHOUT INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISREPRESENTATION OR OMISSION, DOES
NOT CONSTITUTE FRAUD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, AND FOR PURPOSE
OF FURTHER CLARITY, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS SECTION 7.5,
SHALL SERVE TO LIMIT OR ELIMINATE ANY REMEDY AVAILABLE TO CAMBRIDGE OR THE
SURVIVING PUBCO AT LAW OR EQUITY UNDER THE JOINT VENTURE ACQUISITION
AGREEMENT.

  



  

   

 | 68| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.6. _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid for
indemnification under Article VII shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the
value of the Surviving Pubco Shares issued by Surviving Pubco as a result of
the Transactions, except as otherwise required by Law.

  



  

7.7. _Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow Shares_. The
parties acknowledge that the Cambridge Representative's obligations under
this Article VII are solely as a representative of the stockholders of
Cambridge immediately prior to the Effective Time in the manner set forth in
the Continental Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations to indemnify
the Surviving Pubco under this Article VIII and that the Cambridge
Representative shall have no personal responsibility for any expenses
incurred by him in such capacity and that all payments to the Surviving Pubco
as a result of such indemnification obligations shall be made solely from,
and to the extent of, the Escrow Shares. Reasonable and actual out-of-pocket
expenses of the Cambridge Representative for attorneys' fees and other costs
shall be borne in the first instance by the Surviving Pubco, which may make a
claim for reimbursement thereof as part of the Indemnifiable Losses against
the Escrow Shares upon the claim with respect to which such expenses are
incurred becoming an Established Claim (as defined in the Continental Escrow
Agreement). The Continental Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Continental Escrow
Agreement after the Closing, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Shares
to satisfy any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII. The
value of the Escrow Shares shall be determined in accordance with this
Agreement and the Continental Escrow Agreement. The Continental Escrow Agent
will hold the remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final resolution
of all claims for indemnification or disputes relating thereto.

  



  

7.8. _Tax Benefits_. The amount of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided shall be reduced by any net Tax benefit to
such Indemnified Party and its Affiliates, to the extent realized by such
party as a result of such Losses, including the present value (determined by
discounting at 8%) of the benefit arising from an increase in the Tax basis of
assets, net of any Tax costs incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of
the receipt of the indemnification payments hereunder. In calculating the
amount of net Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall be
presumed to pay Taxes at a forty percent (40%) Tax rate. The
Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such
documentation as may be reasonably requested in order to ascertain or
confirm the amount of any net Tax benefit or net Tax cost referred to herein.

  



  

   

 | 69| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.9. _Mitigation_. A Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by it
arising out of any matter for which it is entitled to indemnification
hereunder; provided that no Indemnified Party shall be required to (i) take
any action or refrain from taking any action that is contrary to any
applicable Contract, order or law binding on it or any Affiliate thereof or
(ii) incur any out-of-pocket expense in connection with such mitigation (other
than de minimis incidental expenses).

  



  

7.10. _NO RELIANCE_. AS MODIFIED BY THE APPLICABLE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULES, THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE II AND CAMBRIDGE AND HOLDCO IN ARTICLE III, CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AND
IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT HERETO. EXCEPT FOR SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAKES ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE. EACH PARTY CONFIRMS THAT IT IS NOT RELYING ON ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH
PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS NO RELIANCE CONFIRMATION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT
TO THE OTHER PARTY'S WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND CONSUMMATE
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND BY ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT
HERETO. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE II, THE COMPANY IS NOT MAKING
AND HAS NOT MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO MATERIALS
FURNISHED TO CAMBRIDGE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE DILIGENCE PROCESS OR
OTHERWISE (INCLUDING FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONAL FORECASTS) OR MATTERS THAT WERE
DISCUSSED ORALLY OR IN WRITING ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE HEREOF.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII. 
 TERMINATION

  



  

8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a) by mutual written agreement of Cambridge and the Company at any
time;

  



  

(b) by either Cambridge or the Company if the Transactions shall not
have been consummated by December 23, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ ") for
any reason; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose action or
