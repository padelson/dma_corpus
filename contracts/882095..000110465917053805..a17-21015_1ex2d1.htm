 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of August 27, 2017, by and among: Gilead Sciences, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "); Dodgers Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation

Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms
used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

(A) Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a tender offer (as it may

accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(B) As soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser
will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company

Price, in cash, without interest, and (ii) the Company shall become a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger.

 



 

(C) The board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") has
unanimously (i) approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for the
Company to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery

(D) The board of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively, to

(E) Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger

The Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 



 

 **SECTION 1**

 



 

 ** _THE OFFER_**

 



 

 **1.1 The Offer**.

 



 

(a) **Commencement of the Offer**. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with _Section 8_, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) business
days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having timely
provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to _Sections
1.1(e)_ and _1.2(b)_ ), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)

to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to _Sections 2.5(a)(i)_ and _2.5(a)(ii)_ (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ")), at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price, net to
the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of Tax in
accordance with _Section 2.6(e)_.

 



 

(b) **Terms and Conditions of the Offer**. The obligations of Purchaser to
(and of Parent to cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, any

shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements) of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_
(collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "), and no other conditions. The Offer
shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ")
that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition,
the Termination Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to (i) increase the amount of cash constituting the Offer
Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition (to the extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements) and (iii) make any other changes in the terms
and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in

purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in
addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Condition, Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in _clause (e)_
or (g) of _Annex I_ , (F) otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of
the Offer in a manner that adversely affects any holder of Shares in its
capacity as such, (G) terminate the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise
change the Expiration Date, in each case, except as provided in _Section
1.1(c)_ or _1.1(d)_ or (H) provide any "subsequent offering period" (or any
extension thereof) within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the
Exchange Act. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or
any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 8_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) **Expiration and Extension of the Offer**. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) following the Offer Commencement
Date (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date or such subsequent date to which
the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties
respective termination rights under _Section 8_: (i) if, as of the then-
scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived by Purchaser or Parent, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or
Parent, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer
for additional periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to
permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; and (ii) Purchaser shall, and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for any
period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of
the SEC, the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser (1) be required to extend the
Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8_ and (y) the End Date (such earlier
occurrence, the " _Extension Deadline_ ") or (2) be permitted to extend the
Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the
Company.

 



 

(d) **Termination of Offer**. Nothing in this _Section 1.1_ shall be deemed
to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8_. In
the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8_,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately, irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares
pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall immediately
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

(e) **Offer Documents**. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") that
will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase, form of the
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, (ii) make all
deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act and (iii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer
Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to (x) comply in
all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal
Requirements and (y) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied
by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments (including oral

 



      
 

 



 

comments) of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to promptly
cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Legal Requirements. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion
of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or
Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Company and the
Companys stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(e)_. The Company
and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent
and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments
(including oral comments) Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of those comments (including oral comments).

 



 

(f) **Funds**. Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.11_, Parent
shall cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the funds
necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(g) **Adjustments**. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

(h) **Acceptance**. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent
waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the
Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) (i)
immediately after the Expiration Date irrevocably accept for payment all
Shares tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of
such acceptance, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) as promptly as
practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time (and in any event within three (3)
business days) pay for such Shares.

 



 

 **1.2 Company Actions**.

 



 

(a) **Schedule 14D-9**. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, following the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall (i) file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, shall reflect the
Company Board Recommendation and include the fairness opinion of the Companys
financial advisor referenced in _Section 3.22_ and the notice and other
information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (ii) cause the
Schedule 14D-9 and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares
as and to the extent required by applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Legal Requirements, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the
record date for purposes of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2)
of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (x)
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Legal Requirements and (y) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its
staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent
and Purchaser shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the
Company or the Companys legal counsel all information concerning Parent or
Purchaser that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any
action contemplated by this _Section 1.2(a)_. Parent and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
(including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC
or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments made
by Parent or its counsel. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel
with any comments (including oral comments) the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after receipt of those comments (including oral comments).

 



 

(b) **Stockholder Lists**. The Company shall promptly after the date hereof
furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer
and the Merger (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the
Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, which date
shall not be more than ten (10) business days prior to the date the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder
List Date_ "). Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Purchaser and
their agents shall hold in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement the information contained in any such labels, listings and files.

 



 

(c) **Share Registry**. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by
Purchaser effective immediately after the Offer Acceptance Time.

 ** _MERGER TRANSACTION_**

 



 

 **2.1 Merger of Purchaser into the Company**. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Section
251(h) of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
consummate the Merger, whereby Purchaser shall be merged with and into the
Company, the separate existence of Purchaser shall cease, and the Company will
continue as the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **2.2 Effect of the Merger**. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property,

liabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and

 **2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers**.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action, be amended and
restated to read in its entirety as set forth on _Annex II_ and, as so amended

references to the name of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) As of the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Surviving

and officers of Purchaser as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, until

to the Effective Time shall execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or
her resignation as a member of the Board of Directors to be effective as of
the Effective Time.

 



 

 **2.5 Conversion of Shares**.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of the
Company:

 



 

(i) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company (or
held in the Companys treasury) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(ii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent,
Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(iii) except as provided in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above and subject to
_Section 2.5(b)_, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Dissenting Shares, which shall have only those rights set
forth in _Section 2.7_) shall be converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in each case without any
interest thereon and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with
_Section 2.6(e)_; and

 



 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each applicable holder of such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 2.6_.

 



 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of

 



      
 

 



 

shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

 **2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Offer
Price to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
_Section 1.1(b)_ and to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders
of Shares to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_. Promptly after
(and in any event no later than the third business day after) the Offer
Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate
Offer Price payable pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ (together with the amount deposited pursuant the
immediately preceding sentence, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer Price
in the Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger. The Payment
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that such investments shall be (w) in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, (x) in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (y) in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, or (z) in money market funds having a rating in
the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency
at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such
case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. To
the extent Parent becomes aware that (i) there are any losses with respect to
any such investments or (ii) the Payment Fund has diminished for any reason
below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment
pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_ and _Section 2.5_, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times during the
duration of the Payment Fund, maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying
Agent to make such payments pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_ and _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
(i) Shares represented by a certificate evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who, in each case was entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_, (A) a form of
letter of transmittal, which shall be in reasonable and customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.6(f)_, if
applicable) to the Paying Agent, or a customary agents message in respect to
Book-Entry Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to _Section 2.5_.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu

 



      
 

 



 

thereof in accordance with _Section 2.6(f)_, if applicable) or Book-Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal in the case of Certificates,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the
instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof.
If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing
the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other
similar Taxes described in this _Section 2.6(b)_ under any circumstance.
Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.6_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (with
respect to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_) which had been made available to
the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent
in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving
Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided

 



      
 

 



 

herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser, and
their Affiliates, the Paying Agent or the Depository Agent, as the case may
be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and
withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under any Legal
Requirement with respect to Taxes. Any amounts so deducted and withheld and,
if required, paid over to the applicable Governmental Body, shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder,
claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not
exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the
Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)_), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Section 2_.

 



 

 **2.7 Dissenters Rights**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held
by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
and have properly exercised their respective demands for appraisal of such
Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of
the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights
to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "),
shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be automatically cancelled and no longer
outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be entitled to only such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less
any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section
2.6(e)_), and such Shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, in each case prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall
have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands, and the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent and Purchaser, settle or offer to settle, or make
any payment with respect to, any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any
such demands or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 



       
 

 



 

 **2.8 Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units**.

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, each vested Company Option
that is then outstanding and unexercised (including each vested or unvested
Company Option held by a non-employee director of the Company) and which has a
per share exercise price that is less than the Offer Price (each, a " _Vested
In the Money Option_ ") shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Offer Price over (B)
the exercise price payable per Share under such Vested In the Money Option,
multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Vested In the
Money Option immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, each then outstanding
Company Restricted Stock Unit held by a non-employee director of the Company
(a " _Director Restricted Stock Unit_ ") shall fully vest and be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A)
the Offer Price, multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares subject to such
Director Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



 

(c) Immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, each Company Option other
than a Vested In the Money Option that is then outstanding and unexercised,
whether or not vested, shall be assumed and converted into an option to
purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted
Option_ "), on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as were
applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time multiplied by
(ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded
down to the next lower whole number of shares. The exercise price per share of
such Adjusted Option shall be equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price
per Share subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time divided by (B) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any
fractional cents rounded up to the next higher number of whole cents. The
exercise price per share of any such Adjusted Option and the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock relating to any such Adjusted Option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code, and, in the case of Company Options that are intended to qualify as
incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code.

 



 

(d) Immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, each then outstanding
Company Restricted Stock Unit that is not a Director Restricted Stock Unit
shall be assumed and converted into a restricted stock unit denominated in
shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit_ "),
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company
Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time
(including applicable performance vesting conditions), and relating to a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower
whole number of shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time (but no
later than the later of (i) the first (1st) payroll date following the Offer
Acceptance Time and (ii) the date that is five (5) business days following the
Offer Acceptance Time), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and
the Surviving Corporation shall, pay the aggregate consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.8(a) and _Section 2.8(b), net of any applicable
withholding Taxes, payable with respect to the Vested In the Money Options and
Director Restricted Stock Units through the Surviving Corporations payroll to
the holders of Vested In the Money Options and Director Restricted Stock
Units.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
that are necessary and appropriate (under the Company Equity Plan and award
agreements pursuant to which Vested in the Money Options, Company Options,
Director Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted Stock Units are
outstanding or otherwise) to effect the transactions described in this
_Section 2.8_.

 



 

(g) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall use its best efforts to
provide for the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.8_.
Parent shall prepare and, at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, file with
the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective
amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the Securities
Act, with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Adjusted
Options and Adjusted Restricted Stock Units.

 



 

 **2.9 Further Action**. The Parties agree to take all necessary action to
cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with this _Section 2_ as
soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer without a meeting
of the Companys stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If,
at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is reasonably
determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully
authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and
otherwise) to take such action.

 



 

 **2.10 Company Warrants**. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
any holder of a Company Warrant, the holder of each Company Warrant that is
issued, unexpired and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall, upon the terms and conditions specified in the applicable Company
Warrant and in lieu of Shares immediately theretofore purchasable and
receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented by the Company Warrant,
be entitled to receive upon the exercise thereof the cash payments required to
be paid pursuant to such Company Warrant.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 3**

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows

section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the
particular Section or subsection in this _Section 3_; (b) any exception or
disclosure set forth in any other section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure that such exception or disclosure is applicable to qualify
such representation and warranty; and (c) disclosure in the Company SEC
Documents filed since January 1, 2016 and publicly available prior to the date

Subsidiaries, no Acquired Company owns, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock or equity interests in, or subscriptions, options, calls, warrants or
rights (whether or not currently exercisable) to acquire, or other securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or
equity interests of any Entity.

under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The Board of
Directors has (a) approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for the
Company to enter into this Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, (c) resolved that the Merger

duly executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming due authorization,

the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights, and by general equitable principles. If the
Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL as
contemplated hereby, no vote of the Companys stockholders or any holder of
Shares is necessary to authorize or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions.

 



 

 **3.5 SEC Filings; Financial Statements**.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2016, the Company has filed or furnished on a timely
basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed
or furnished by the Company with the SEC (as supplemented, modified or amended
since the time of filing, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective dates, or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of (and giving effect to) the last such amendment (and, in the case
of registration statements and proxy statements, on the date of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2001, as amended
(the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to those Company SEC
Documents, and, except to the extent that information contained in such
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior
to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes and schedules)
contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form
10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly
presented, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as
of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows
of the Company for the periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of the
unaudited financial statements, to the absence of notes and to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material).

 



 

(c) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) which is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys system of
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2016, and, except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, that assessment concluded that those controls were
effective. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2017, neither the
Company nor the Companys independent registered accountant has identified or
been made aware of: (1) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the
design or operation of the internal control over financial reporting utilized
by the Company, which is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; or (2)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the management or other
employees of the Company who have a significant role in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting.

 



 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in and
required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in the
Companys reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the principal executive
officer of the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to
make the certifications required

 



      
 

 



 

under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The Company is in
compliance in all material respects with all current listing and corporate
governance requirements of NASDAQ.

 



 

(e) The Company is not a party to, nor does it have any obligation or other
commitment to become a party to, "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the
Company SEC Documents.

 



 

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company
SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or
investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending or
threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company,
except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(g) Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in
connection with the Offer, including the Schedule 14D-9 (the " _Company
Disclosure Documents_ "), and any amendments or supplements thereto, when
filed, distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders, as
applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company Disclosure Documents,
at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Documents or any
supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and at the time such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments thereto are first
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

 



 

(i) The information with respect to the Company that the Company furnishes to
Parent or Purchaser specifically for use in the Offer Documents, at the time
of the filing of and at the time of any distribution or dissemination of the
Offer Documents, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Company Disclosure Documents.

_provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be conducted at Parents
expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate personnel
of the Acquired Companies and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Acquired Companies.
Nothing herein shall require any of the Acquired Companies to disclose any
information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its reasonable discretion
and after notice to Parent (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege (so long as the Acquired Companies have reasonably cooperated with
Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis
that does not waive such privilege with respect thereto) or (ii) contravene

 



      
 

 



 

any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract (so long as the Acquired
Companies have reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit disclosure to the
extent permitted by Legal Requirements or the contractual counterparty);
_provided_ , _however_ , in the case of _clause (ii)_ , that the Parties shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to
the extent doing so could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Company
(after consultation with outside counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of Parent could be provided access to such information. With
respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.1_, Parent
shall comply with, and shall instruct Parents Representatives to comply with,
all of its obligations under the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement, effective
as of February 10, 2017, as amended on August 20, 2017, between the Company
and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) (i) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other of (A) any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Body in connection
with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions; or (B) any
Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened in writing
against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Offer, the Merger
or any other Transaction.

 



 

(ii) (A) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change,
circumstance, condition, development, effect, event, occurrence or state of
facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, or would reasonably be expected to make the satisfaction of any of the
Offer Conditions impossible or unlikely, and (B) Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company of any change, circumstance, condition, development,
effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or would reasonably be
expected to make the satisfaction of any of the Offer Conditions impossible or
unlikely.

 



 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.1(b)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party. The
failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any Offer Condition or any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 7_ or give rise to any right to
terminate under _Section 8_.

 



 

 **5.2 Operation of the Companys Business**. During the Pre-Closing Period,
except (x) as expressly required by this Agreement or as required by
applicable Legal Requirements, (y) with the written consent of Parent (which

respective commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) conduct its business in the

direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, or (2) repurchase,
redeem or otherwise reacquire any of the Shares, or any rights, warrants or
options to acquire any of the Shares, other than: (A) repurchases of Shares
outstanding as of the date hereof pursuant to the Companys right (under

Company; (B) repurchases of Company Options or Company Restricted Stock Units

Plans (or any plan, program, arrangement or agreement that would be an
Employee Plan if it were in existence on the date hereof) or grant any

operations.

 



 

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to enter into any transaction, take any action or acquire or
dispose of any of its assets or securities if such transaction, action,
acquisition or disposition would or would reasonably be expected to materially
impair, prevent or materially delay Parents or Purchasers ability to
consummate the Transactions in a timely manner on the terms set forth herein
(and have not since January 1, 2017 entered into any such transaction, taken
any such action or made any suction acquisition or disposition).

 



 

 **5.3 No Solicitation**.

 



 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.3_, during the Pre-Closing Period
the Acquired Companies shall not, and shall cause their officers and directors
not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) continue any solicitation,
knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may
be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) (A) solicit, initiate
or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-
public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (other than discussions solely to clarify the terms and
conditions of such proposal or offer), (B) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other Person any non-public information in connection with, or for the purpose
of soliciting or knowingly encouraging or facilitating, an Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to

prohibit such discussion), (C) approve, adopt, endorse or recommend or enter
into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or
similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal

hereof, the Company shall request the prompt return or destruction (to the
extent provided for by the applicable confidentiality agreement) of all
information or documents previously furnished to any Person (other than
Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) that has made,
has indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal and all material
incorporating such information created by any such Person.

 



 

(b) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time any Acquired Company or any of their Representatives
receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group
of Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was made on or after the date of this
Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.3_,
and the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Offer and that the failure to take such action described in _clauses (x)_ and
_(y)_ below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Acquired Companies to the Person
or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that
the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours) provide to Parent any information concerning the Acquired Companies
that is provided to any Person to the extent access to such information was
not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives; and (y) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group
of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , in the case of
_clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ , that at or prior to the first time that the Company
furnishes any information to or participates in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person on or after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such determination in good
faith of the Board of Directors as provided for above. The Company shall
provide Parent with an accurate and complete copy of any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_ for
informational purposes only within 48 hours of execution thereof.

 



 

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal are received by any Acquired Company or any
of their Representatives and provide to Parent a copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal (including any proposed term sheet, letter of intent,
acquisition agreement or other agreement or other supporting materials with
respect thereto) and a summary of any material unwritten terms and conditions
thereof (and indicate the identity of such Person), and (ii) keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within
24 hours of such material development, discussion or negotiation).

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company any
"stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from taking and disclosing such other position or
disclosure as is required under Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from taking any action

 



      
 

 



 

necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Board of Directors shall not effect a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 6.1_.

 



 

 **SECTION 6**

 



 

 ** _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES_**

 



 

 **6.1 Company Board Recommendation**.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion
of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.
During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, neither the Board

scheduled date of the Offer Acceptance Time), _provided_ , that Parent may
only make such request once with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (
_provided_ , that each time a Determination Notice is given Parent shall,
subject to the following provision, be entitled to make a new such request);
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide
any such affirmation during the two (2) or four (4) business day periods, as

commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the Shares by a
Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to publicly affirm the Company Board
Recommendation and recommend that the Companys stockholders reject such
tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business days after the

business day immediately preceding the scheduled date of the Offer Acceptance

to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or cause or allow the Company to
execute or enter into any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle or term sheet with respect to, or that
is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Transactions
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and subject to compliance with
the other provisions of this _Section 6.1_:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) if any Acquired Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in
good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Board
of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) provided
that no Acquired Company is in breach of _Section 5.3_ in any material
respect and in a manner that led to such Acquisition Proposal and subject to
the other provisions of _Section 8.1(e)_, the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ to enter into a Specified Agreement
with respect to such Superior Offer, in each case, if and only if: (A) the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under
applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior
written notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ at
least four (4) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change

shall not constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination)
and, if requested in writing by Parent during such four (4)-business day
period, shall have negotiated, and caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
another proposal to the extent proposed by Parent so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer; and (C) (1) the Company
shall have provided to Parent information with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_, as well as a copy of any
acquisition agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of
any financing commitments relating thereto (or, if not provided in writing to
the Company, a written summary of the material terms thereof), (2) the Company
shall have given Parent the four (4)-business day period after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Offer, and (3) after giving effect to the proposals made
by Parent during such period, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_ would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look
and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, taking and disclosing a position
or otherwise making any disclosure as is required under Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
otherwise complying with applicable Legal Requirements shall not, in and of
itself, be considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not
require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures
set forth in this _Section 6.1_. The provisions of this _Section 6.1(b)(i)_
shall also apply to any change to any of the financial terms (including the
form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or other material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice (
_provided_ that for the purposes of such subsequent Determination Notice, all
references to "four (4) business days" shall be deemed to be "two (2) business
days"); and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall be subject to
_Section 6.1(b)(i)_), the Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if: (A) the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice
at least four (4) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse
Change Recommendation and, if desired by Parent, during such four (4)-business
day period shall have negotiated, and caused its Representatives to negotiate,
in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
another proposal to the extent proposed by Parent so that a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation would no longer be necessary; and (C) (1) the Company
shall have specified in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances that
render a Company Adverse Change Recommendation necessary, (2) the Company
shall have given Parent the four (4)-business day period after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal so that a Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no
longer be necessary, and (3) after giving effect to the proposals made by
Parent during such period, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under
applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions of this _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_
shall also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances
specified by the Company pursuant to _clause (C)(1)_ above and require a new
Determination Notice ( _provided_ that for the purposes of such subsequent
Determination Notice, all references to "four (4) business days" shall be
deemed to be "two (2) business days").

 



 

 **6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals**.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take promptly
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under the Antitrust Laws, that may be asserted by any Governmental Body, so as
to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, but in no case
later than the End Date, including providing as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable all non-legally privileged information required by
any Governmental Body pursuant to its evaluation of the Transactions under the
HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws. Subject to the terms of this
Section 6.2, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
from any Governmental Body all consents, approvals authorizations or orders
required to be obtained under the Antitrust Laws or to avoid the entry or
enactment of any injunction or other order or decree relating to any Antitrust
Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and its
Affiliates shall not be required to, and without the prior written consent of
Parent the Acquired Companies shall not, sell, license, divest or dispose of
or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) or agree
to any other structural, behavioral or conduct remedy, before or after the
Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, any entities, businesses,
divisions, operations, products or product lines, assets, Intellectual
Property Rights or businesses of Parent, the Acquired Companies (or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) or agree to any restriction
on the conduct of such businesses which (A) would

 



      
 

 



 

materially and adversely affect the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (B) would require the sale, license, divestiture,
disposal, or holding separate of, or any other structural, behavioral or
conduct remedy involving the Key Products. Nothing in this _Section 6.2
_shall require the Parent or the Acquired Companies to take or agree to take
any action unless the effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent, Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or
participate in the litigation of any action, whether judicial or
administrative, brought by any Governmental Body challenging or seeking to
restrain, prohibit or place conditions on the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to): (i) as
promptly as reasonably practicable, make an appropriate filing of all
Notification and Report forms as required by the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws, with respect to the Transactions and (ii) cooperate with each
other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other
filings, notifications or other consents are required to be made with, or
obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the
Transactions.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.2_, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall (i) give the other
Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or
brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case, with
respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws, (ii) keep the other

of the Parties, control and direct all aspects of the Parties efforts to
obtain the required approvals under the Antitrust Laws, including having
principal responsibility for devising, implementing, and making the final
determination as to the appropriate strategy

 



      
 

 



 

relating to any matters relating to the Antitrust Laws, including with respect
to any filings, notifications, submissions and communications with or to any
Governmental Body, and shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
determine the nature and timing of any divestitures or other remedial
undertakings made for the purpose of securing any required approvals under the
Antitrust Laws to the extent any such divestitures or other remedial
undertakings would be conditioned upon and only be effective after the

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall to the extent permissible
under applicable Legal Requirements and reasonably practicable and where doing
so would not reasonably be expected to impair or adversely affect the Company,

faith by the Company) (i) offer Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company prior to any proposed material meeting or other material communication
with the FDA, EMA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (" _CMS_ ") or
any other Governmental Body relating to any Product or material Governmental
Authorization (it being understood that in no event shall the Company be

or on behalf of any Acquired Company, and any material correspondence or other

initiating, or making any material change to, commercialization and
reimbursement activities or materials (including promotional and marketing
activities and materials) relating to any Product. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of any significant data relating to the Key Products, including
information related to any significant adverse events with respect to the Key

 **6.3 Employee Benefits**. For a period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the later of (x) the one (1)-year anniversary of the Effective Time
or (y) December 31, 2018, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
those employees of the Acquired Companies who are employed by the Acquired
Companies as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be
actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof)
during such period (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) the base salary
or wage rate and bonus opportunities (including annual bonus opportunities,
but excluding equity-based compensation) that are, in each case, no less than
those provided by the relevant Acquired Company immediately prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, (ii) pension and welfare benefits that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than those provided by the relevant Acquired Company

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and (iii) severance benefits
that are no less favorable than the severance benefits set forth in _Section
6.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the foregoing:

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit plans
(to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to participate
under the health and welfare benefit plans of the relevant Acquired Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that (i)
nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such
health or welfare benefit plan at any time and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan (upon
expiration of any appropriate transition period), then the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporations (or
an Affiliates) health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage
under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time. To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual under any benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation, then Parent shall ensure that such benefit plan shall, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual, credit Continuing
Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its
Affiliates or their respective predecessors to the same extent that such
service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding
benefit plan of the Company or other Acquired Company. Nothing in this
_Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
right in any Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation or to any compensation or
benefits and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment.

 



 

(b) To the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, with respect
to any employee benefit plans maintained for the benefit of the Continuing
Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, any of its Affiliates, and any successor thereto, to
(i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the same extent waived
under comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and (ii) give
effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, amounts paid by such employees during the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs under similar plans maintained by the Acquired
Companies.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor
thereto to, honor, fulfill and discharge the Acquired Companies obligations
under the agreements identified in _Section 6.3(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. During the period commencing on the Offer Acceptance Time and ending
on December 31, 2017, Parent agrees to comply with the requirements set forth
in Schedule 6.3(c).

 



 

(d) The Company may determine prior to the Offer Acceptance Time the amount
earned by each participant of the Acquired Companies annual incentive plans,
in an amount up to the greater of target performance and the Companys actual
performance for the 2017 fiscal year, with such amount to be paid to each
eligible participant in the ordinary course

 



      
 

 



 

of business consistent with past practice following the end of the 2017 fiscal
year; _provided_ that any such participant whose employment is terminated by
the Surviving Corporation without Cause or who resigns for Good Reason, in
each case following the Effective Time but prior to the date such
participants bonus amount would otherwise be paid, shall be entitled to
receive his or her earned bonus amount in a lump-sum payment promptly
following the date his or her termination of employment. For purposes of this
_Section 6.3(d)_, "Cause" and "Good Reason" shall have the meanings ascribed
to such terms in the Company Severance Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate in the
Parent annual bonus plan commencing in 2018.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors shall take the
action described on _Section 6.3(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties, and no provision of this _Section 6.3_ is intended to, or shall,
constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee
benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former
employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right
to enforce the provisions hereof.

 



 

 **6.4 ESPP**. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all actions as may be required under the
Company ESPP to provide that (a) the "Offering" (as defined in the Company
ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall be the final Offering
(such period, the " _Final Offering_ ") and no further Offering shall commence
pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, and (b) each
individual participating in the Final Offering on the date of this Agreement
shall not be permitted to (i) increase his or her payroll contribution rate
pursuant to the Company ESPP from the rate in effect when the Final Offering
commenced or (ii) make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP
on or following the date of this Agreement, except as may be required by
applicable Legal Requirement. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company
shall take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the Offer
Acceptance Time, (A) cause the Final Offering, to the extent that it would
otherwise be outstanding at the Offer Acceptance Time, to be terminated no
later than five (5) business days prior to the date on which the Offer
Acceptance Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata adjustments that may be
necessary to reflect the Final Offering, but otherwise treat the Final
Offering as a fully effective and completed Offering for all purposes pursuant
to the Company ESPP; and (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than five (5)
business days prior to the date on which the Offer Acceptance Time occurs) of
each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the Company ESPP. On such exercise
date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to
the Company ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the
purchase of Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each
Share shall be an outstanding Share and entitled to the Merger Consideration.
The Company shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to terminate the
Company ESPP effective as of immediately prior to, and conditional upon the
occurrence of, the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors**.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees that
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of any
Acquired Company and any indemnification or other similar agreements of any
Acquired Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and
Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies to perform their obligations
thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall and shall cause the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries to agree that they will, indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of any Acquired
Company or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of any Acquired
Company as a director or officer of another Person (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of any Acquired Company or
is or was serving at the request of any Acquired Company as a director or
officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x)
each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred
in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with
the organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that any Indemnified
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporations or any of its
Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) or any such indemnification or other similar
agreements, as applicable, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final adjudication that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
to indemnification and (y) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any
such matter.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Acquired Companies or provide
substitute policies for the Acquired Companies and their current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Acquired Companies, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage
and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability

 



      
 

 



 

insurance coverage currently maintained by the Acquired Companies with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M.
Best with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies an annual premium greater than 300% of the aggregate annual premium
most recently paid by the Acquired Companies prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 6.5(b)_ it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six
(6)-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such
insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability
insurance policy for the Acquired Companies and their current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Acquired Companies, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less
than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Acquired
Companies with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at
or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of
any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Acquired Company or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Acquired Company, as
applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of such Acquired Company assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.5_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ (i) shall survive the acceptance of
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Persons), his or
her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and (iii) are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal
Requirement, this _Section 6.5_ may not be amended, altered or repealed after
the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without
the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

 



 

 **6.6 Stockholder Litigation**. In the event that any litigation related to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions is brought by
any stockholder or other holder of Company securities (whether directly or on
behalf of the Company or otherwise) against the Company and/or its directors
or officers, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and shall keep Parent
reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company shall give Parent the (a) opportunity to participate in the defense of
any such litigation, (b) right to review and comment on all material filings
or responses to be made by the Company in

 



       
 

 



 

connection with such litigation (and shall give due consideration to Parents
comments and other advice with respect to such litigation) and (c) right to
consult on any settlement with respect to such litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent be required to consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) to any such settlement that does not provide for the
unconditional release of Parent, its Affiliates and Representatives and all
Persons entitled to indemnification by Parent or the Company, in each case
from any liability in connection with such litigation; _provided further_ ,
that the Company shall otherwise control the defense and/or settlement and the
disclosure of information in connection therewith shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.1_, including regarding attorney-client privilege or
other applicable legal privilege.

 



 

 **6.7 Additional Agreements**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including _Section 6.2(a)_, Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall use
reasonable best efforts to (a) make all filings (if any) and give all notices
(if any) required to be made and given by such Party pursuant to any Material
Contract in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other
Transactions to the extent requested in writing by Parent, (b) seek each
Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any Material Contract by
such Party in connection with the Transactions to the extent requested in

legal bar to the Offer or the Merger brought by any third Person against such
Party.

thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing
any further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement or
making any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release, public statement or announcement to Company
Associates without the other Partys written consent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any
public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such
statements substantially reiterate (and are not inconsistent with) previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the
parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party); (b) a Party may,
without the prior consent of the other Party but subject to giving advance
notice to the other Party and consulting with the other Party with respect to
the content thereof, issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement or statement that, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
is determined to be required by Legal Requirement or by any listing agreement
with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market,
including NASDAQ or NYSE; (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in
connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing

Companys obligations under _Section 5.3_ or _Section 6.1_).

 



 

 **6.9 Takeover Laws**. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members
of their respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so

of the Offer Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed disposition and
cancellation of Shares, Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units in
the Merger by applicable individuals and to cause such dispositions and/or
cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 



 

 **6.11 Rule 14d-10 Matters**. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the compensation committee
of the Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, will approve, as
an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each

respective Representatives shall be required to take any action under any such

any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs that will be
reimbursed by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.14_) or incur any other
liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing or any of the foregoing that would be effective prior to the

judgments, penalties, settlements, costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) suffered or incurred by them to the extent such losses,
damages, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, settlements, costs or
expenses arose out of the actions taken by the Company, its subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.14_ (other than
information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in writing for express use therein), except in the event such
losses, damages, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, settlements,
costs or expenses are determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction to have arisen out of or resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Purchaser

pay for the tendered Shares and consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions as provided herein, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
Offer Conditions or the conditions set forth in _Section 7_, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the condition set
forth in clause (c) of _Annex I_ , as it applies to the Companys obligations
pursuant to this _Section 6.14_, shall be deemed satisfied.

 **8.1 Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or prior to midnight Eastern Time, on December 27, 2017 (the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of this _Section 8.1(b)_, (x) if on
the End Date all of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ , other than _clause
(e)_ or (g) (solely in respect of the HSR Act) set forth in _Annex I_ shall
have been satisfied or waived by Parent or Purchaser, to the extent waivable
by Parent or Purchaser (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, each of which is then capable of being
satisfied), then the End Date shall automatically be extended by a period of
ninety (90) days (and all references to the End Date herein and in _Annex I_
shall be as so extended) and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose
willful and material breach of covenants in this Agreement has caused or
resulted in the Offer not being consummated by such date;

jurisdiction shall have issued an order, injunction, decree or ruling, or
shall have taken any other action, having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or making the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall
be final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose material breach of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement has caused or resulted in such final and nonappealable order,
injunction, decree, ruling or other action;

 



 

(d) by Parent, if the Board of Directors shall have effected a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation;

 



 

(e) by the Company, if the Board of Directors has made a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation in order to accept a Superior Offer (in compliance with
the terms of this Agreement, including _Section 6.1(b)_) and concurrently
enter into a binding written definitive acquisition agreement providing for
the consummation of a transaction which the Board of Directors shall have
determined, in good faith and pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_, constitutes a

5.3_ in any material respect, (ii) the Company and the Board of Directors
shall have complied with _Section 6.1(b)_ and (iii) the Company shall have
paid the Termination Fee immediately before and as a condition to such
termination;

 



 

(f) by Parent, if a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement
on the part of the Company shall have occurred such that a condition set forth
in _clause (b)_ or _(c)_ of _Annex I_ would not be satisfied and cannot be
cured by the Company by the End Date, or if capable of being cured in such
time period, shall not have been cured within forty-five (45) days of the date
Parent gives the Company written notice of such breach or failure to perform;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ if either Parent or
Purchaser is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation hereunder; or

 



 

(g) by the Company, if (i) a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser shall have occurred, in
each case, if such breach or failure would reasonably be expected to prevent
Parent or Purchaser from consummating the Transactions and such breach or
failure cannot be cured by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, by the End
Date, or, if capable of being cured in such time period, shall not have been
cured within forty-five (45) days of the date the Company gives Parent written
notice of such breach or failure to perform; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(g)_ if the Company is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation hereunder; or (ii) Purchaser
fails to commence the Offer on or prior to the tenth (10th) business day
following the date of this Agreement or if Purchaser fails to consummate the
Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **8.2 Effect of Termination**. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates
following any such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the final
sentence of _Section 1.2(b)_, the final sentence of _Section 5.1(a)_,
_Section 6.14(b)_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Section 9_ (other than _Section
9.5(b)_) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in
full force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms and (c) except as set forth in _Section 8.3_, the
termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability
for fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement prior to
termination.

 



 

 **8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees**.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.14(b)_ and this _Section 8.3_, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or
not the Offer and Merger are consummated.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_,
the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same day funds prior to or simultaneously with (and as a condition
to the effectiveness of) such termination;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, the
Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same day funds within one (1) business day after such termination;
or

 



 

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at
such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement
pursuant to the proviso to _Section 8.1(b)_) or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_ resulting from a willful and material breach of any covenant
in this Agreement (y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal, or such Acquisition Proposal has otherwise been
communicated to the Board of Directors or the Companys stockholders and shall
have become publicly known, after the date hereof and prior to such
termination and such Acquisition Proposal has not been unconditionally
withdrawn prior to such termination and (z) within twelve (12) months of such
termination the Board of Directors shall have approved or recommended any
Acquisition Proposal (regardless of when made), and the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
which shall have been consummated ( _provided_ that for purposes of this
_clause (z)_ the references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), the Company shall pay to
Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds
prior to the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) It is understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, " _Termination Fee_
" shall mean a cash amount equal to $356,000,000. Payment of the Termination
Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ shall be deemed to be liquidated damages
for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment
thereof) or

 



      
 

 



 

any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge (i) that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the circumstances in which such
payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions and (iii) that,
without this _Section 8.3_, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences a
Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company, the Company
shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received.

 



 

 **SECTION 9**

 

 ** **

 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_**

 



 

 **9.1 Amendment**. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, this Agreement may be
amended with the approval of the respective Boards of Directors of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser at any time; _provided_ that, following the
consummation of the Offer, this Agreement may not be amended in any manner
that causes the Merger Consideration to differ from the Offer Price. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

 **9.2 Waiver**. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy. No single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or
remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party and any such waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure. At any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent and
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other, (b) waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive
compliance by the other with any of the agreements or covenants

 



      
 

 



 

contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of the Party or Parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. The rights and remedies provided
herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by any Legal Requirement except to the extent set forth in _Section
8.3(d)_.

 



 

 **9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties**. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

 



 

 **9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts**. This Agreement (including its
Exhibits, Annexes and the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties
and their respective Affiliates, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement except that the restrictions on contact and
restrictions on disclosure (to the extent to be included in SEC filings in
connection with the Transactions) in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement
solely for purposes of permitting the actions contemplated hereby to be
consummated. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, including by
facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments, all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

 



 

 **9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if (but only
if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District
Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware and any appellate
court therefrom (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "); and (ii) each of
the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with _Section 9.9_. Each
of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally (1) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in the Delaware Courts, (2) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in the Delaware Courts, (3) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the
Delaware Courts and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding in the Delaware Courts. The Parties agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in _Section 9.5(a)_ without proof of damages or otherwise,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific performance is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy
at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section 9.5(b)_ shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY
HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF. EACH PARTY (I) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

 



 

 **9.6 Assignability**. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned by a
Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided further_ , _however_ , that
Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned
direct or indirect Delaware corporate Subsidiary of Parent to act as
Purchaser, in which event all references to Purchaser in this Agreement shall
be deemed references to such other Subsidiary; _provided_ such assignment
shall not impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or relieve
Parent of its obligations hereunder.

 



       
 

 



 

 **9.7** ** ****No Third Party Beneficiaries**. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than
the Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement; except for: (a) if the Offer Acceptance Time occurs,
(i) the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Offer Price or
Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 1_ or _Section 2_
following the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as applicable, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the right of the holders
of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units to receive the
applicable treatment pursuant to _Section 2.8_ following the Offer Acceptance
Time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and (b) the provisions
set forth in _Section 6.5_ of this Agreement with respect to the Persons
referred to therein.

 



 

 **9.8** ** ****Transfer Taxes**. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
2.6(b)_, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar Taxes and fees imposed on the Company with respect to the transfer of
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger shall be borne by the Company and
expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Shares, expressly excluding
any such Taxes imposed on the holders of Shares. The Company shall cooperate
with Purchaser and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns
with respect to such Taxes.

 



 

 **9.9** ** ****Notices**. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any Party under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon
receipt when delivered by hand, (b) two (2) business days after being sent by
registered mail or by courier or express delivery service, or (c) upon
confirmation of successful transmission if sent by email followed up within
one (1) business day by dispatch pursuant to one of the other described
herein; _provided_ that in each case the notice or other communication is sent

 **9.10** ** ****Severability**. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree
that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit such
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term
or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 



 

 **9.11** ** ****Obligation of Parent**. Parent shall ensure that Purchaser
duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a timely basis each of the

(b) The Parties agree that any rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not be applied
in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." As used in
this Agreement, when the word "material" is used in a representation or
covenant as applied to the Company, it shall be deemed to apply to the
Acquired Companies taken as a whole as the context requires.

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Exhibits" or "Annexes" are intended to refer to Sections of this
Agreement and Exhibits or Annexes to this Agreement.

made on and as of the Offer Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such
representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date or period, in
which case as of such date or period), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

the obligations, covenants and agreements it is required to comply with or
perform at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time;

 



 

(d) since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred any change,

pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser, may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions (including
any action or inaction by Parent or Purchaser) and (except for the Minimum
Condition) may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time, in the sole and absolute discretion of Parent and
Purchaser. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.
