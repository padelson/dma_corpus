and approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of
each of Parent and the Company have determined that the Merger is advisable
and in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders and
accordingly have agreed to effect the Merger upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, it is intended that,
for federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization
under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Code");   WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have each entered into
a Stockholders Agreement with Parent with respect to the approval of the
Merger and certain restrictions on the transfer of securities of the Company
and Parent (collectively, the "Stockholders Agreements");   WHEREAS, in
order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain
officers of the Company are simultaneously entering into employment, non-
compete and non-solicitation agreements with Parent to become effective at
the Effective Time (as defined below) (collectively, the "Employment
Agreements"); and   WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   The

subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time

cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger

separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the
"DGCL").   1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place (i) at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell, 1870 Embarcadero Road,

business day) after the last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as
the Company and Parent may agree in writing (the "Closing Date").   1.3.

Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when
the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with and accepted by
the Secretary of State of Delaware (the "Effective Time").     ARTICLE
II   Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws  of the Surviving
Corporation   2.1. The Certificate of Incorporation. The Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the "Charter"), until duly amended as provided therein
or by applicable law, except that Article IV of the Charter shall be amended
to read in its entirety as follows: "The aggregate number of shares that the
Corporation shall have the authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common
Stock, par value $1.00 per share."    -2-   2.2. The By-Laws. The by-
laws of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation (the "By-Laws"), until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable law.     ARTICLE III   Officers and
Directors  of the Surviving Corporation   3.1. Directors. The directors of
Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the By-Laws.  
3.2. Officers. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the By-Laws.     ARTICLE IV   Effect of the Merger on
Capital Stock;  Exchange of Certificates   4.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At
the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective
stockholders:   (a) Merger Consideration. Each share of the Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (a "Share" or, collectively, the
"Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the "Parent Companies") or
Shares that are owned by the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of
the Company and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (each, an
"Excluded Share" and collectively, "Excluded Shares")) shall be converted
into, and become exchangeable for 0.39 shares (the "Exchange Ratio"), of
Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock").
At the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a "Certificate") formerly representing any of such Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to the merger
consideration set forth in this Section 4.1(a) and the right, if any, to
receive pursuant to Section 4.2(d) cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which such Shares have been converted pursuant to this Section 4.1(a).   
-3-   (b) Cancellation of Shares. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to be outstanding, shall be automatically cancelled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.   (c)
Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of Common Stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   4.2. Exchange of
Certificates for Shares.   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
selected by Parent with the Company\'s prior approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and,
after the Effective Time, if applicable, any cash to be paid pursuant to the
last sentence of Section 4.1(a) in exchange for Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time upon due surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IV. Parent will promptly make available to the
Exchange Agent as needed any dividends or distributions with respect to the
merger consideration set forth in Section 4.1(a). Such certificates for
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any cash, dividends or
distributions payable with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund".   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock, (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and (C) any unpaid dividends and distributions as
contemplated by this Article IV. Subject to Section 4.2(h), upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article IV, (y) a check in the amount (after
giving effect to any required tax withholdings) of any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and (z) any unpaid dividends and distributions as
contemplated by this Article IV, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Parent    -4-  Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued and/or paid to such
a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person (as defined below) requesting such exchange
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable.   For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Person" shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in
Section 5.1(d)) or other entity of any kind or nature.   (c) Transfers.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.   (d) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will
be issued and any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock but for this Section 4.2(d) shall be entitled to receive
a cash payment in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of this Section
4.2(d). As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of Parent
Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 4.2(a), over
(ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be
distributed to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2(b)
(such excess, the "Excess Shares"). Following the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock, shall sell
the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the Nasdaq National Market.
The Exchange Agent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as, in
the Exchange Agent\'s reasonable judgment, is practicable consistent with
obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market
conditions. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net
proceeds to which each holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if
any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction
the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to
which such holder of Company Common Stock is entitled (after aggregating
all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such holder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Company Common Stock are entitled. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of Company Common    -5-  Stock with respect to fractional
share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to such
holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section
4.2(b).   (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of their shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash payable pursuant
to Sections 4.1 or 4.2 upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.   (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares
of Parent Common Stock and any cash payable upon due surrender of and
deliverable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant
to this Agreement.   (g) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of
Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is on or after the date of the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include such dividends or other
distributions in respect of all Parent Common Stock issued or issuable
pursuant to Section 4.1(a). No dividends or other distributions declared on
or after the date of the Effective Time, or made on or after the date of the
Effective Time with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time,
with respect to Parent Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with
this Agreement shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate,
and as well no merger consideration shall be paid to any such holder, until
such Certificate is surrendered as provided in this Article IV. Promptly
following the proper surrender of a Certificate, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the Person in whose name Parent Common Stock have been or will
be registered (if and to the extent Parent Common Stock are payable in
respect of such Certificate) any dividends or other distributions with a
record date on or after the date of the Effective Time and which have then
been previously paid, with respect to the number of whole Parent Common Stock
registered in the name of such Person, less the amount of any
withholding taxes that may be required thereon. There shall also be paid to
the holders of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger any dividends or
other distributions with (i) a record date on or after the date of the
Effective Time but prior to the issuance of the respective Parent Common
Stock and (ii) a payment date subsequent    -6-  to the issuance of the
respective Parent Common Stock, at the appropriate payment date for such
dividend or other distribution, less the amount of any withholding taxes
which may be required thereon.   (h) Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any
"affiliate" (as determined pursuant to Section 6.8) of the Company shall not
be exchanged until Parent has received a written agreement from such Person
as provided in Section 6.8 hereof.   4.3. Dissenters\' Rights. In accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to
holders of Shares in connection with the Merger.   4.4. Adjustments to
Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, or
Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common
Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall
be equitably adjusted as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so as to preserve
the economic benefits that Parent and the Company reasonably expected on the
date of this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    
ARTICLE V   Representations and Warranties   5.1. Representations and
Warranties of the Company. Except as set forth in the disclosure letter
delivered to Parent by the Company that is attached to this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") (any matter disclosed in a section or subsection
of the Company Disclosure Letter shall qualify the correspondingly numbered
representation, warranty and covenant of this Agreement and all other
representations, warranties and covenants of the Company in this Agreement
regardless of whether such matter is specifically cross referenced in such
section or subsection so long as the disclosure of such matter is sufficient
as to make its relevance to such other representation, warranty and covenant
readily apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that:   (a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is validly
existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is chartered or organized with full corporate power and authority
to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and
conduct its business as presently conducted, and is duly   
-7-  qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such
qualification except where failure to so qualify or to be in good standing is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has made available to
Parent a complete and correct copy of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
certificates of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date. The
Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' certificates of incorporation and by-laws
so made available are in full force and effect. Section 5.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each jurisdiction
where the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is organized and qualified to
do business.   As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "Subsidiary" means,
with respect to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, any
entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a majority
of the securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons
performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by
such party or by one or more of its respective Subsidiaries or by such party
and any one or more of its respective Subsidiaries and (ii) "Company Material
Adverse Effect" means (x) a material adverse effect on the condition
(financial or otherwise), prospects, business or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (y) an effect that could
prevent or materially burden or materially impair the ability of the Company
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that the following shall be excluded from the definition of "Company
Material Adverse Effect" and from the determination of whether such a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred: (a) the effects of conditions or events
resulting from general financial, political, economic or market conditions
(including the suspension of trading in securities on the Nasdaq National
Market); (b) any change in the trading prices or volumes of the capital stock
of the Company; (c) the effects of conditions or events resulting from an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or
the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or
the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis, including the occurrence of
a terrorist attack; (d) any change resulting from the entry into this
Agreement or the announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the performance of this Agreement and the covenants set forth
herein; and (e) any change resulting from the actions of Parent.   (b)
Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
150,000,000 Shares, of which 60,646,087 Shares were outstanding as of the
close of business on July 5, 2002, and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Shares"), none of which
were outstanding as of the close of business on the date hereof. All of
the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. The Company has no Shares or Preferred Shares
reserved for issuance, except that, as of the date hereof, there were (i)
9,500,000 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company\'s 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan (the "2001 Equity Incentive Plan") and options with respect to
4,591,338    -8-  Shares are currently outstanding under the 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan, (ii) 625,000 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Amended and Restated Company 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2001
ESPP") and no options with respect to Shares are currently outstanding under
the 2001 ESPP, (iii) 4,677,733 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the
X.com Corporation 1999 Stock Plan (the "X.com 1999 Stock Plan") and options
with respect to 1,503,567 Shares are currently outstanding under the X.com
1999 Stock Plan, (iv) 1,207,583 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Confinity, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan (the "Confinity 1999 Plan" and, together with
the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2001 ESPP and the X.com 1999 Stock Plan,
the "Stock Plans") and options with respect to 282,633 Shares are currently
outstanding under the Confinity 1999 Plan, and (v) 125,000 Shares were
reserved for issuance pursuant to warrants issued by the Company (the
"Company Warrants"). The Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list of each outstanding (i) option to purchase Shares under the
Stock Plans or otherwise (each a "Company Option"), including the holder,
date of grant, exercise price and number of Shares subject thereto and the
Stock Plan under which it is issued, (ii) Share of restricted stock which is
still subject to vesting, repurchase or forfeiture, including the holder,
date of grant, vesting schedule and the Stock Plan under which it was issued

of the Code has received or will timely file for a favorable determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and the Company is not
aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter or    -12-  the loss of the qualification
of such Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date

amount which would be material.   (iii) Neither the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any entity which is considered one employer with the Company

Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of
the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year, except for
increases directly resulting from an increase in the number of persons
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries or promotions of existing
employees in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

Letter, neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this

to which its property is subject which violation or default, when taken
together with all other such violations and defaults, could be considered
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) any material Laws of any
court, Governmental Entity, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction
over the Company or such Subsidiary or any of its properties, as applicable.

Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub. Except as set forth in the disclosure
letter delivered to the Company by Parent that is attached to this Agreement
(the "Parent Disclosure Letter") (any matter disclosed in a section or
subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall qualify the correspondingly
numbered representation, warranty and covenant of this Agreement and all
other representations, warranties and covenants of Parent in this Agreement
regardless of whether such matter is specifically cross referenced in such
section or subsection so long as the disclosure of such matter is sufficient
as to make its relevance to such other representation, warranty and covenant
readily apparent), Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant to
the Company that:   (a) Capitalization of Merger Sub. The authorized capital
stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective
Time will be, owned by Parent, and there are (i) no other shares of capital
stock or voting securities of Merger Sub, (ii) no securities of Merger Sub
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting
securities of Merger Sub and (iii) no options or other rights to acquire from
Merger Sub, and no obligations of Merger Sub to issue, any capital stock,
voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital
stock or voting securities of Merger Sub.   (b) Organization, Good Standing
and Qualification. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Parent\'s Significant
Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a
corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is chartered or organized with full corporate power and authority to own or
lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its
business as presently conducted, and is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction which requires such qualification except where failure to
so qualify or to be in good standing is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). Parent has made available to the Company a complete and
correct copy of Parent\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as
amended to the date hereof. Parent\'s and its Significant Subsidiaries\'
certificates of incorporation and by-laws are in full force and effect.
"Significant Subsidiary" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Rule
1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Exchange Act.   As used in
this Agreement, the term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means (x) a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects,
business or results of operations of Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries
taken as a    -21-  whole or (y) an effect that could prevent or
materially burden or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that the following shall be excluded from the definition of "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" and from the determination of whether such a Parent
Material Adverse Effect has occurred: (a) the effects of conditions or events
resulting from general financial, political, economic or market conditions
(including the suspension of trading in securities on the Nasdaq National
Market); (b) any change in the trading prices or volumes of the capital stock
of Parent; (c) the effects of conditions or events resulting from an outbreak
or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration
by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any
other calamity or crisis, including the occurrence of a terrorist attack; (d)
any change resulting from the entry into this Agreement or the announcement
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the performance of this
Agreement and the covenants set forth herein; and (e) any change resulting
from the actions of the Company.   (c) Capital Structure. The authorized
capital stock of Parent consists of 900,000,000 shares of Parent Common
Stock, of which 281,627,707 shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on June 30, 2002, and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock par value
$0.001 per share (the "Parent Preferred Shares"), none of which were
outstanding as of the close of business on the date hereof. All of the
outstanding Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized and are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Parent has no shares of Parent Common
Stock reserved for issuance, except that, as of June 30, 2002, there were
25,158,126 shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to
Parent\'s stock option plans (not including Parent\'s 1998 employee stock
purchase plan) and options with respect to 37,431,071 shares of Parent Common
Stock were outstanding under such plans as of such date. Each of
the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each of
Parent\'s Significant Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of any lien, pledge, security
interest, claim or other encumbrance. Except as set forth above and except as
is not material to the capitalization of Parent, as of the date hereof, there
are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion
rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate Parent to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other
securities of Parent or any securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of Parent, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
Parent does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders
of Parent on any matter.    -22-   (d) Corporate Authority.   (i) No
vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent, as the sole stockholder of the Merger Sub, has taken all
action necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement is a valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.   (ii) The Board of Directors of Parent (A) has approved
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby

Co., to the effect that the consideration to be paid by Parent in the Merger
is fair to Parent from a financial point of view.   (iii) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will have taken all necessary action to permit it to
issue the number of duly authorized shares of Parent Common Stock required to
be issued or issuable pursuant to Article IV and Section 6.11(a). Such Parent
Common Stock, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and no stockholder of Parent will have any preemptive right of
subscription or purchase in respect thereof. Such Parent Common Stock, when
issued, will be registered under the Securities Act and Exchange Act and
registered or exempt from registration under any applicable state securities
or "blue sky" laws.   (e) Governmental Filings; No Violations. (i) Other

HSR Act, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (C) to comply with state
securities or "blue sky" laws, (D) required to be made with the Nasdaq
National Market and (E) to comply with foreign antitrust and unfair
competition laws, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be
made by Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are any consents, registrations,
approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by Parent or
Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity, in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation
by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (ii) The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, result in a   
-23-  breach or violation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance
upon any property or assets of the Parent or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries pursuant to (A) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
the Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or (B) the terms of any
Material Contracts to which Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is
a party or bound or to which it or their property is subject, or (C) any Laws
applicable to Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries of any court,
Governmental Entity, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over
Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of its or their
properties; except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), for such conflict,

Audit Date") in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any
amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, including any such
reports filed subsequent to the date hereof, the "Parent Reports"). As of
their respective dates, the Parent Reports did not, and any Parent Reports
filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Each of the

Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents,
or will fairly present, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income
and consolidated statements of cash flows included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, or will fairly present, the results of operations and cash
flows, as the case may be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods set

effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as may be noted therein.   (g) Absence of Certain
Changes. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, since the Parent Audit Date through the date hereof Parent and its

hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the
officers of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Affiliates or
(ii) obligations or liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed, including those
relating to matters involving any environmental and occupational safety and
health matters, or any other facts or circumstances of which the officers of

or liabilities of, Parent or any of its Affiliates, except for those that are
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially burden or materially impair
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (i) Compliance with Laws. Neither Parent
nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is in violation or default of (i) any
provision of its certificate or by-laws, (ii) the terms of any Material
Contract to which it is a party or bound or to which its property is subject,

all other such violations and defaults, could be considered material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any Laws of any court, Governmental
Entity, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over Parent or such
Significant Subsidiary or any of its properties, as applicable, which, with
respect to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (j)
Certain Regulatory Matters. Each of Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries
(A) is in compliance with any and all Regulatory Laws applicable to it, (B)
holds all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and
other authorizations required of it for the lawful conduct of its business

under, all terms and conditions of any such licenses, certificates, permits,
franchises or authorizations, except where the failure to hold such license,
certificate, permit, franchise or authorization or such noncompliance or

stockholders of the Company, if and only to the extent that, in each such
case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D) above, the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that such action is necessary in order for its directors to
comply with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law and the
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Proposal. A "Superior Proposal" is an
Acquisition Proposal that, if accepted, would be reasonably likely to be
consummated (taking into account the legal, financial and regulatory aspects
of the proposal) and would, if consummated, result in a transaction more
favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The Company agrees that it
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2
and in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7). The Company
agrees that it will notify Parent immediately if any such inquiries,
proposals or offers are received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, any of its representatives indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of
any proposals or offers. The Company also agrees that it will promptly
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of
its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its
Subsidiaries.   6.3. Information Supplied. The Company and Parent each
agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information
expressly supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-4
to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of shares
of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (including the proxy statement and
prospectus (the "Prospectus/Proxy Statement") constituting a part thereof)
(the "S-4 Registration Statement") will, at the time the S-4 Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at
the date of mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of
stockholders of the Company to be held in connection with the Merger, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company and Parent will cause the    -31-  Form S-4 to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that
neither the Company nor Parent makes any covenant other than with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference based on information supplied by
such party specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.   6.4. Stockholders Meeting. The Company will take, in
accordance with applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and by-
laws, all action necessary to call, hold and convene a meeting of holders of
Shares (the "Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective to consider and
vote upon the approval of this Agreement. Except on the determination of the
occurrence of a Superior Proposal and during such time as there remains a
Superior Proposal or as the Company\'s Board of Directors may determine in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company\'s Board
of Directors shall recommend such approval, the Company\'s Board of Directors
shall not amend, modify, withdraw, condition or qualify such recommendation
and shall take all lawful action to solicit such approval. The Company agrees
that it will provide Parent with at least 48 hours prior notice of the
Company\'s Board of Director\'s intention to make any such amendment,
modification, withdrawal, condition or qualification; provided, however, that
such notice shall not be required to the extent that the Company\'s Board of
Directors determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that
such notice violates its fiduciary duties or would cause the Company to
violate any applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the obligation of the Company to convene a Stockholders Meeting
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal, or by any
change of recommendation of the Company\'s Board of Directors. The Company
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal or
propose to do so.   6.5. Filings; Other Actions; Notification. (a) The
Company and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
the S-4 Registration Statement as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof. Parent and the Company each shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and promptly
thereafter mail the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the
Company. Parent shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
prior to the effective date of the S-4 Registration Statement all necessary
state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required in
connection with the Merger and to consummate the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will pay all expenses incident
thereto.   (b) No amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by the Company or Parent without
the prior    -32-  approval of the other party. Each party will advise
the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or comments of the SEC thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company or Parent discovers any information relating to itself, or any of its
affiliates, officers or directors, that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, such party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and the parties
shall jointly prepare an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information which shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by law or regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.   (c) The Company and Parent each shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party
and its directors a letter of its independent auditors, dated (i) the date on
which the S-4 Registration Statement shall become effective and (ii) the
Closing Date, and addressed to the other party and its directors, in form and
substance customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the S-4
Registration Statement.   (d) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with
each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use)
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all documentation to effect all required notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations required to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.5 shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell or hold
separate and agree to sell, before or after the Effective Time, any assets,
businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or agreement
to sell, by the Company of any of its assets or businesses) or to agree to
any material changes or restriction in the operations of any such assets or
businesses. Nothing in this Section shall require Parent or the Company to
take any action which would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of its
Board of Directors as such duties would exist under applicable law in the
absence of this Section. Without    -33-  limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall file any Notification and
Report Forms and related materials that it may be required to file in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice under the HSR Act, shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an early termination of the applicable waiting
period, and shall each make any submissions pursuant thereto that may
be necessary, proper or advisable. Subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall (i) have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the
other on, all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) consult with each other before
meeting with, or engaging in any conference calls with, any antitrust agency
to discuss the transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.   (e) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other and subject to applicable law, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (f) The Company and Parent
each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notice or other communications received
by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries,
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
and Parent each shall give prompt notice to the other of any change that is
reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, respectively.   (g) The Company shall promptly
furnish Parent with copies of any notices and other communications received
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
licenses, certificates, permits or other authorizations from or of
Governmental Entities and any applications relating thereto, unless the
Company reasonably determines that furnishing such copies would violate the
terms of a written confidentiality obligation of the Company to such third
party or applicable law.    -34-   6.6. Taxation. Parent and Company
intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Subject to Section 6.2, each party will (and will
cause its Subsidiaries to) both before and after the Effective Time, (i) use
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify; (ii) refrain from
taking any action that would reasonably be expected to cause the Agreement to
fail to so qualify; and (iii) take the position for all U.S. federal income
tax purposes that the Merger so qualifies.   6.7. Access. Upon reasonable
notice, and except as may otherwise be required by applicable law, the
Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford
the other\'s officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives ("Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties,
books, contracts and records and, during such period, each shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, and provided, further, that the foregoing
shall not require the Company or Parent to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall have used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
such inspection or disclosure. All requests for information made pursuant to
this Section shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, or such Person as may be designated by either of
its officers, as the case may be. All such information shall be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable antitrust and trade
regulation laws. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, access to
"Highly Confidential Information" (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) shall be restricted in accordance with the terms of such
Confidentiality Agreement.   6.8. Affiliates. Prior to the date of the
Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall deliver to the Company a list of names and
addresses of those Persons who are, in the opinion of the Parent, as of the
time of the Stockholders Meeting referred to in Section 6.4, "affiliates" of
the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The
Company shall provide to Parent such information and documents as Parent
shall reasonably request for purposes of preparing such list. The Company
shall exercise its best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to
Parent, prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, from each affiliate of
the Company identified in the foregoing list (as the same may be supplemented
as aforesaid), a letter dated as of the Closing Date substantially in the
form attached as Exhibit A (the "Affiliates Letter"). Parent shall not be
required to maintain the effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement or
any other registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of
resale of Parent Common Stock by such affiliates received in the Merger and
the certificates representing    -35-  Parent Common Stock received by
such affiliates shall bear a customary legend regarding applicable Securities
Act restrictions and the provisions of this Section.   6.9. Nasdaq National
Market Listing and De-listing. Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
quotation on the Nasdaq National Market subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date. The Surviving Corporation shall use its
best efforts to cause the Shares to no longer be quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.   6.10. Publicity. The initial
press release shall be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and
Parent each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases
or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
thereto, except as may be required by law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of the Nasdaq National Market.   6.11.
Benefits.   (a) Stock Options and Warrants.   (i) At the Effective Time,
each outstanding Company Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed
to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Option, the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to (y) the exercise price per Share at which such Company Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (z) the
Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any Company Option to
which Section 422 of the Code applies, the option price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject
to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. At or prior to the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall make all necessary arrangements and take all
necessary actions to cause the assumption of the unexercised Company
Options and Company Warrants by Parent pursuant to this Section. Except with
respect to Company Options that accelerate in vesting pursuant to the
specific terms of their respective option award agreements or under the
applicable Stock Option Plan, the Company shall not take any actions that
would result in the accelerated vesting or cashing out of any Company
Options.    -36-   (ii) Effective at the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume each Company Option in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plan
under which it was issued and the stock option agreement by which it is
evidenced. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Options assumed by
it in accordance with this Section. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than seven days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the
case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), or another
appropriate form with respect to the Parent Common Stock subject to such
Company Options, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Company Options remain outstanding.   (iii) At the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Warrant shall be deemed to constitute a
warrant to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Company Warrant, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest
whole number), at a price per share (rounded down to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (y) the exercise price per Share at which such Company Warrant was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective time divided by (z)
the Exchange Ratio. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Warrants
assumed by it in accordance with this Section.   (iv) The Board of
Directors of the Company and Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, take
all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d)
and Rule 16b-3(e) to exempt (i) the conversion of Shares and Company Options
into Parent Common Stock or options to purchase Parent Common Stock, as the
case may be, and (ii) the acquisition of Parent Common Stock or options to
purchase Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement by officers and directors of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees
of the Company who may become an officer or director of Parent subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.   (b) Benefit
Plans. iv) Subject to any necessary transition periods (during which Parent
will cause the Company to maintain its applicable existing welfare plans),
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (x) provide employees of the
Company who become employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or remain
employees of the Company with employee welfare and pension benefits no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (y) cause each employee welfare
and pension benefit plan, program,    -37-  policy or arrangement of
Parent in which employees of the Company become eligible to participate to
take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder the
service of such employees with the Company to the same extent as such service
was credited for such purpose by the Company. Nothing herein shall limit the
ability of Parent to amend or terminate any of its welfare and pension
benefit plans in accordance with their terms at any time.   (ii) When
employees of the Company become eligible to participate in a medical, dental
or health plan of Parent, to the extent permissible under the applicable
benefit plan, Parent shall cause each such plan to (x) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the
applicable medical, health or dental plans of the Company and (y) waive any
waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would
otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time to
the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous Company plan prior to the Effective Time.   (c) 2001 ESPP
and Company 401-K. The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the
2001 ESPP and the Company\'s 401(k) Plan to terminate prior to the Effective
Time and to (i) cause each Company employee\'s 2001 ESPP account balance to
be distributed in cash to such employee at the time of plan termination and
(ii) cause each Company\'s employee\'s 401(k) Plan account balance to be
distributed to such employee (or rolled over into another qualified plan) at
the time of plan termination. Employees of the Company shall become
eligible to participate in Parent\'s 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as
amended, and 401(k) Savings Plan on the first date new employees are
permitted to join such plans pursuant to the terms of such plans.   6.12.
Expenses. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the transactions
contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the Surviving
Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.5(b), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection
with the filing fee for the S-4 Registration Statement and printing and
mailing the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement
shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.   6.13. Indemnification;
Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent agrees that it shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company, (when acting in such capacity)
determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or    -38-  investigative (collectively,
"Claims"), arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been permitted under Delaware law and any
Claims arising from or related to the transactions contemplated hereby (and
Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, provided the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification);
and provided, further, that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an officer\'s or director\'s conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Delaware law shall be made by independent counsel
mutually selected by the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party.  
(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.13, upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly
notify Parent thereof; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying the Parent shall lessen the
Indemnified Party\'s right to indemnification under this Section unless
Parent is prejudiced thereby. In the event of any such Claim (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, so long as (x) such party notifies in
writing the Indemnified Party (and acknowledges in writing) within 10
business days after the Indemnified Party has given the requisite notice to
Parent that such Indemnified Party will be indemnified from and against any
Costs the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, or
caused by any such Claim without giving effect to the scope of or limitations
on indemnification set forth in Section 6.13(a) (y) such Claim involves only
money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief and
(z) the settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, such Claim
will not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely be
detrimental to the reputation, professional stature or business(es) of the
Indemnified Party; provided, further, that such party may not consent to the
entry of any judgment or settlement with respect to such Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, with such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent, with such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, that Parent shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law. If an Indemnified Party is successful, in whole or in part,
in any proceeding challenging such Indemnified Party\'s right to
indemnification hereunder, Parent shall pay any and all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees) incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with such proceeding.    -39-   (c) Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain the Company\'s existing officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance ("DandO; Insurance") for a period of six years
after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not in
excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof (the
"Current Premium"); provided, however, that if the existing DandO; Insurance
expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six-year period, the
Surviving Corporation will use its best efforts to obtain as much DandO;
Insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a
premium not in excess (on an annualized basis) of the Current Premium.  
(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section.   (e) The provisions of this Section
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.   6.14.
Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. Nothing in
this Section shall require Parent or the Company to take any action which
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors as
such duties would exist under applicable law in the absence of this
Section.   6.15. Retention of Certain Employees. The Company and Parent
shall work together in good faith using reasonable efforts to retain selected
key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including new employment
terms as appropriate.   6.16. Conduct of Merger Sub. Parent will take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.   6.17. Rule 144 Reporting. From and after the Effective
Time, unless and until the earlier of the time that (i) each affiliate of the
Company has disposed of all Parent Common Stock received as merger
consideration in the Merger and (ii) such shares are permitted to be resold
pursuant to Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act, Parent shall make and
keep "available adequate current public information" (as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) with respect to
Parent.    -40-   ARTICLE VII   Conditions   7.1. Conditions to Each
Party\'s Obligation to Effect the Merger. The respective obligation of each
party to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or
prior to the Effective Time of each of the following conditions:   (a)
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement shall have been duly approved by holders
of Shares constituting the Company Requisite Vote in accordance with
applicable law and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Company.   (b) H-S-R. The waiting period applicable to the consummation of
the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated.   (c)
Litigation. No court or Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect
and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, an
"Order"), and no Governmental Entity shall have instituted any proceeding
seeking any such Order.   (d) S-4. The S-4 Registration Statement shall
have become effective under the Securities Act. No stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement shall have been issued, and
no proceedings for that purpose shall have been initiated or be threatened,
by the SEC.   (e) Blue Sky Approvals. Parent shall have received all
state securities and "blue sky" permits and approvals necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.   7.2. Conditions to Obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the
Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior
to the Effective Time of the following conditions:   (a) Representations
and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement
(without regard to any materiality qualification contained in such
representation or warranty) and as of the Closing Date (without regard to any
materiality qualification contained in such representation or warranty) as
though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any such
representation or warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date); provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section
7.2(a) shall be deemed to have been satisfied even if such representations or
warranties are not so true and correct unless the failure of such   
-41-  representations or warranties to be so true and correct, individually
or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received a certificate signed on

speaks as of an earlier date); provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, this Section 7.3(a) shall be deemed to have
been satisfied even if such representations or warranties are not so true and
correct unless the failure of such representations or warranties to be so
true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably
likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the President of Parent
and the President of Merger Sub to such effect.   (b) Performance of
Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company, Parent

provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this
Section 7.3(d) shall be deemed to have been satisfied unless the failure to

aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.    -43-   (e) Tax Opinion. The Company shall have
received the opinion of Kirkland and Ellis, counsel to the Company, dated the
Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger will be treated for Federal
income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, and that each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be a
party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the

any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the approval by
stockholders of the Company referred to in Section 7.1(a), by mutual written
consent of the Company and Parent by action of their respective Boards of
Directors.   8.2. Termination by Either Parent or the Company. This
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Effective Time by action of the Board of Directors of either Parent or
the Company if (i) the Merger shall not have been consummated by December 31,
2002, whether such date is before or after the date of approval by the
stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that if either party
determines that additional time is necessary in order to forestall any action
to restrain, enjoin or prohibit the Merger by any federal, state, local or
foreign court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of
any applicable antitrust laws, the Termination Date may be extended by such
party to a date not beyond March 31, 2003 (the "Termination Date"); provided,
further, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause
(i) shall not be available to any party that has breached in any material
respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have
proximately caused the occurrence of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated; (ii) the approval of the Company\'s stockholders required by
Section 7.1(a) shall not have been obtained at a meeting duly convened
therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; or (iii) any Order
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of
the Merger shall become final and    -44-  non-appealable (whether before
or after the approval by the stockholders of the Company). If a party (the
"Extending Party") elects to extend the Termination Date pursuant to the
first proviso of this Section 8.2, then the other party (the "Non-Extending
Party") may deliver the Extending Party a written update of its Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, within
three Business Days of such election to reflect new facts occurring after the
date hereof together with a written request that the Extending Party
confirm that such new facts shall not be deemed to render any of the Non-
Extending Party\'s representations and warranties untrue or incorrect as of
such date or deemed to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, as of such date. If the
Extending Party does not provide such confirmation prior to the fifth
Business Day after receiving such written update, then the Termination Date
shall not be extended.   8.3. Termination by the Company. This Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the approval by stockholders of the
Company referred to in Section 7.1(a), by action of the Board of Directors of
the Company if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any
such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, such that Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), as applicable, would not
be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is
not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof is given by the Company
to Parent.   8.4. Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by
action of the Board of Directors of Parent if (i) the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have withdrawn or adversely modified its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or (ii) there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue
after the date of this Agreement, such that Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b), as
applicable, would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not
curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice
thereof is given by Parent to the Company.   8.5. Effect of Termination and
Abandonment. (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement
(other than as set forth in Section 9.1) shall become void and of no effect
with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); provided, however, except as otherwise provided herein, no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement.   (b) If this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(i) in the case of a
withdrawal or adverse notification of the Company\'s Board of
Directors\'    -45-  approval or recommendation of this Agreement in the
absence of an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall promptly, but in
no event later than two days after the date of such termination, pay Parent a
termination fee of $5,000,000 and shall promptly, but in no event later than
two days after being notified of such by Parent, pay all of the charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, incurred by Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in each case payable by wire transfer of same day funds.  
(c) In the event that an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders or any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to
make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent
or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(i) or Section 8.2(ii) or this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(i) (other than
under the circumstances contemplated in Section 8.5(b)) or Section 8.4(ii)
and thereafter the Company enters into any agreement to consummate a
transaction or series of transactions which, had such agreement been proposed
or negotiated during the term of this Agreement, would have constituted an
Acquisition Proposal (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement"), which is
publicly announced within twelve (12) months after the termination of this
Agreement and is consummated within eighteen (18) months after the
termination of this Agreement (whether or not any Company Acquisition
Agreement related to an Acquisition Proposal which had been made or announced
at the time of the termination of this Agreement), then the Company shall,
contemporaneously with such consummation, pay Parent a termination fee of
$45,000,000 and shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after
being notified of such by Parent, pay all of the charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in each case payable by wire transfer of same day funds.  
(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections 8.5(b)
and (c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Sections 8.5(b) or (c), and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in Section 8.5(b) or
(c), the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.    -46-
