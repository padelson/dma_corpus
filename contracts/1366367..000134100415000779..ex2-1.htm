AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 12, 2015 (this "Agreement"),
among Yadkin Financial Corporation, a North Carolina corporation ("Yadkin"),
Navy Merger Sub Corp., a North Carolina corporation and a wholly-own
Subsidiary of Yadkin ("Merger Sub") and NewBridge Bancorp, a North Carolina
corporation ("NewBridge").

  

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Yadkin and NewBridge have determined that
it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into NewBridge (the
"Merger"), so that NewBridge is the surviving corporation in the Merger and a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Yadkin and (ii) immediately thereafter, NewBridge
will merge (the "Second-Step Merger", and together with the Merger, the
"Integrated Mergers") with and into Yadkin, with Yadkin being the surviving
corporation in the Integrated Mergers (hereinafter sometimes referred to in
such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation");

  

  

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single integrated
transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this
Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and within the meaning of
Treasury regulation section 1.368-2(g);

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and an inducement for each party to enter into this Agreement,
certain shareholders of each of NewBridge and Yadkin have simultaneously
herewith entered into a voting agreement (collectively, the "Voting
Agreements") in connection with the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with applicable law including the bank and bank holding company
laws of North Carolina (N.C.G.S. § 53C-7-201 et seq. and N.C.G.S. §53C-10-201
et seq.) and the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the "NCBCA"), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into NewBridge. NewBridge
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
North Carolina. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

  

  

1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger ( the "Articles of Merger") to be filed with the North
Carolina Secretary of State (the "NC Secretary") on the Closing Date. The term
"Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective,
as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

  

  

1.3 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the NCBCA and the
bank and bank holding company laws of North Carolina. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of NewBridge and
Merger Sub shall vest in the surviving corporation in the Merger, and all
claims, obligations, debts, liabilities and duties of NewBridge and Merger Sub
shall become the claims, obligations, debts, liabilities and duties of the
surviving corporation in the Merger.

  

  

1.4 Conversion of NewBridge Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Yadkin, Merger Sub or
NewBridge or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each Class A share of NewBridge's common stock,
no par value, and each Class B share of NewBridge's non-voting common stock,
no par value, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such Class A and Class B shares, collectively, the "NewBridge Common Stock"),
except for shares of NewBridge Common Stock owned by NewBridge or Yadkin (in
each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.50
shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the voting common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of Yadkin (the "Yadkin Common Stock").

  

  

(b) All of the shares of NewBridge Common Stock converted into the right to
receive Yadkin Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a "Certificate", it being
understood that any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed to
include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of shares of NewBridge Common Stock) previously representing any such shares
of NewBridge Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
(i) a certificate (or evidence of book-entry as determined by Yadkin in its
sole discretion) representing the number of whole shares of Yadkin Common
Stock which such shares of NewBridge Common Stock have been converted into the
right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
NewBridge Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted
into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e),
without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions which
the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2.
Certificates previously representing shares of NewBridge Common Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Yadkin Common Stock
(together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in
lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender
of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest
thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Yadkin

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Common Stock or NewBridge Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend
or distribution, in each case, except as otherwise permitted by this
Agreement, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of NewBridge Common Stock that are owned by
NewBridge or Yadkin (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity
or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of Yadkin or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

1.5 Merger Sub and Yadkin Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, (i)
each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the surviving
corporation in the Merger and (ii) each share of Yadkin Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued
and outstanding share of Yadkin and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  

  

1.6 Treatment of NewBridge Equity Awards.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by NewBridge to purchase shares
of NewBridge Common Stock under a NewBridge Equity Plan (as defined below),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a "NewBridge Stock Option") shall, without any
further action on the part of any holder thereof, be assumed and converted
into an option to purchase from Yadkin, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such NewBridge Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the number of shares of Yadkin Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of
NewBridge Common Stock subject to such NewBridge Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, at a per share exercise
price, (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (i) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of NewBridge
Common Stock subject to such NewBridge Stock Options by (ii) the aggregate
number of shares of Yadkin Common Stock to be subject to such NewBridge Stock
Options after giving effect to the adjustments in this Section 1.6(a) (each,
as so adjusted, a "Converted NewBridge Option"). All rounding described in
this Section 1.6(a) shall be done on an aggregate basis.

  

  

(b) The Converted NewBridge Options shall have the same vesting schedule
(including any acceleration of vesting as provided in the NewBridge Equity
Plans) as the NewBridge Stock Options and otherwise shall have the same terms
and conditions as such NewBridge Stock Options; provided, that Yadkin shall
convert NewBridge Stock Options into Converted NewBridge Options in a manner
that would not cause the Converted NewBridge Options to be treated as the
grant of a new stock right for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. After
such assumption and conversion, the Converted NewBridge Options shall be
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the plan and grant agreements
under which the NewBridge Stock

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Options were originally issued (including any applicable change in control or
other accelerated vesting provisions, and this transaction shall constitute a
change in control for all relevant provisions).

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award and/or restricted stock
unit award in respect of shares of NewBridge Common Stock granted under a
NewBridge Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a "NewBridge Restricted Stock Unit Award" and, together with the
NewBridge Stock Options, the "NewBridge Equity Awards") shall be converted
into that number of restricted stock units of Yadkin Common Stock ("Converted
NewBridge RSUs") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of NewBridge
Common Stock subject to such NewBridge Restricted Stock Unit Award and (y) the
Exchange Ratio. Any Converted NewBridge RSUs issued pursuant to this Section
1.6(c) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such NewBridge Restricted Stock Unit Award (including any applicable
change in control or other accelerated vesting provisions, and this
transaction shall constitute a change in control for all relevant provisions).

  

  

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, NewBridge, the Board of Directors of
NewBridge and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary, including obtaining any
consents, to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6, and to ensure that
following the Effective Time, there are no obligations with respect to
NewBridge Equity Awards other than as set forth in this Section 1.6; provided,
that no action taken by NewBridge shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

  

  

(i) "NewBridge Equity Plans" means (1) the LSB Bancshares, Inc. 1996 Omnibus
Stock Incentive Plan, as amended; (2) the FNB Financial Services Corporation
Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, as amended; (3) the NewBridge Amended and
Restated Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan; (4) the NewBridge Amended and
Restated Comprehensive Equity Compensation Plan for Directors and Employees;
(5) the CapStone Bank 2006 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan; (6) the CapStone
Bank 2006 Incentive Stock Option Plan; (7) the Patriot State Bank 2007
Incentive Stock Option Plan; (8) the Patriot State Bank 2007 Nonstatutory
Stock Option Plan; (9) the Premier Commercial Bank Employee Stock Option Plan;
(10) the Premier Commercial Bank Director Stock Option Plan; and (11) the
NewBridge 2015 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as well as any other plans or
agreements pursuant to which NewBridge or its Subsidiaries has granted equity
awards (including equity awards granted or assumed by NewBridge in connection
with any acquisitions prior to the Effective Time).

  

  

1.7 Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation in the Merger. At the
Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect at
the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the surviving
corporation in the Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

1.8 Bylaws of Surviving Corporation in the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Bylaws of the surviving corporation in the Merger until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

  

  

1.9 Directors; Officers. At and immediately after the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of the surviving corporation in the Merger shall
consist of the directors and officers of Merger Sub in office immediately
prior to the Effective Time until their respective successor are duly elected
or appointed and qualified.

  

  

1.10 Tax Consequences. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (i) the parties
intend that (x) the Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single
integrated transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and (y) Yadkin, Merger Sub and NewBridge shall
each be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of
the Code, and (ii) this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as,
a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the
Code and within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

  

  

1.11 Bank Merger. Immediately following the Integrated Mergers, NewBridge Bank
("NewBridge Bank"), a North Carolina chartered bank and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of NewBridge, will merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into Yadkin
Bank, a North Carolina chartered bank and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Yadkin.
Yadkin Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following
the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of NewBridge Bank shall
cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective
immediately after the Effective Time. On the date of this Agreement, Yadkin
Bank and NewBridge Bank entered into the agreement and plan of merger attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Bank Merger Agreement"). NewBridge shall cause
NewBridge Bank, and Yadkin shall cause Yadkin Bank, to consummate the Bank
Merger by filing such documents and certificates as are necessary to make the
Bank Merger effective ("Bank Merger Certificates") immediately following the
effective time of the Integrated Mergers.

  

  

ARTICLE II 
 

  

  

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  

  

2.1 Yadkin to Make Shares Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, Yadkin
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
designated by Yadkin and reasonably acceptable to NewBridge (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at Yadkin's option, evidence
of shares in book-entry form (collectively, referred to herein as
"certificates"), representing the shares of Yadkin Common Stock, and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Yadkin
Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of NewBridge Common Stock.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

2.2 Exchange of Shares.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Yadkin shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of
NewBridge Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Yadkin Common Stock
pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of Yadkin
Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
NewBridge Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as
well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b),
if any. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange
and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Yadkin Common
Stock to which such holder of NewBridge Common Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing
the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (B) any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates. Subject to
applicable law, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of
Yadkin Common Stock which the shares of NewBridge Common Stock represented by
such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as
contemplated by this Section 2.2.

  

  

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Yadkin Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Yadkin
Common Stock which the shares of NewBridge Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

  

  

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Yadkin Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Yadkin

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of NewBridge of the shares of NewBridge Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Yadkin Common Stock as provided in this
Article II.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Yadkin Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Yadkin Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Yadkin. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, after aggregating all
shares converted with respect to such former shareholder of NewBridge, Yadkin
shall pay to each former shareholder of NewBridge who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale
prices of Yadkin Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"NYSE") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the ten (10) full trading
days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a
share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Yadkin Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.4.

  

  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of NewBridge for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of
NewBridge who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of
Yadkin Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Yadkin Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each former share of NewBridge Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Yadkin, NewBridge, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of NewBridge Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

  

  

(g) Yadkin shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Yadkin Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this
Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
(including any NewBridge Equity Awards) to any person such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld (which may be withheld through withholding
of shares of Yadkin Common Stock) by Yadkin or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Yadkin or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

  

  

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Yadkin, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Yadkin may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Yadkin Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE III 
 

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NEWBRIDGE

  

  

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by NewBridge to
Yadkin concurrently herewith (the "NewBridge Disclosure Schedule"); provided,
that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the NewBridge Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by NewBridge that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article III to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies
to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any NewBridge Reports filed by
NewBridge since December 31, 2014, and prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), NewBridge hereby
represents and warrants to Yadkin as follows:

  

  

3.1 Corporate Organization.

  

  

(a) NewBridge is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of North Carolina, is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
("BHC Act"). NewBridge has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. NewBridge is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge. As used
in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to
Yadkin, NewBridge or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results
of operations or financial

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided,
however, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall
not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or applicable
regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in
laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after
the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market
conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, (D) public
disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly
required by this Agreement or actions or omissions that are taken with the
prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to
the extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately
adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party
and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement,
the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any person, means any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person of which (i)
such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls at least a majority
of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting
power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing
similar functions or (ii) such first person is or directly or indirectly has
the power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing member or others
performing similar functions.

  

  

True and complete copies of the Amended Articles of Incorporation of NewBridge
(the "NewBridge Certificate") and the Amended and Restated By-Laws (the
"NewBridge Bylaws"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by NewBridge to Yadkin.

  

  

(b) Each Subsidiary of NewBridge (a "NewBridge Subsidiary") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge and (iii) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of NewBridge to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case
of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of NewBridge that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by
law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such
insurance are pending or threatened. Section 3.1 (b) of the NewBridge
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of
NewBridge as of the date hereof.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

3.2 Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of NewBridge consists of 100,000,000 shares
of NewBridge Common Stock (of which number 90,000,000 are Class A shares of

examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of NewBridge and its Subsidiaries, (i) no Regulatory Agency has
initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of NewBridge,
investigation into the business or operations of NewBridge or any of its

whole, (ii) there is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any

Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge.

  

  

3.6 Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The financial statements of NewBridge and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the NewBridge Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of NewBridge and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of
NewBridge and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of NewBridge and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Neither Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP nor Grant Thornton LLP has
resigned (or informed NewBridge that it intends to resign) or been dismissed
as independent public accountants of NewBridge as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with NewBridge on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge, neither NewBridge
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of NewBridge included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2015, or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of NewBridge and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of NewBridge or its Subsidiaries or their accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on NewBridge. NewBridge (x) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(the "Exchange Act")) to ensure that material information relating to
NewBridge, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of NewBridge by others within those
entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act"), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to NewBridge's outside auditors and the audit committee of
NewBridge's Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect NewBridge's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in NewBridge's internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to NewBridge's auditors and
audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Yadkin. There
is no reason to believe that NewBridge's outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

  

  

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither NewBridge nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of NewBridge, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing NewBridge
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by NewBridge or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by NewBridge or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of
NewBridge or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of NewBridge, to any
director or officer of NewBridge.

  

  

3.7 Broker's Fees. With the exception of the engagement of Sandler O'Neill +
Partners, L.P., neither NewBridge nor any NewBridge Subsidiary nor any of
their respective officers or directors has engaged any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees, commissions
or finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. NewBridge has disclosed to Yadkin as of the
date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement
by NewBridge of Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., related to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereunder.

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon NewBridge, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of NewBridge or

all of which together with NewBridge would be deemed a "single employer"
within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a "NewBridge ERISA Affiliate"),
is a party or has any current or future obligation or that are sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by NewBridge or
any of its Subsidiaries or any NewBridge ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

respect to each NewBridge Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter
has not been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened), and, to the

relating thereto. No trust funding any NewBridge Benefit Plan is intended to
meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

present value of accrued benefits under such NewBridge Benefit Plan, based
upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent

date, exceed the then current fair market value of the assets of such
NewBridge Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (iii) no reportable
event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day

NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries, and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any such NewBridge Benefit Plan.

  

  

(g) None of NewBridge, its Subsidiaries nor any NewBridge ERISA Affiliate has,
at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), and
none of NewBridge and its Subsidiaries nor any NewBridge ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a
result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part
1 of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan.

  

  

(h) Neither NewBridge nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or
has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for
any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

  

  

(i) All contributions required to be made to any NewBridge Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
NewBridge Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been
timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid
on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and
records of NewBridge.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(j) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to NewBridge's knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that
may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the
NewBridge Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties
to the NewBridge Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of
the NewBridge Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the
IRS, the DOL, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in a NewBridge Benefit Plan, or any other party.

  

  

(k) None of NewBridge and its Subsidiaries nor any NewBridge ERISA Affiliate
nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the NewBridge Benefit Plans or their related
trusts, NewBridge, any of its Subsidiaries, any NewBridge ERISA Affiliate or
any person that NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

  

  

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, compensation
(including stock or stock-based), right or other benefit to any employee,
officer, director, independent contractor, consultant or other service
provider of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation
on the right of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any NewBridge Benefit Plan or
related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by
NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither NewBridge nor
any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar
funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
cause or require NewBridge or any of its affiliates to establish or make any
contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle.

  

  

(m) No NewBridge Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. NewBridge has made
available to Yadkin true, correct and complete copies of Section 280G
calculations (whether or not final) with respect to any disqualified
individual in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(n) Neither NewBridge nor its Subsidiaries remain subject to any compensation-
related limitations or restrictions imposed by or related to Section 111 of
the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended.

labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against
NewBridge

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes
against NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither NewBridge nor any of its
Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar
agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to
with any labor organization or employee association applicable to employees of
NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of NewBridge, there
are no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any
employees of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries and no employees of
NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries are represented by any labor
organization.

  

  

(p) To the knowledge of NewBridge, no current or former employee or
independent contractor of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation
in any material respect of any term of any restrictive covenant obligation,
including any non-compete, non-solicit, non-interference, non-disparagement or
confidentiality obligation, ("Restrictive Covenant") or any employment or
consulting contract, common law nondisclosure obligation, fiduciary duty, or
other obligation: (i) to NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) to a
former employer or engager of any such individual relating (A) to the right of
any such individual to work for NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) to
the knowledge or use of trade secrets or proprietary information.

  

  

(q) To the knowledge of NewBridge, no employee of NewBridge or any of its
Subsidiaries with annual compensation in excess of $200,000 intends to
terminate his or her employment relationship.

  

  

3.12 SEC Reports. NewBridge has previously made available to Yadkin an
accurate and complete copy of each communication mailed by NewBridge to its
shareholders since December 31, 2012 and prior to the date hereof. No such
communication or any final registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC
since December 31, 2012 by NewBridge pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act (the "NewBridge
Reports"), as of the date thereof (and, in the case of registration statements
and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the
relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since December
31, 2012, as of their respective dates, all NewBridge Reports filed under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of NewBridge has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect
to any of the NewBridge Reports.

  

  

3.13 Compliance with Applicable Law. NewBridge and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2012, held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

   
 

paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except
where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and
holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to
pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge, and to
the knowledge of NewBridge no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. NewBridge and each
of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any applicable law, statute, order, rule,

(i) used any funds of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries for unlawful

3.14 Certain Contracts.

  

  

(a) As of the date hereof, neither NewBridge nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding
(whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of any directors,
officers, employees, independent contractors or consultants other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon
the execution or delivery of this Agreement,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

   
 

shareholder adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional acts or events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise) becoming due from Yadkin, NewBridge, the Surviving Corporation,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof,
(iii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iv) which contains a non-compete or
client or customer non-solicit requirement or any other provision that
materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by NewBridge or any
of its affiliates or upon consummation of the Merger will materially restrict
the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates to engage in
any line of business, (v) with or to a labor union or guild (including any
collective bargaining agreement), (vi) any of the benefits of which contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding (including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan)
will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be
accelerated, by the occurrence of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, shareholder adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (vii) that relates to the incurrence of
indebtedness by NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries (other than deposit
liabilities, trade payables, federal funds purchased, advances and loans from
the Federal Home Loan Bank and securities sold under agreements to repurchase,
in each case incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice) in the principal amount of $500,000 or more including any sale and
leaseback transactions, capitalized leases and other similar financing
transactions, (viii) that grants any right of first refusal, right of first
offer or similar right with respect to any material assets, rights or
properties of NewBridge or its Subsidiaries or (ix) that is a consulting
agreement or data processing, software programming or licensing contract
involving the payment of more than $100,000 per annum (other than any such
contracts which are terminable by NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries on
sixty (60) days or less notice without any required payment or other
conditions, other than the condition of notice). Each contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 3.14(a),
whether or not set forth in the NewBridge Disclosure Schedule, is referred to
herein as a "NewBridge Contract," and neither NewBridge nor any of its
Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any violation of the above
by any of the other parties thereto which would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
NewBridge.

  

  

(b) Each NewBridge Contract is valid and binding on NewBridge or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge. NewBridge and each of its Subsidiaries
has in all material respects performed all obligations required to be
performed by it to date under each NewBridge Contract, except where such
noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge. To NewBridge's
knowledge each third-party counterparty to each NewBridge Contract has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to
date under such NewBridge Contract, except where such noncompliance, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge, and no event or condition exists which
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
material default on the part of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such NewBridge Contract, except where such default, either

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

   
 

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge.

  

  

3.15 Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Neither NewBridge nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2013, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2013,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether or not set forth in the NewBridge Disclosure Schedule,
a "NewBridge Regulatory Agreement"), nor has NewBridge or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2013, by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such NewBridge Regulatory Agreement. NewBridge and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with each
Regulatory Agreement to which it is a party or subject. NewBridge and its
Subsidiaries have not received any notice from any Governmental Entity
indicating that NewBridge or its Subsidiaries is not in compliance in any
material respect with any Regulatory Agreement.

  

  

3.16 Risk Management Instruments. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar derivative
transactions and risk management arrangements (each, a "Derivative Contract"),
whether entered into for the account of NewBridge, any of its Subsidiaries or
for the account of a customer of NewBridge or one of its Subsidiaries, were
entered into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with
applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Agency and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are
legal, valid and binding obligations of NewBridge or one of its Subsidiaries
enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies
(the "Enforceability Exceptions")), and are in full force and effect.
NewBridge and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material
respects all of their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued, and, to NewBridge's knowledge, there are
no material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of
such by any party thereunder. Each such Derivative Contract has been reflected
in the books and records of NewBridge and such Subsidiaries in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied. Each Derivative Contract is evidenced by customary
and appropriate documentation (including an ISDA master agreement and long-
form confirmation).

  

  

3.17 Environmental Matters. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
NewBridge, NewBridge and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have
complied, with any federal, state or local law, regulation, order, decree,
permit, authorization, common law or agency requirement relating to: (i) the
protection or restoration of the environment, health and safety as it relates
to hazardous substance exposure or natural resource damages, (ii) the
handling, use, presence, disposal,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

   
 

release or threatened release of, or exposure to, any hazardous substance, or
(iii) noise, odor, wetlands, indoor air, pollution, contamination or any
injury to persons or property from exposure to any hazardous substance
(collectively, "Environmental Laws"). There are no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims or actions, or to the knowledge of
NewBridge any private environmental investigations or remediation activities
or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on NewBridge or any of its
Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental
Law, pending or threatened against NewBridge, which liability or obligation
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge. To the knowledge of NewBridge, there
is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge. NewBridge is not subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of
agreement by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing
that would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NewBridge.

  

  

3.18 Investment Securities and Commodities.

  

  

(a) Each of NewBridge and its Subsidiaries has good title to all securities
and commodities owned by it (except those sold under repurchase agreements),
free and clear of any Lien, except to the extent such securities or
commodities are pledged in the ordinary course of business to secure
obligations of NewBridge or its Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities
are valued on the books of NewBridge in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects.

  

  

(b) NewBridge and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses employ
investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,
practices and procedures that NewBridge believes are prudent and reasonable in
the context of such businesses. Prior to the date of this Agreement, NewBridge
has made available to Yadkin the material terms of such policies, practices
and procedures.

  

  

3.19 Real Property. NewBridge or a NewBridge Subsidiary has good and
marketable title to all the real property reflected in the latest audited
balance sheet included in the NewBridge Reports as being owned by NewBridge or
a NewBridge Subsidiary or acquired after the date thereof (except properties
sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of
business) (the "NewBridge Owned Properties"), free and clear of all material
Liens, except statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, Liens for real
property Taxes not yet due and payable, easements, rights of way, and other
similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the value or use of the
properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise
materially impair business operations at such properties and such
imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as do not materially affect
the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected
thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such properties
(collectively, "Permitted Encumbrances"), and is the lessee of all leasehold
estates reflected in the latest audited financial statements included in such
NewBridge Reports or acquired after the date thereof (except for leases that
have expired by their terms since the date

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

   
 

thereof) (the "NewBridge Leased Properties" and, collectively with the
NewBridge Owned Properties, the "NewBridge Real Property"), free and clear of
all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is
in possession of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each
such lease is valid without default thereunder by the lessee or, to
NewBridge's knowledge, the lessor. There are no pending or, to the knowledge
of NewBridge, threatened condemnation proceedings against the NewBridge Real
Property.

  

  

3.20 Intellectual Property. NewBridge and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any material Liens), all
Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on NewBridge: (i) (A) the use of any Intellectual Property by
NewBridge and its Subsidiaries does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise
violate the rights of any person and is in accordance with any applicable
license pursuant to which NewBridge or any NewBridge Subsidiary acquired the
right to use any Intellectual Property, and (B) no person has asserted to
NewBridge that NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property rights of such
person, (ii) no person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating
any right of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to NewBridge or its
Subsidiaries, and (iii) neither NewBridge nor any NewBridge Subsidiary has
received any notice of any pending claim with respect to any Intellectual
Property owned by NewBridge or any NewBridge Subsidiary, and NewBridge and its
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable actions to avoid the
abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of all Intellectual Property
owned or licensed, respectively, by NewBridge and its Subsidiaries. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" means trademarks, service
marks, brand names, internet domain names, logos, symbols, certification
marks, trade dress and other indications of origin, the goodwill associated
with the foregoing and registrations in any jurisdiction of, and applications
in any jurisdiction to register, the foregoing, including any extension,
modification or renewal of any such registration or application; inventions,
discoveries and ideas, whether patentable or not, in any jurisdiction;
patents, applications for patents (including divisions, continuations,
continuations in part and renewal applications), all improvements thereto, and
any renewals, extensions or reissues thereof, in any jurisdiction; nonpublic
information, trade secrets and know-how, including processes, technologies,
protocols, formulae, prototypes and confidential information and rights in any
jurisdiction to limit the use or disclosure thereof by any person; writings
and other works, whether copyrightable or not and whether in published or
unpublished works, in any jurisdiction; and registrations or applications for
registration of copyrights in any jurisdiction, and any renewals or extensions
thereof; and any similar intellectual property or proprietary rights.

  

  

3.21 Related Party Transactions. There are no transactions or series of
related transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are
there any currently proposed transactions or series of related transactions,
between NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current
or former director or "executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who
beneficially owns (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) 5%
or more of the outstanding NewBridge Common Stock (or any of such person's
immediate family members or affiliates) (other than Subsidiaries of NewBridge)
on the other hand, except those of a type available to employees of NewBridge
or its Subsidiaries generally.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

3.22 State Takeover Laws. No "moratorium," "fair price," "business
combination," "control share acquisition," "interested stockholder", or
similar provision of any state anti-takeover (any such laws, "Takeover
Statutes") is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the NCBCA or federal law.

  

  

3.23 Reorganization. NewBridge has not taken any action, and is not aware of
any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
Integrated Mergers, taken together, from being treated as an integrated
transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

  

  

3.24 Opinion. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the board of directors
of NewBridge has received an opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally,
has been or will be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) of
Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions, and
limitations set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio in the Merger is fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of NewBridge Common Stock. Such opinion
has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

  

  

3.25 NewBridge Information. The information relating to NewBridge and its
Subsidiaries which is provided by NewBridge or its representatives for
inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement and the S-4, or in any other document
filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement (except for
such portions thereof that relate only to Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries)

Enforceability Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or

Loan.

Subsidiaries to any "executive officer" or other "insider" (as each such term
is defined in Regulation O promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board) of
NewBridge or its Subsidiaries, other than Loans that are subject to and that
were made and continue to be in compliance with Regulation O or that are
exempt therefrom.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF YADKIN

  

  

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Yadkin to
NewBridge concurrently herewith (the "Yadkin Disclosure Schedule"); provided,
that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Yadkin Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Yadkin that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article IV shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article IV specifically referenced
or cross-

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

   
 

referenced and (2) other sections of Article IV to the extent it is reasonably
apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to
such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any Yadkin Reports filed by Yadkin
since December 31, 2014, and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk
factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures
of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), Yadkin hereby represents and warrants to NewBridge
as follows:

  

  

4.1 Corporate Organization.

  

  

(a) Yadkin is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of North Carolina and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the BHC Act. Yadkin has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Yadkin.

  

  

True and complete copies of the Amended Articles of Incorporation of Yadkin
(the "Yadkin Certificate") and the Amended Bylaws of Yadkin (the "Yadkin
Bylaws"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been
made available by Yadkin to NewBridge.

  

  

(b) Each Subsidiary of Yadkin (a "Yadkin Subsidiary") (i) is duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii)
is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so
qualified would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Yadkin, and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Yadkin to pay
dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Subsidiary of Yadkin that is an insured depository institution are insured by
the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by
law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such
insurance are pending or threatened. Section 4.1(b) of the Yadkin Disclosure

of the date hereof.

granted by Yadkin under the inducement grant exception, as well as any other

of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of Yadkin Common
Stock at the Yadkin Meeting to approve the issuance of shares of Yadkin Common
Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Requisite Yadkin Vote"), no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Yadkin are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Yadkin and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by NewBridge) constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of Yadkin, enforceable against Yadkin in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). The shares of Yadkin Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger have been validly authorized (subject to the
attainment of the Requisite Yadkin Vote), when issued, will be validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, and no current or past shareholder of Yadkin
will have any preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

  

  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Yadkin, nor the
consummation by Yadkin of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance
by Yadkin with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any
provision of the Yadkin Certificate or the Yadkin Bylaws, or (ii) assuming
that the consents and approvals referred to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained,
(x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
writ, decree or injunction applicable to Yadkin, any of its Subsidiaries or

constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a
right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed
of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause
(y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which either
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Yadkin.

report, registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws,
rules or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or
any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either

Material Adverse Effect on Yadkin. Except for normal examinations conducted by
a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Yadkin and its
Subsidiaries, (i) no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any
proceeding or, to the knowledge of Yadkin, investigation into the business or

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) there is no unresolved violation,
criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Yadkin or any of its

business, operations, policies or procedures of Yadkin or any of its

expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Yadkin.

  

  

4.6 Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The financial statements of Yadkin and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Yadkin Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of Yadkin and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of Yadkin and its

therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end
audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in

in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of Yadkin and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Dixon

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Hughes Goodman LLP has not resigned (or informed Yadkin that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Yadkin as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with Yadkin on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

  

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Yadkin, neither Yadkin nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Yadkin included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015 (including any notes thereto)
and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since June 30, 2015, or in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Yadkin and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Yadkin or its Subsidiaries or their accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Yadkin. Yadkin (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Yadkin, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Yadkin by others within those entities as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to Yadkin's outside auditors and the audit committee
of Yadkin's Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Yadkin's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Yadkin's internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to Yadkin's auditors and audit committee
and a copy has previously been made available to NewBridge. There is no reason
to believe that Yadkin's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

  

  

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither Yadkin nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Yadkin, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Yadkin or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Yadkin or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 

accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Yadkin or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Yadkin or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Yadkin or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Yadkin
or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Yadkin, to any director or
officer of Yadkin.

  

  

4.7 Broker's Fees. With the exception of the engagement of Keefe Bruyette and
Woods, Inc., neither Yadkin nor any Yadkin Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has engaged any broker, finder or financial
advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or
finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

4.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

  

  

(a) Since December 31, 2014, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Yadkin.

  

  

(b) Since December 31, 2014, Yadkin and its Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.

  

  

4.9 Legal Proceedings.

administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against Yadkin or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers

this Agreement.

  

  

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon Yadkin, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Yadkin or any of

material to Yadkin and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

  

4.10 Taxes and Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) Each of Yadkin and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed or caused to

Subsidiaries which have not been paid or settled.

  

  

(f) Neither Yadkin nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any
item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for
any taxable year (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a

4.14 Certain Contracts.

  

  

(a) Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written
or oral) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to which Yadkin nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
as of the date hereof has been filed as an exhibit to the most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed by Yadkin, or a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or
Current Report on Form 8-K subsequent thereto (each, a "Yadkin Contract"), and
neither Yadkin nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice
of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Yadkin.

  

  

(b) Each Yadkin Contract is valid and binding on Yadkin or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Yadkin. Yadkin and each of its Subsidiaries has in
all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it
to date under each Yadkin Contract, except where such noncompliance, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Yadkin. To Yadkin's knowledge each third-party
counterparty to each Yadkin Contract has in all material respects performed
all obligations required to be performed by it to date under such Yadkin
Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Yadkin, and no event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice
or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of
Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Yadkin Contract, except where
such default, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Yadkin.

  

  

4.15 Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Neither Yadkin nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or

similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2013, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2013,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether or not set forth in the Yadkin Disclosure Schedule, a
"Yadkin Regulatory Agreement"), nor has Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised since January 1, 2013, by any Regulatory Agency

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering or requesting any such Yadkin Regulatory Agreement. Yadkin and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with each Regulatory

Regulatory Agreement.

  

  

4.16 Risk Management Instruments. All Derivative Contracts, whether entered

a customer of Yadkin or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the
ordinary course of business and in accordance with applicable rules,
regulations and policies of any Regulatory Agency and with counterparties
believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and
binding obligations of Yadkin or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in
accordance with their terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions, and are in full force and effect.
Yadkin and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material
respects all of their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued, and, to Yadkin's knowledge, there are no
material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such
by any party thereunder. Each such Derivative Contract has been reflected in
the books and records of Yadkin and such Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied. Each Derivative Contract is evidenced by customary and
appropriate documentation (including an ISDA master agreement and long-form
confirmation).

  

  

4.17 Related Party Transactions. There are no transactions or series of
related transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are
there any currently proposed transactions or series of related transactions,
between Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or
former director or "executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) of Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who
beneficially owns (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) 5%
or more of the outstanding Yadkin Common Stock (or any of such person's

of Yadkin has received an opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has

of view to Yadkin. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the
date of this Agreement.

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(a) amend the Yadkin Certificate or Yadkin Bylaws in a manner that would
adversely affect the economic benefits of the Merger to the holders of
NewBridge Common Stock;

  

  

(b) adjust, split, combine or reclassify any capital stock of Yadkin;

  

  

(c) make, declare or pay any dividend, or make any other distribution on, or
directly or indirectly redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, any shares of
its capital stock or any securities or obligations convertible (whether
currently convertible or convertible only after the passage of time or the
occurrence of certain events) into or exchangeable for any shares of its
capital stock (except (A) regular quarterly cash dividends by Yadkin at a rate
not in excess of $0.10 per share of Yadkin Common Stock, (B) an extraordinary
dividend of $0.50 per share of Yadkin Common Stock, (C) dividends paid by any
of the Subsidiaries of Yadkin to Yadkin or any of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, or (D) the acceptance of shares of Yadkin Common Stock as
payment for the exercise price of Yadkin Stock Options or for withholding
taxes incurred in connection with the exercise of Yadkin Stock Options or the
vesting or settlement of Yadkin Equity Awards, in each case in accordance with
past practice and the terms of the applicable award agreements);

  

  

(d) take any action that is intended or reasonably expected to result in any
of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or
becoming untrue in any material respect at any time prior to the Effective
Time, or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not
being satisfied or in a violation of any provision of this Agreement, except,
in every case, as may be required by applicable law or applicable rules,
regulations and policies of any Regulatory Agency;

  

  

(e) take any action that is intended or reasonably expected to prevent,
materially impede, materially impact or materially delay the ability of the
parties to obtain any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals;

  

  

(f) take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, where such action
or failure to act could reasonably be expected to prevent the Integrated
Mergers, taken together, from being treated as an integrated transaction that
qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code; or

  

  

(g) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of
its board of directors or similar governing body in support of, any of the
actions prohibited by this Section 5.3.

  

  

5.4 Tax-free Reorganization. Officers of Yadkin, Merger Sub and NewBridge
shall execute and deliver to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP and to
Brooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey and Leonard, LLP, respectively, certificates
containing appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to such counsel, at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by such counsel, including the effective date of the
Joint Proxy Statement and the Closing Date, in connection with such counsel's
deliveries of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the Integrated
Mergers.

ARTICLE VI 
 

  

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

6.1 Regulatory Matters.

  

  

(a) Yadkin and NewBridge shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no
later than thirty (30) business days after of the date of this Agreement, the
Joint Proxy Statement and Yadkin shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC
the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus,
and any amendment thereto, if any. Each of Yadkin and NewBridge shall
cooperate in respect of the form and content of any other communication with
shareholders of NewBridge. Each of Yadkin and NewBridge shall use their
reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Yadkin and
NewBridge shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their
respective shareholders. Yadkin shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
NewBridge shall furnish all information concerning NewBridge and the holders
of NewBridge Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly (and in the case of the regulatory
applications to the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the NC Commissioner
within thirty (30) business days of the date of this Agreement) prepare and
file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger and
the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental
Entities. Yadkin and NewBridge shall have the right to review in advance, and,
to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information (and
subject to necessary redactions relating to confidential or sensitive
information), all the information relating to NewBridge or Yadkin, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that
they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
herein. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any formal
meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity and deemed appropriate by such party, in its sole
discretion, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to require Yadkin or NewBridge to

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 

take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to
NewBridge) on any of Yadkin, NewBridge or the Surviving Corporation, after
giving effect to the Merger (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition").

  

  

(c) Yadkin and NewBridge shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Yadkin,
NewBridge or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Yadkin and NewBridge shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the
"Requisite Regulatory Approvals" shall mean all regulatory authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals from (x) the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and
the NC Commissioner and (y) any other approvals set forth in Sections 3.4 and
4.4 which are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger or those the failure of
which to be obtained would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

6.2 Access to Information.

  

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Yadkin and
NewBridge, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and
other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records
(excluding Yadkin's Tax Returns and related workpapers), and each shall
cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective
Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally,
and, during such period, each of Yadkin and NewBridge shall, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or
documents which Yadkin or NewBridge, as the case may be, is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request.
Neither Yadkin nor NewBridge nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Yadkin's or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

   
 

NewBridge's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  

  

(b) Each of Yadkin and NewBridge shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such party's Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated August 10, 2015, between Yadkin and NewBridge (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

  

  

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  

  

6.3 Shareholders' Approvals. Each of Yadkin and NewBridge shall call a meeting
of its shareholders (the "Yadkin Meeting" and the "NewBridge Meeting,"
respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is
declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite NewBridge Vote
and the Requisite Yadkin Vote required in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the
type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders
to approve a merger agreement or otherwise approve the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date.
The Board of Directors of each of Yadkin and NewBridge shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Yadkin and
NewBridge, as the case may be, the Requisite Yadkin Vote, in the case of
Yadkin, and the Requisite NewBridge Vote, in the case of NewBridge, including
by communicating to its respective shareholders its recommendation (and
including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve
(i) this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the case of
NewBridge and (ii) the issuance of shares of Yadkin Common Stock in connection
with the Merger, in the case of Yadkin. However, subject to Section 8.1 and
Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of NewBridge or Yadkin, after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably
likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law
to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to
its shareholders, such Board of Directors may (but shall not be required to)
submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law; provided, that the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Board of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it
gives the other party at least three (3) business days' prior written notice
of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event
or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors of
NewBridge in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms
and conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in
reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment
to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as
referred to in this Section 6.3. Yadkin or NewBridge shall adjourn the Yadkin
Meeting or the NewBridge Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for
which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of
Yadkin Common Stock or NewBridge Common Stock, as the case may be, represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting NewBridge or
Yadkin, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite NewBridge Vote or the
Requisite Yadkin Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the
Yadkin Meeting and NewBridge Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of each of Yadkin and NewBridge at the
Yadkin Meeting and the NewBridge Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of
voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the issuance of shares of Yadkin
Common Stock in connection with the Merger, as applicable, and the other
matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve either Yadkin or NewBridge of such obligation.

  

  

6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this
Agreement, each of Yadkin and NewBridge shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by NewBridge or Yadkin or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

6.5 Stock Exchange Listing. Yadkin shall cause the shares of Yadkin Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

6.6 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) All individuals employed by, or on an authorized leave of absence from,
NewBridge and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Continuing Employees") shall automatically become employees of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. During the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof,
Yadkin shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the
Continuing Employees, while employed by Yadkin or its Subsidiaries, with base
salaries, wages and employee benefits (excluding equity and equity based
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the base
salaries, wages and employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Yadkin and its Subsidiaries; provided that Yadkin may satisfy its
obligation under this Section 6.6(a) by providing or causing the Surviving
Corporation to provide such Continuing Employees with base salaries, wages and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
base salaries, wages and employee benefits provided by NewBridge or its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  

  

(b) If a Continuing Employee who does not have an employment, change-of-
control or severance agreement with NewBridge (i) is terminated by Yadkin or
any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time due to a permanent or
indefinite reduction in staff resulting in job elimination, reduction of a
position (including a position that had been held at NewBridge) as the result
of the Merger or an organizational or business restructuring or the
integration of NewBridge with Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries,
discontinuance of an operation, relocation of all or a part of Yadkin's or its
Subsidiaries' business, sale of an operation to another company, or sale or
other change in ownership of all or a part of Yadkin's or its Subsidiaries'
business or (ii) voluntarily resigns after being notified that, as a condition
of employment, such Continuing Employee's base salary, wages and employee
benefits will be materially decreased, in any case or both cases, during the
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending one (1) year following the
Effective Time, such Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive
severance payments (conditioned on such Continuing Employee's execution and
non-revocation of a release of claims in a form acceptable to Yadkin) equal to
one (1) week of pay for every year of service with NewBridge (including
service with the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), with a minimum
of four (4) weeks and a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of pay for those
Continuing Employees with one (1) year or more of service with NewBridge
(including service with the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries). Those
Continuing Employees with less than one (1) year of service with NewBridge
(including service with the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall
be entitled to receive severance payments equal to four (4) weeks of pay.

  

  

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Yadkin or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), Yadkin shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under
any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting periods would apply under the analogous NewBridge Benefit Plan,
(ii) provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 

prior to the Effective Time under a NewBridge Benefit Plan (to the same extent
that such credit was given under the analogous NewBridge Benefit Plan prior to
the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such
employees with NewBridge and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan
to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous NewBridge Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for
purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides
retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or
provides grandfathered benefits.

  

  

(d) Unless Yadkin requests otherwise in writing, effective prior to the
Closing, NewBridge shall terminate the NewBridge Bank Employees' 401(k) Plan
(the "Terminated Plan"). NewBridge shall provide Yadkin with resolutions
adopted by NewBridge's board of directors terminating the Terminated Plan, the
form and substance of which shall be subject to the reasonable advance
approval of Yadkin. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, with
respect to the Terminated Plan, Yadkin shall permit or cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to permit the Continuing Employees to
roll over their account balances and outstanding loan balances, if any,
thereunder into an "eligible retirement plan" within the meaning of Section
402(c)(8)(B) of the Code maintained by Yadkin or its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation).

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director, independent contractor or consultant of NewBridge or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
the Surviving Corporation, NewBridge, Yadkin or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Surviving Corporation, NewBridge, Yadkin or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer,
director or consultant of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any NewBridge
Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any particular NewBridge Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit
or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the third sentence of Section 9.10,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person, including without limitation any current or former employee,
officer, director, independent contractor or consultant (or any spouse or
dependent of such individual) of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  

  

6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Yadkin and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director, officer or employee of NewBridge and its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "NewBridge Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective
Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer
or employee of NewBridge or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the same extent as such persons
are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by NewBridge pursuant to the
NewBridge Certificate, NewBridge Bylaws, the governing or organizational
documents of any Subsidiary of NewBridge; and Yadkin and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such NewBridge
Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are entitled to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by NewBridge pursuant
to the NewBridge Certificate, NewBridge's Bylaws, the governing or
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of NewBridge; provided, that, if
required, the NewBridge Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such NewBridge Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

  

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by NewBridge
(provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 200% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
NewBridge for such insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the
Surviving Corporation's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, NewBridge, in consultation with Yadkin, may (and at the request of
Yadkin, NewBridge shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior
to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under NewBridge's existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium
Cap.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
NewBridge Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7.

  

  

6.8 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 

without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of Yadkin, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of NewBridge, on the other) or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Yadkin.

  

  

6.9 Advice of Changes. Yadkin and NewBridge shall each promptly (but in no
event more than 24 hours) advise the other party of any change or event (i)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it
or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

  

  

6.10 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of Yadkin and NewBridge
shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of
Yadkin Common Stock and NewBridge Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that holders of NewBridge Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or
fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of
NewBridge Common Stock and any shares of Yadkin Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

  

  

6.11 Corporate Governance. Effective as of the Effective Time, Yadkin shall
(i) increase the size of the Board of Directors of Yadkin to fifteen (15)
members, (ii) appoint five (5) current members of the Board of Directors of
NewBridge, to be designated by NewBridge and approved by Yadkin, to the Board
of Directors of Yadkin and Yadkin Bank for the period until the next annual
meeting of shareholders of Yadkin, (iii) if the Effective Time shall occur
prior to the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, subject to the good faith
consideration by the Nominating, Compensation, and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Board of Directors of Yadkin of the selection criteria set
forth in its charter, such designated persons shall be nominated to sit for
election by the shareholders of Yadkin to a regular term on the Board of
Yadkin at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, and if so elected, cause
such persons to be appointed to the Board of Directors of Yadkin Bank, in each
case to continue to serve until immediately before the 2017 annual meeting of
shareholders of Yadkin, and (iv) appoint an appropriate number of such
NewBridge designated members to the Yadkin Executive Committee such that,
until immediately before the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders of Yadkin,
the pro forma representation of the Board of Directors of Yadkin and the
Yadkin Executive Committee are equivalent with the foregoing, or as close as
possible to equivalent. The Boards of Directors of Yadkin and Yadkin Bank
shall take appropriate actions to permit such nominations and service under
their respective Bylaws. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Board of Directors
of Yadkin is comprised of fifteen (15) members and five (5) are designated
pursuant to clause (ii) above, and the Yadkin Executive Committee is comprised
of six (6) members, two (2) of the six

(6) members of the Yadkin Executive Committee would be former members of the
Board of Directors of NewBridge.

  

  

6.12 Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) NewBridge agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with
any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any
person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such person of
the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.12(a); provided, that, prior
to obtaining the Requisite NewBridge Vote, in the event NewBridge receives an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to
take such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, NewBridge shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with NewBridge. NewBridge
will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any person other than Yadkin with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to
applicable law, to (x) enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and (y) within ten (10) business
days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of
any confidential information provided to any person (other than Yadkin)
pursuant to such agreement. NewBridge will promptly (within twenty-four (24)
hours) advise Yadkin following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal and copies of any written Acquisition
Proposal), and will keep Yadkin apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to
or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. As used in
this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or
any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of NewBridge and
its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
NewBridge or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of NewBridge, (ii) any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of NewBridge or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of
the consolidated assets of NewBridge, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 

liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving NewBridge or
its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
more than 25% of the consolidated assets of NewBridge.

  

  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent NewBridge or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  

  

6.13 Public Announcements. NewBridge and Yadkin shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan, to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

  

6.14 Change of Method. NewBridge and Yadkin shall be empowered, upon their
mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the
method or structure of effecting the combination of NewBridge and Yadkin
(including the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem
such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided, however, that
no such change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the number of
shares of Yadkin Common Stock received by NewBridge shareholders in exchange
for each share of NewBridge Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax
treatment of NewBridge's shareholders or Yadkin's shareholders pursuant to
this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of NewBridge or
Yadkin pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely
manner. The Parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with
Section 8.3.

  

  

6.15 Restructuring Efforts. If either NewBridge or Yadkin shall have failed to
obtain the Requisite NewBridge Vote or the Requisite Yadkin Vote at the duly
convened NewBridge Meeting or Yadkin Meeting, as applicable, or any
adjournment thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions
provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any
obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind
of the consideration to be issued to NewBridge's shareholders as provided for
in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders)
and/or resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as
restructured pursuant to this Section 6.15) to its respective shareholders for
approval.

  

  

6.16 Takeover Statutes. None of NewBridge, Yadkin or their respective Boards
of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable
Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

  

  

6.17 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). NewBridge and Yadkin agree
that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain NewBridge Insiders
(as defined below), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that NewBridge Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of NewBridge Common
Stock and NewBridge Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.17. Assuming
NewBridge delivers to Yadkin in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the
Effective Time accurate information regarding those officers and directors of
NewBridge subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 (a) of the
Exchange Act (the "NewBridge Insiders"), the Board of Directors of Yadkin and
of NewBridge, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time,
take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of NewBridge) any
dispositions of NewBridge Common Stock or NewBridge Equity Awards by the
NewBridge Insiders, and (in the case of Yadkin) any acquisitions of Yadkin
Common Stock by any NewBridge Insiders who, immediately following the Merger,
will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

  

  

6.18 Assumption of Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debt. Yadkin
and NewBridge shall take all actions necessary to effect, immediately prior to
and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, the assumption by Yadkin
(or a Subsidiary thereof) of the trust preferred securities and subordinated
debt of NewBridge (or its Subsidiaries) listed on Section 6.18 of the
NewBridge Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the applicable terms thereof
and the documents and agreements related thereto.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

  

  

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the obtainment of the Requisite
NewBridge Vote or the Requisite Yadkin Vote:

  

  

(a) by mutual consent of Yadkin and NewBridge in a written instrument, if the
Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

  

  

(b) by either the Board of Directors of Yadkin or the Board of Directors of
NewBridge if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to
the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

  

  

(c) by either the Board of Directors of Yadkin or the Board of Directors of
NewBridge if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the one
(1) year anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "Termination Date"),
unless the failure of the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein;

  

  

(d) by either the Board of Directors of Yadkin or the Board of Directors of
NewBridge (provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein)
if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any
of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty
shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of NewBridge,
in the case of a termination by Yadkin, or Yadkin, in the case of a
termination by NewBridge, which breach or failure to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or
failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute,
if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Yadkin, or 7.3, in the
case of a termination by NewBridge, and which is not cured within forty-five
(45) days following written notice to NewBridge, in the case of a termination
by Yadkin, or Yadkin, in the case of a termination by NewBridge, or by its
nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as
remain prior to the Termination Date);

  

  

(e) by NewBridge, if the Board of Directors of Yadkin shall have (i) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of Yadkin approve
the issuance of shares of Yadkin Common Stock in connection with the Merger,
or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to
NewBridge, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such recommendation
within two (2) business days after NewBridge requests in writing that such
action be taken, or failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer
or exchange offer for outstanding Yadkin Common Stock that has been publicly
disclosed (other than by NewBridge or an affiliate of NewBridge) within ten
(10) business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, in
any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, (ii) recommended
or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) breached its obligations under
Section 6.3 in any material respect;

  

  

(f) by Yadkin, if the Board of Directors of NewBridge shall have (i) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of NewBridge
adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation
in a manner adverse to Yadkin, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm
such recommendation within two (2) business days after Yadkin requests in
writing that such action be taken, or failed to recommend against acceptance
of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding NewBridge Common Stock
that has been publicly disclosed (other than by Yadkin or an affiliate of
Yadkin) within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof,
(ii) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) breached its
obligations under Sections 6.3 or 6.12 in any material respect;

  

  

(g) By Yadkin, if NewBridge shall have failed to obtain the Requisite
NewBridge Vote at the duly convened NewBridge Meeting or at any adjournment
thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was taken; or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(h) By NewBridge, if Yadkin shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Yadkin
Vote at the duly convened Yadkin Meeting or at any adjournment thereof at
which a vote on the issuance of shares of Yadkin Common Stock in connection
with the Merger was taken.

  

  

8.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Yadkin or
NewBridge as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Yadkin, NewBridge, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) and
this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.1) shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Yadkin nor NewBridge shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management or Board of Directors of NewBridge or has
been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
NewBridge and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Yadkin or
NewBridge pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and NewBridge shall have failed to obtain
the Requisite NewBridge Vote at the duly convened NewBridge Meeting or any
adjournment thereof at which a vote on the approval of this Agreement was
taken or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Yadkin pursuant to
Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the
date of such termination, NewBridge enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then NewBridge
shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and
the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Yadkin, by wire transfer of
same day funds, (x) a fee equal to $18,000,000 (the "Termination Fee");
provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%" and
(y) an amount equal to the documented out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred
by Yadkin in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the execution, negotiation and diligence thereof (the "Yadkin
Expenses").

  

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by NewBridge pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then Yadkin shall, on the date of termination, pay NewBridge,
by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee and an amount equal to
the documented out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by NewBridge in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
execution, negotiation and diligence thereof (the "NewBridge Expenses").

  

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Yadkin pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then NewBridge shall, on the date of termination, pay Yadkin,
by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee and Yadkin Expenses.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Yadkin pursuant to
Section 8.1(g), then NewBridge shall pay Yadkin, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Yadkin Expenses on the date of termination.

  

  

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by NewBridge pursuant to
Section 8.1(h), then Yadkin shall pay NewBridge, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the NewBridge Expenses on the date of termination.

  

  

(g) Each of Yadkin and NewBridge acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter
into this Agreement. The amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole monetary
remedy of the party receiving such payments, but without limiting the right of
any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other party's
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement (with Yadkin
and its Subsidiaries, and NewBridge and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, being
deemed to be one party for such purposes) in the event of termination of this
Agreement specified in Section 8.1 hereto; accordingly, if Yadkin or NewBridge
fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results
in a final, non-appealable judgment against the non-paying party for the
Termination Fee, the Yadkin Expenses or the NewBridge Expenses, as applicable,
such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and actually incurred and documented
out-of-pocket expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Yadkin
or NewBridge, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts
at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase
and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment
was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

  

  

8.3 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of Yadkin and
NewBridge; provided, however, that after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of NewBridge or the approval of the issuance of shares of Yadkin
Common Stock in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Yadkin,
there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment
of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

  

8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and waive compliance with any of the
agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; provided,
however, that after adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of
NewBridge or the approval of the issuance of shares of Yadkin Common Stock in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Yadkin,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any extension
or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further
approval under applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

9.5 Interpretation. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and
drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." References to "the date hereof"
shall mean the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
"knowledge" of NewBridge means the actual knowledge (after due enquiry) of any
of the officers of NewBridge listed on Section 9.5 of the NewBridge Disclosure
Schedule, and the "knowledge" of Yadkin means the actual knowledge (after due
enquiry) of any of the officers of Yadkin listed on Section 9.5 of the Yadkin
Disclosure Schedule. As used herein, (i) the term "person" means any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature, (ii) an "affiliate" of a specified person is any person that directly
or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

with, such specified person and (iii) the term "made available" means any
document or other information that was (a) provided in writing by one party or
its representatives to the other party and its representatives prior to the
date hereof, (b) included in the virtual data room of a party prior to the
date hereof or (c) filed by a party with the SEC and publicly available on
EDGAR prior to the date hereof. The NewBridge Disclosure Schedule and the
Yadkin Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits
hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference
to this Agreement.

  

  

9.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

  

  

9.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

  

9.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of North Carolina, without regard to any applicable conflicts of
law.

  

  

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court sitting in
Raleigh, North Carolina (the "Chosen Courts"), and, solely in connection with
claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject
of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such
action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the
Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any
party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 9.4.

  

  

9.9 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV)

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 

EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.9.

  

  

9.10 Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

  

  

9.11 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties' obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

  

  

9.12 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

  

9.13 Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement,
and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
