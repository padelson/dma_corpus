par value $.10 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") or (y) shares
of Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $.10 per share, of Parent
(the "Parent Preferred Stock"), (ii) each  ------------------------ issued

contemplated hereby; and      WHEREAS, in the case that the Merger is a

federal income tax purposes that the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),  ---- and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 368 of the
Code.   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the
mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties herein
contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE
MERGER  SECTION 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set  ----------- forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and the Indiana Business
Corporation Law (the "IBCL"), at the  ---- ---- Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.02):   (a) If, (i) on the last trading day preceding the
Closing Date, the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange (the "Closing Stock Price") is $29.00 or greater per
share, or (ii) the Closing  ------------------- Stock Price is less than
$29.00 per share, but Parent receives the tax opinion described in Section
6.01(j), and the Company shall so elect, the Company shall be merged with and
into Acquisition Subsidiary (the "Forward Merger"). After 
--------------- giving effect to the Forward Merger, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall cease and Acquisition Subsidiary shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Forward Merger Surviving
Corporation"), and Acquisition 
--------------------------------------- Subsidiary shall succeed to and
assume all the rights and obligations of the Company in accordance with the
DGCL; or   (b) If the condition to a Forward Merger pursuant to Section
1.01(a) above is not satisfied, Acquisition Subsidiary shall be merged with
and into the Company (the "Reverse Merger"). After giving effect to the
Reverse Merger, the  --------------- separate corporate existence of
Acquisition Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the "Reverse Merger  --------------- Surviving
Corporation"), and the Company shall succeed to and assume all
the ---------------------- rights and obligations of Acquisition Subsidiary
in accordance with the IBCL.   For purposes of this Agreement (i) the term
"Merger" shall mean either  ------ the Forward Merger or the Reverse Merger,
whichever is applicable, and (ii) the term "Surviving Corporation" shall mean
either the Forward Merger Surviving  ---------------------- Corporation or
the Reverse Merger Surviving Corporation, whichever is applicable.  SECTION
1.02 Effective Time. The parties shall prepare, execute and deliver a 
-------------- certificate of merger and/or other appropriate documents in
substantially the form(s) annexed hereto as Exhibit 1.02 (in any such case,
the "Certificate of  ------------ --------------- Merger") in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the IBCL and ------ file same
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Secretary of
State of the State of Indiana, respectively. The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (in the case of the Forward
Merger) or the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana (in the case of the
Reverse Merger) or at such subsequent time or date as Parent and the Company
shall agree and   2   specify in the Certificate of Merger. The time at
which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Effective Time". In addition,  -------------- in the case that the Merger
is a Reverse Merger, Parent shall cause the Certificate of Designation (as
defined in Section 2.01(a)(ii)(B)) to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware at the Effective Time.  SECTION 1.03 Effects of the
Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the 
---------------------- Surviving Corporation shall succeed to and possess,
without further act or deed, all of the estate, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises, both public and private, and all of the property, real,
personal, and mixed, of the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary; all debts due
to the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary shall be vested in the Surviving
Corporation; all claims, demands, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises and every other interest of the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary
shall be as effectively the property of the Surviving Corporation as they
were of the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary, respectively; the title to
any real estate vested by deed or otherwise in the Company and Acquisition
Subsidiary shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the
Merger, but shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation; all rights of
creditors and all liens upon any property of the Company and Acquisition
Subsidiary shall be preserved unimpaired, limited in lien to the property
affected by such lien at the Effective Time of the Merger; and all debts,
liabilities, and duties of the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary
shall thenceforth attach to the Surviving Corporation and may be enforced
against it to the same extent as if such debts, liabilities and duties had
been incurred or contracted by it.  SECTION 1.04 Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws.  ----------------------------------------   (a)
The Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition Subsidiary, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.   (b) The By-laws of
Acquisition Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.  SECTION 1.05 Directors.
The directors of Acquisition Subsidiary immediately  --------- prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.  SECTION 1.06 Officers.
The officers of the Acquisition Subsidiary immediately  -------- prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be;
provided, that H.  -------- Coleman Davis, III shall be appointed as the
President of the Surviving Corporation effective immediately after the
Effective Time.  SECTION 1.07 Tax Consequences. In the case that the Merger
is a Forward  ----------------- Merger, it is intended by the parties hereto
that, for U.S. federal income tax   3    purposes, the Merger shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and that each of Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the Company shall
be a party, within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, to the
"reorganization." In such case, the parties hereto hereby adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations.
Accordingly, both prior to and after the Closing Date, the books and records
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be maintained, and all tax
returns and schedules thereto shall be filed, in a manner consistent with the
Merger being qualified as a tax-free merger under Section 368(a) of the Code
(unless a court of competent jurisdiction renders a determination (as defined
in Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code) that the Merger does not qualify as such).
Each party hereto shall provide to each of the other parties hereto such
information, reports, returns and schedules as may reasonably be required to
assist in accounting or reporting the Merger as being so qualified.

----------------------------------------- consideration to be paid by Parent
or Acquisition Subsidiary (i) for all of the shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock, (ii) in respect of all Company Stock Options and
(iii) on account of the Company Expense Payments pursuant to Section
13.01(b), shall be One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000) (the
"Merger Consideration"), which amount shall be subject to 
--------------------- adjustment in accordance with Section 2.04. The Merger

the Merger Consideration  (the "Cash Portion") shall be paid in cash, without

Merger Consideration  (the "Stock Portion") shall be paid as follows: 
-------------    (A) In the case that the Merger is a Forward Merger,  the
Stock Portion shall be that number of shares of  Parent Common Stock
determined by dividing (x) the  amount of the Stock Portion by (y) $30.00
(the "Common  ------  Stock Stated Value"); or  ------------------   (B)
In the case that the Merger is a Reverse Merger,  the Stock Portion shall be
that number of shares of  Parent Preferred Stock, having the rights, powers
and  preferences set forth in the Certificate of Designation  substantially
in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit 2.01  ------------  (the "Certificate
of Designation"), determined by  -----------------------------  dividing (x)
the amount of the Stock Portion by (y)  $100.00 (the "Preferred Stock Stated
Value").  ----------------------------   4    The ratio of the Cash
Portion to the Stock Portion (i.e., 55% to 45%) is referred to herein as the
"Cash/Stock Ratio".  ----------------   (b) Payment of Merger
Consideration. Subject to Section 2.05, the 
-------------------------------- Merger Consideration shall be paid as
follows:   (i) in cash, in payment of the Company Expense Payments 
pursuant to Section 13.01(b);   (ii) in cash, to (A) the holders of the
Company Redeemable  Preferred Stock, on a per share basis, the original
purchase  price of such Company Redeemable Preferred Stock of $100.00 per 
share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Company  Redeemable
Preferred Stock through and including the Closing  Date (as defined in
Section 7.01), and (B) the holders of the  Company Convertible Preferred
Stock, on a per share basis, all  accrued and unpaid dividends on such
Company Convertible  Preferred Stock through and including the Closing
Date;   (iii) in cash and either Parent Common Stock or Parent  Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, (in accordance with the  Adjusted Cash/Stock
Ratio, as defined below), to the holders of  the Company Stock Options, an
amount in respect thereof equal to  the product of (A) the excess of the
Merger Consideration Per  Common Share (as defined below) over the exercise
price thereof,  if any, and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject  thereto (such payment to be net of taxes required by law to be 
withheld with respect thereto). For purposes hereof, the "Merger  ------ 
Consideration Per Common Share" shall mean the quotient obtained 
------------------------------  by dividing (A) the sum of (x) the Merger
Consideration (as  adjusted pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(i)), less the amounts
paid  pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above, and (y) the aggregate 
exercise price of all Company Stock Options vested and  exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B) the  sum of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued  and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (y) the  number of shares of Company Convertible
Preferred Stock issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time  (calculated on an as-converted basis), and (z) the number of  shares
of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the  Company Stock Options
prior to the Effective Time, assuming the  full vesting and exercise of such
Company Stock Options; and   (iv) in cash and either Parent Common Stock or
Parent  Preferred Stock, as the case may be, (in accordance with the 
Adjusted Cash/Stock Ratio), to the holders of Company Common  Stock and
Company Convertible Preferred Stock (calculated on an  as-converted basis,
after giving effect to the payment of any  dividends thereon pursuant to
clause (ii)(B) above), on a per  share basis, the excess of (A) the Merger
Consideration (as  adjusted pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(i)) over (B) the
aggregate   5    of the portion of the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to  clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 2.01(b).   For the
purposes of this Agreement, the "Adjusted Cash/Stock Ratio" 
--------------------------- shall mean the ratio of (A) the Cash Portion,
less (x) the Company Expense Payments made pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(i) and
Section 13.01(b) and (y) payments in respect of the Company Redeemable
Preferred Stock and accrued and unpaid dividends on the Company Redeemable
Preferred Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock made pursuant to
Section 2.01(b)(ii), to (B) the Stock Portion.   (c) Calculation of
Payments; Method of Payment. Not later than two 
------------------------------------------- (2) business days prior to the
Closing, the Holder Representatives shall give Parent and Acquisition
Subsidiary a notice stating the amounts payable pursuant to each of clauses
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Section 2.01(b), together with the names and tax
identification numbers of the recipients of each of the Cash Portion and the
Stock Portion. Subject to Section 2.05, all payments of the Stock Portion
shall be made by delivery of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent
Common Stock (in the case of a Forward Merger) or Parent Preferred Stock (in
the case of a Reverse Merger). Subject to Section 2.05, all payments of the
Cash Portion shall be paid on the Closing Date by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the
Holder Representatives not later than two (2) business days prior to the
Closing.  SECTION 2.02 Cancellation and Conversion of the Capital Stock and
Stock 
---------------------------------------------------------------- Options of
the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary. At the Effective Time,
by --------------------------------------------------- virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital
stock of the Company, Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary:   (a) Capital Stock
of Acquisition Subsidiary. Each issued and 
------------------------------------------- outstanding share of common stock
of Acquisition Subsidiary shall be converted into and shall become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Each share of
Company Common  -------------------------------- Stock that is owned by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of
the Company Redeemable Preferred Stock. Each share 
---------------------------------------------------- of Company Redeemable
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted, on a per share basis, into the right to receive, in
cash, the amounts described in Section 2.01(b)(ii)(A).   (d) Cancellation of
the Company Stock Options. Immediately prior to 
----------------------------------------- the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or not then exercisable or vested,
shall become fully exercisable and vested. At the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option which is then issued and outstanding shall be canceled
and in consideration of such cancellation, Parent shall pay to the holders of
the Company Stock Options the amounts described in   6   Section
2.01(b)(iii). No payment shall be made with respect to any Company
Stock Option having an exercise price greater than the Merger Consideration
Per Common Share.   (e) Conversion of the Company Common Stock and Company
Convertible 
---------------------------------------------------------------- Preferred
Stock. All of the shares of the Company Common Stock and
Company ---------------- Convertible Preferred Stock (calculated on an as-
converted basis) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.02(b))
shall be converted, on a per share basis, into the right to receive the
amounts described in Section 2.01(b)(iv). In addition, the holders of Company
Convertible Preferred Stock shall receive the amounts specified in Section
2.01(b)(ii)(B).  SECTION 2.03 Exchange Procedure; Payment. 
---------------------------   (a) Exchange Procedure. At the Effective Time
all shares of Company  ------------------ Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a "Certificate") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto,  ----------- except the right
to receive its allocable share of the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Sections 2.01 and 2.02. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation, the
Shareholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash and/or either Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case
may be, into which the shares formerly represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to Sections 2.02(c) and (e) and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.   (b) Fractional Shares. In no
event shall any fractional share of  ------------------ Parent Common Stock
or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, be issued pursuant to this
Article II. Instead, each Holder who otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, shall receive an amount of cash equal to the product of the same
fraction multiplied by the Common Stock Stated Value or the Preferred Stock
Stated Value, as the case may be.   (c) Adjustments. Any shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued  ----------- hereunder shall be of Parent Common
Stock as constituted on the date hereof, and such shares shall be
appropriately adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or
reclassifications of shares, reorganization, recapitalization or other
similar change in such common stock occurring between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, if any.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock or Company 
---------------------------------------------------------------- Preferred
Stock. All cash and Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock,
as ---------------- the case may be, paid upon the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate.   (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost,  ------------------ stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent shall pay in   7   respect of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration.   (f)
Dividends in Connection with Parent Common Stock and Parent 
---------------------------------------------------------------- Preferred
Stock. Dividends or other distributions made in connection with
Parent --------------- Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case
may be, shall be distributed only to those of the Holders who have
surrendered their Certificates or whose Company Stock Options have been
canceled and who have received Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, therefor in accordance with this Article II.   (g)
Withholding Rights. Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall be 
------------------ entitled to deduct and withhold from the Cash Portion of
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or of
Company Stock Options such amounts as Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or any
Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary.  SECTION 2.04 Adjustment of
Merger Consideration.  ----------------------------------   (a) The Merger
Consideration will be adjusted upward or downward, on a dollar for dollar
basis, to the extent that the Company\'s shareholder equity as of the Closing
Date as finally determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"), applied on a consistent basis, except  ---- as
otherwise set forth in Sections 2.04(c) and 13.01(c) ("Shareholder Equity") 
------------------- is greater than or less than Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000). The Shareholder Equity shall be determined as follows:   (i)
For purposes of determining the amount of the Merger  Consideration to be
paid on the Closing Date, the Shareholder  Equity will be determined in the
same manner as it is to be  determined in preparing the Audited Closing
Balance Sheet (as  defined below), except that it shall be based upon the
unaudited  balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2001 (the 
"Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"). The Company shall deliver  the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet to Parent and Acquisition  Subsidiary not later than
three (3) business days prior to the  Closing.   (ii) In order to
conclusively determine the Shareholder  Equity as of the Closing Date,
Parent, with the cooperation of  the Holders, will cause a balance sheet of
the Company as of the  Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") to be
prepared as  -----------------------  promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date and Parent  will engage Deloitte and Touche LLP ("DandT;") to audit
the Closing  ---  Balance Sheet (as audited, the "Audited Closing Balance
Sheet").  -----------------------------   8    The Audited Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared based upon  the Company\'s books and records
in accordance with GAAP, applied  on a consistent basis, except as otherwise
set forth in Sections  2.04(c) and 13.01(c). The parties will use their
reasonable best  efforts to cause DandT; to complete and deliver the Audited
Closing  Balance Sheet to Parent and the Holder Representatives within 
sixty (60) days after DandT;\'s receipt of the Closing Balance  Sheet. The
parties shall cooperate with DandT; in connection with  such audit, and shall
provide DandT; with all books, records and  other papers necessary for such
purpose.   (iii) The Audited Closing Balance Sheet shall be final and 
binding on the parties, unless within thirty (30) days after  receipt thereof
the Holder Representatives shall give Parent a  notice of objection (an
"Objection Notice"). The Objection  -----------------  Notice shall specify
each item the Holders object to in the  Audited Closing Balance Sheet,
together with a calculation of  each disputed amount, and shall include all
supporting  calculations and data used in that determination. Any item in 
the Audited Closing Balance Sheet that is not objected to in the  Objection
Notice shall be deemed agreed and shall be final and  binding on the
parties.   (iv) In the event an Objection Notice is given, Parent and  the
Holder Representatives, together with DandT; and the Company\'s  auditors,
Ernst and Young LLP ("EandY;"), shall meet in an effort to  ---  resolve any
objection and arrive at a final determination. If  Parent and the Holder
Representatives are unable to arrive at a  final determination within ten
(10) days after an Objection  Notice is given, the matter shall be submitted
for final  determination to a firm of independent certified public 
accountants upon which the Holder Representatives and Parent  mutually agree
(the "Independent Firm"). The Independent Firm  -----------------  shall
make a final determination in writing as to all matters in  dispute within
thirty (30) days after its appointment; and such  determination shall be
final and binding on the parties;  provided that notwithstanding the
Independent Firm\'s  --------  determination of the Shareholder Equity, for
purposes hereof the  Shareholder Equity shall be neither less than the
amount  specified in the Audited Closing Balance Sheet nor greater than  the
amount specified in the Objection Notice.   (v) Parent shall pay any fees
owing to DandT; in connection  with this Section, and the Holders shall pay any
fees owing to  EandY; in connection with this Section. Any fees owing to the 
Independent Firm in connection with this Section shall be paid  in direct
proportion to the amounts of the disputed items that  are lost by the Holders
or Parent, as the case may be.   (b) Method of Adjustment. In the event that
the Shareholder Equity  -------------------- as finally determined pursuant
to this Section is greater than the Shareholder Equity as determined pursuant
to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Parent will pay such difference to
the Holders in additional cash and Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, which shall be paid in   9   accordance with
the Cash/Stock Ratio, with the value of the Parent Common Stock to be based
on the Common Stock Stated Value and the value of the Parent Preferred Stock
to be based on the Preferred Stock Stated Value; provided, 
-------- however, if payments made under this Section 2.04(b) in accordance
with the ------- Cash/Stock Ratio would result in the total number of shares
of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock (calculated on an as-
converted basis) being delivered pursuant to this Article II to exceed
2,250,000 shares, Parent, at its option, may elect to pay cash in lieu of
Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, for any
shares in excess thereof (at a per share price equal to the Common Stock
Stated Value or the Preferred Stock Stated Value, as the case may be);
provided, further, that any such election by Parent  -------- ------- shall
be limited to such extent as is necessary so that the Forward Merger
(if applicable) shall have the tax consequences described in Section 1.07.
Any such payment to the Holders shall be paid to the Holders, pro rata, based
on the  --- ---- respective portion of the Merger Consideration that each
Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Sections 2.01(b)(iii) and (iv). In
the event that the Shareholder Equity as finally determined pursuant to this
Section is less than the Shareholder Equity as determined pursuant to the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, such difference shall be withdrawn from the
Escrowed Funds (as defined below) in accordance with the Cash/Stock Ratio,
with the value of the Parent Common Stock to be based on the Common Stock
Stated Value and the value of the Parent Preferred Stock to be based on the
Preferred Stock Stated Value, and delivered to Parent in accordance with
Section 2.05(a)(i).   (c) Shareholder Equity. For purposes of determining
Shareholder  ------------------- Equity, (i) the Shareholder Equity shall be
increased by the amount of any Tax Benefit (as defined below) the Company or
the Surviving Corporation arising out of or attributable to the exercise (or
cancellation pursuant to Section 2.02(d)) of the Company Stock Options
(whether or not permitted by GAAP), (ii) the Company Redeemable Preferred
Stock, and any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Company Redeemable
Preferred Stock and on the Company Convertible Preferred Stock (whether or
not declared), shall be included in the calculation of Shareholder Equity,
(iii) the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Audited Closing Balance
Sheet shall not reflect any asset for any sums deposited in court in
connection with the matter described on Schedule 3.02(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule (as defined below) or any subscription receivable in connection with
such matter, nor any liability or reserve in connection with such matter,
(iv) the Audited Closing Balance Sheet shall have accrued or reserved thereon
each of the items specified in this Agreement as being required to be accrued
or reserved on the Audited Closing Balance Sheet, in the respective amounts
specified herein and, further, all such accruals and reserves shall be
determined as if the Audited Closing Balance Sheet were a year-end balance
sheet of the Company, and (v) the warranty reserve used in the preparation of
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Audited Closing Balance Sheet in
each case shall be adjusted to reflect the reserve which would be required if
it were calculated in accordance with the Thor Warranty Reserve Formula
annexed hereto as Annex 2.04(c).  -------------  SECTION 2.05 Escrow. 
------   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Article II, on the Closing Date, there shall be deducted from the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Sections 2.01(b)(iii) and (iv), on a
pro rata basis, the sum of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the
"Escrowed Funds"),  -------------- which sum will be deposited into an
interest bearing escrow account, to be held by The Chase Manhattan Bank (the
"Escrow Agent") pursuant to an escrow agreement  ------------   10   to
be entered into on the Closing Date among Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Holders, the Holder Representatives and the Escrow Agent in
substantially the form annexed hereto as Exhibit 2.05(a) (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The  ---------------- ----------------- Escrowed Funds will be
deposited in accordance with the Cash/Stock Ratio (i.e., 55% of the Escrowed
Funds will be cash and 45% of the Escrowed Funds will be shares of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, together with
duly endorsed blank stock powers) valued based on the Common Stock Stated
Value or the Preferred Stock Stated Value, respectively, as indicated
in Section 2.01(a)(ii). In addition, any shares of Parent Common Stock or
Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, issued from time to time after
the Closing Date in respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent
Preferred Stock included in the Escrowed Funds by virtue of any stock split,
stock combination, stock dividend or reclassification of shares,
reorganization, recapitalization or similar change shall be immediately
deposited into the escrow account, together with duly endorsed blank stock
powers, and shall, upon deposit, be deemed to be part of the Escrowed Funds
for all purposes hereunder. The Escrowed Funds will secure (x) any
adjustments to the Merger Consideration as provided for in Section 2.04, and
(y) the Holders\' indemnification obligations under Articles IX and XI of
this Agreement. The Escrowed Funds will be withdrawn or released as
follows:   (i) upon the final determination of the Shareholder Equity  in
accordance with Section 2.04, (A) if Parent is entitled to  receive any
adjustment of the Merger Consideration, the amount  of such adjustment shall
be withdrawn from the Escrowed Funds in  accordance with Section 2.04, and
paid to Parent, within five  (5) days after such final determination, and (B)
there shall be  withdrawn from the Escrowed Funds the amounts necessary to
pay  any fees payable by the Holders to EandY; and the Independent Firm,  as
applicable, pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(v), such amounts to  be paid directly
to EandY; and the Independent Firm, as applicable;   (ii) following the final
determination of the Shareholder  Equity in accordance with Section 2.04 and
the withdrawal, if  any, of Escrowed Funds as provided in clause (i) above,
a  portion of the Escrowed Funds will be released to the Holders  (in
accordance with the Cash/Stock Ratio) such that the sum of  $15,000,000 (with
the value of the Parent Common Stock or the  Parent Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, to be based on the  Common Stock Stated Value or the Preferred
Stock Stated Value,  respectively) will remain as Escrowed Funds; provided,
however,  that if less than $15,000,000 (valued in the manner provided 
above) shall remain after the withdrawal as provided in clause  (i) above,
each Holder, within five (5) days after such  withdrawal, shall deposit such
additional cash and, at each  Holder\'s option, shares of Parent Common Stock
or Parent  Preferred Stock, as the case may be (valued in the manner 
provided above, but not to exceed forty-five percent (45%) of  the amount
required to be deposited) as needed to cause the  Escrowed Funds to be
$15,000,000 (such deposit to be made by the  Holders, pro rata, based on the
respective portion of the Merger  Consideration that each Holder is entitled
to receive under  Sections 2.01(b)(iii) and (iv)); and   11    (iii) the
remaining Escrowed Funds (including any  undistributed interest earned
thereon), if any, will be released  to the Holders on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing  Date; provided, however, that if prior to such
first (1st)  -------- -------  anniversary Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall give  notice of a claim or claims for indemnification
pursuant to  Articles IX or XI of this Agreement, then: (A) if any such
claim  is resolved prior to such first (1st) anniversary, by judicial 
determination or otherwise, any sums due Parent or the Surviving  Corporation
shall be withdrawn from the Escrowed Funds and paid  to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, within five (5) days  after such resolution; or (B) if
any such claim is not resolved  prior to such first (1st) anniversary, the
amount of such claim,  plus the reasonably estimated amount of legal fees
and  disbursements to be incurred in connection therewith, shall be 
retained as Escrowed Funds until such claim is resolved. Any  amounts to be
withdrawn or to be retained pursuant to clause (A)  or (B) above shall be
withdrawn or retained, respectively, as  follows: (x) if such claim is a
Third Party Claim (as defined in  Section 9.06(b)), first from Escrowed Funds
consisting of cash,  and thereafter from shares of Parent Common Stock or
Parent  Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and (y) if such claim is  not a
Third Party Claim, in accordance with the Cash/Stock Ratio  or, at the option
of the Holder Representatives, in cash. For  purposes of determining the
number of shares of Parent Common  Stock (if applicable) to be withdrawn or
to be retained as  Escrowed Funds under this clause (iii), the Parent Common
Stock  shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Common Stock Stated 
Value. For purposes of determining the number of shares of  Parent Preferred
Stock (if applicable) to be withdrawn or to be  retained as Escrowed Funds
under this clause (iii), the Parent  Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have
a value equal to the  Preferred Stock Stated Value.   Any Escrowed Funds
released to the Holders shall be paid to the Holders, pro rata, based on the
respective portion of the Merger Consideration that each Holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(iii) and (iv), it being agreed that no
Escrowed Funds shall be released to any Holder in respect of the Company
Redeemable Preferred Stock.   (b) In addition, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article II, on the Closing Date, there shall
be deducted from the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Sections
2.01(b)(iii) and (iv), on a pro rata  --- ---- basis, an additional sum, in
cash, in the amount (the "Additional Escrowed  ---------- -------- Funds")
specified in the letter agreement to be entered into on the Closing
Date ----- among Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Holders and the
Holder Representatives in substantially the form annexed hereto as Exhibit
2.05(b)(i)  ------------------- (the "Letter Agreement"). The Additional
Escrowed Funds will be deposited into  ----------------- an interest bearing
escrow account to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement
to be entered into on the Closing Date among Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Holders, the Holder Representatives and the Escrow Agent in
substantially the form annexed hereto as Exhibit 2.05(b)(ii) (the 
------------------- "Additional Escrow Agreement", and, together with the
Escrow Agreement,  ----------------------------- collectively, the "Escrow
Agreements"), and will be withdrawn or released in 
------------------ accordance with the terms of the Letter Agreement and the
Additional Escrow Agreement.    12    ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND

complete copies of  -------------------- each of the Company\'s Agreements
(including all amendments thereto) have been delivered to Parent and

and effect, is between the Company and the counterparty named on Schedule
3.09(a) hereto, has an expiration date as set forth on Schedule 
----------------- 3.09(a) hereto, has not been amended or modified except as
set forth on Schedule 3.09(a) hereto, and constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof. The
Company is not and, to the knowledge of the Company, no other party to any
Company Agreement is in default thereunder, nor does the Company have
knowledge of any fact or circumstance with respect to any Company Agreement
which upon notice or lapse of time could give rise to a default
thereunder.   17    (b) Attached hereto as Schedule 3.09(b) is a true and
complete list  ---------------- of all purchase orders (other than purchase
commitments for raw materials and supplies in the ordinary course of
business) ("Open Purchase Orders") to which  --------------------- the
Company is a party or by which the Company is bound which involve or
may involve the payment of more than $10,000 to any single vendor or
supplier. True and complete copies of all such Open Purchase Orders have been
delivered to Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary. The Company has performed all
obligations required to be performed by the Company to date under each Open
Purchase Order. The Company is not and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
other party to any Open Purchase Order is in default thereunder, nor does the
Company have knowledge of any fact or circumstance with respect to any Open
Purchase Order which upon notice or lapse of time could give rise to a
default thereunder.   (c) None of the parties to the Damon Purchase
Agreement (as defined below) have made any claims against any other party or
parties thereto for any breach thereunder, nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, is there any basis for any claim under (i) that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement dated as of April 28, 2000 (the "Damon Purchase
Agreement") by and among the Company, Damon 
-------------------------- Corporation, an Indiana corporation ("Damon"), and
Lindon Investments, Inc., an  ----- Indiana corporation, (ii) that certain
Non-Competition Agreement, dated April 28, 2000, by and between the Company
and Damon, restricting certain of the Company\'s activities (the "Company
Non-Compete"), or (iii) that certain  -------------------- Non-Competition
Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2000, by and between Damon and the Company,
restricting certain of Damon\'s activities (the "Damon  ----- Non-Compete").
The Company had performed, and has no further obligations
with ----------- respect to, the joint marketing efforts described in
Sections 7.5(a) and (b) of the Damon Purchase Agreement. The Company Non-
Compete terminated on April 28, 2001 in accordance with its terms, and the
Company has no further obligation or liabilities thereunder. The Damon
Purchase Agreement and the Damon Non-Compete are in full force and effect,
have not been amended or modified, and constitute the entire agreement
between the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof. To
the knowledge of the Company, neither party to the Damon Non-Compete has
breached the terms thereof or made any claim of breach with respect thereto,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is not any basis for any claim of
breach.  SECTION 3.10 Real Property.  -------------   (a) Schedule
3.10(a) hereto lists all real property interests owned  --------------- by
the Company (the "Owned Real Property") and any contract for the purchase or 
-------------------- sale of real property. The Company has good and
marketable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property, subject only to those
exceptions to title identified on Schedule 3.10(a) hereto. Each parcel of
Owned Real Property and all improvements, located thereon (i) complies in all
material respects with all covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting
such property, either recorded or of which the Company has knowledge, (ii) is
not presently occupied or used by any party other than its owner, (iii) is
not subject to any option to purchase or lease, right of first refusal to
purchase or lease, reversionary interest or other instrument or Lien, whether
recorded or unrecorded, which would prohibit or require the consent or waiver
of another party to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby or
any subsequent sale or lease of the property, and (iv) is not subject to any
mortgage, deed of trust or other Lien securing debt which will not be
entirely released and satisfied at the Closing. There are no taxes currently
levied against the Owned Real Property which are   18   due and payable
and have not been paid. No party has provided goods or services to or in
connection with the Owned Real Property which will result in any mechanic\'s,
materialmens\', supplier\'s, or other Lien as a result of the
wrongful failure to pay for the same prior to Closing. The Company has made
available to Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary accurate and complete copies
of all title insurance policies, surveys and other documents and records
relating to the Owned Real Property that such parties have requested to the
extent that such material was actually in the possession of the Company.  
(b) The real property leases listed on Schedule 3.10(b) hereto (the 
----------------- "Real Property Leases") constitute all leases, subleases or
licenses of real  --------------------- property (the "Leased Real
Property"), whether written or oral, to which the 
--------------------- Company is a party or is bound (including any leases
with respect to the Leased Real Property owned by one or more of the Holders
or any affiliates of the Holders). Schedule 3.10(b) identifies each Real
Property Lease by the premises covered thereby, the date of lease and all
amendments and supplements thereto, the name of the landlord thereunder, and
the term of the lease, including the expiration date thereof. True and
correct copies of each of the written Real Property Leases (including all
amendments thereto) have been delivered to Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary.
The Company has valid and enforceable leasehold interests in the Leased Real
Property, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens). Each Real
Property Lease affords the Company peaceful and undisturbed possession of the
Leased Real Property covered thereby, and there exists no event of default or
event, occurrence, condition or act (including the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) on the part of the Company, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, on the part of the lessor thereunder, which, with the giving of
notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any further event or condition,
would become a material default under such Real Property Lease, give rise to
a right in the lessor to terminate the Real Property Lease or change any of
the material terms thereof or render the lessee liable to incur
any expenditure under such Real Property Lease. In the event any such Real
Property Lease requires the lessee to exercise, on or before the date hereof,
an option to renew in order to continue the term thereof, the Company has
properly exercised such option to renew.   (c) The Owned Real Property and
the Leased Real Property (collectively, the "Real Property") are the only
real property necessary or  -------------- required in connection with the
operation of the Business as it is now being conducted. To the knowledge of
the Company, the Real Property and improvements thereon may lawfully be used
in connection with the Business. Except to the extent that such non-
compliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect, the Real Property and
improvements are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations
and ordinances of all Governmental Entities including, but not limited to,
zoning, building, health, safety and environmental laws; and the Company has
not received any notices of violations with respect thereto.  SECTION 3.11
Machinery and Equipment. All machinery, equipment and other 
------------------------- tangible assets of the Company, necessary and
utilized in the operation of the Business, are in good operating condition
and in a state of repair sufficient for the conduct of normal operations
without the necessity of any known capital expenditure in excess of $15,000.
The Company\'s assets and properties (including leased assets and properties,
if any) are adequate to enable the Company to conduct the Business as now
being conducted. The Company does not have any   19   commitment or plan
to make any capital expenditure in excess of $15,000 that has not been set
forth on Schedule 3.11 hereto.  -------------  SECTION 3.12 Inventories.
The inventories of the Company consist of raw  ----------- materials, work
in process, and finished goods of a quality and quantity usable or salable in
the normal course of the Business of the Company, except for any slow moving,
obsolete inventory or inventory of below-standard quality, all of which is
immaterial or has been written off or written down to realizable value or for
which there has been a reserve established pursuant to the
Financial Statements. The valuation at which the inventories of the Company
are carried reflects the normal inventory valuation policy of the Company
(applied in accordance with GAAP) which states inventory at the lower of
cost (first-in-first-out-method) or market and the Company\'s regular
costing standards with respect to work in process and finished goods
inventory.  SECTION 3.13 Accounts Receivable. The accounts receivable of the
Company  -------------------- result from and will result from bona fide
sales made by the Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and have been collected in the ordinary course after provision
for doubtful accounts and other reserves required by GAAP. The accounts
receivable of the Company that will be recorded on the Audited Closing
Balance Sheet will be collectible in the ordinary course after provision for
doubtful accounts and other reserves required by GAAP as set forth thereon
The amounts due, or to become due, in respect of such accounts receivable are
not, to the Company\'s knowledge, in dispute and there are no, and will not
be, any setoffs or counterclaims asserted against any of the accounts
receivable of the Company.  SECTION 3.14 Intellectual Property Rights.

pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, that pertains to or
challenges the right of the Company to use any of the Intellectual Property
Rights identified on Schedule 3.14 hereto (including any claim that the
Company must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property Rights
or other proprietary information of any other person). The Company has not
granted any license or other right and has no obligation to grant any license
or other right with respect thereto. To the knowledge of the Company, no
other person has infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated any
Intellectual Property Right of the Company. The Company has delivered to
Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary a true, complete and correct copy of all
correspondence involving any claim, demand or proceeding listed or referred
to on Schedule 3.14 hereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
to the knowledge of the Company, fully paid, enforceable licenses govern the
Company\'s use of software in which the Microsoft Corporation has  
20   Intellectual Property Rights, each of such licenses remains in full
force and effect, the Company has not breached any such license in any
material respect, and the Company has paid all amounts that have heretofore

this Agreement will not give rise to any Lien on such assets or properties.
With respect to leased Real Property, the Company holds, and on the Closing
Date will hold, a valid leasehold interest in and to the Real Property
Leases, in each case free and clear of all Liens whatsoever (except Permitted
Liens). There are not, and on the Closing Date there will not be, any

such taxes have been granted or are pending. There is no audit, examination,

contained in this Agreement shall be construed to require Parent (i) to
divest or commit to divest any assets or business of Parent, any subsidiary

this  ------------------ Agreement shall make or cause to be made any press
release or similar public announcement or communication in any form with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, without
the consent of the other parties, except if Parent, based on the advice of
its counsel, reasonably believes that such disclosure is required to comply

be, the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter, condition or
occurrence arising after the date hereof which, if existing or occurring as
of the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary shall have the right to refuse to waive any failure of
the Company, the Principal Shareholder or the Holders to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 6.01(b) as a result of any supplement or
amendment of the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Section 5.10. To the

satisfy the condition set forth as Section 6.01(b), any such supplement to or
amendment of the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any   38   matter,
condition or occurrence arising after the date hereof shall be considered
part of the Disclosure Schedule and, as such, Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary shall not make any claim for indemnification based on
such supplements or amendments pursuant to Article IX hereof. Any supplement
or amendment of the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter, condition
or occurrence existing or occurring as of the date of this Agreement that
should have been, but was not, set forth or described in the Disclosure
Schedule, shall not affect the rights of Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary
under Section 10.01(iii) or (iv) or Section 10.02 hereof.  SECTION 5.11 Tax
Matters.  -----------   (a) Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary, on the one

take any action (or to cause the Surviving Corporation, any affiliate of

may be, not to fail to take any action), which if taken or not taken, as the
case may be, (excluding in each case any action or failure to take any action
that is contemplated by this Agreement) could be reasonably anticipated to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to constitute a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, in the case that the
Merger is a Forward Merger.   (c) Parent, on behalf of itself and on behalf
of the Surviving Corporation, agrees to report any transaction that occurs on

legend:   THE CORPORATION WILL FURNISH TO ANY STOCKHOLDER UPON REQUEST AND 
WITHOUT CHARGE, A FULL STATEMENT OF THE DESIGNATIONS, RELATIVE  RIGHTS,
PREFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE SHARES OF EACH CLASS  AND EACH SERIES
THEREOF AUTHORIZED TO BE ISSUED BY THE  CORPORATION.  SECTION 8.04
Registration of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall use its 
--------------------------------------- reasonable best efforts to cause the

Disposition pursuant to the Stock Restriction Agreement, to be registered for
sale from time to time by the Holders on one or   47   more shelf

Agreement, in excess of the number of shares that may be sold by each such
Restricted Shareholder without registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, all as more fully described in the Registration
Rights Agreement. On the Closing Date, Parent and each Holder shall enter
into a registration rights agreement substantially in the form annexed hereto

-----------------------------   ARTICLE IX  SURVIVAL;
INDEMNIFICATION  SECTION 9.01 Survival Past Closing. Any investigation or
examination by  ---------------------- Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary of
the business, properties or affairs of the Company or the Holders shall not
affect the representations and warranties of the Company and the Holders
herein contained, and the respective representations and warranties of the
parties herein contained shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1)
year (referred to herein as "General Representations"), with 
------------------------ the exception of (i) representations and warranties
of the Company and the Principal Shareholder with respect to taxes, product
liability and product recall claims and environmental matters, as set forth
in Sections 3.18, 3.24 and 3.27, respectively (referred to herein as "Special
Representations"), which  ------------------------ shall survive the Closing
for the applicable statute of limitations, and (ii) representations and
warranties of each Holder as set forth in Article III.A hereof (referred to
herein as "Personal Representations"), which shall survive 
------------------------- indefinitely.  SECTION 9.02 Indemnification by
the Holders. The Holders shall indemnify, 
------------------------------- defend and hold Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates harmless from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, fines, penalties,
costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' and
accounting fees (collectively, "Losses") incurred by  ------ Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates, arising
out of or resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Company or the Holders contained in this Agreement or in any
schedule hereto, (ii) the nonperformance of any covenant or obligation to
be performed by the Company or the Holders under this Agreement, and/or (iii)
any of the matters described on Annex 9.02(iii) hereto (the "Additional
Matters");  -------------- ------------------- provided, however, that (x)
no Holder shall be required to indemnify for any -------- ------- Losses in
excess of the portion of the Merger Consideration received by such  
48   Holder, except for Losses arising out of or resulting from the breach
of such Holder\'s Personal Representations, which shall not be limited, (y)
no Holder shall be required to indemnify for any Losses arising out of or
resulting from the breach of any other Holder\'s Personal Representations,
and (z) Losses shall be reduced by any Tax Benefit resulting from or net
insurance proceeds (after deducting any costs of collection) received by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the claims giving rise
to indemnification hereunder. The obligations of the Holders pursuant to this
Article IX shall be joint and several, to the extent of the Escrowed Funds,
and otherwise shall be several among the Holders as provided in Section
9.05.   For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Benefit" shall mean (i) an
actual reduction in taxes payable, (ii) an actual refund of taxes previously
paid, or (iii) the present value of any future refund, future credit,
reduction in future taxes payable as a result of an increased net operating
loss or other future reduction in an otherwise required tax payment,
including in each such case any interest paid (or in the case of a future
refund, payable) thereon. The present value of the amounts described in
clause (iii) of the preceding sentence shall be computed (A) using the tax
rate applicable to the highest level of income with respect to such tax under
the applicable tax law on the date prescribed for payment of the indemnity
payment (taking into account, if applicable, the character of the income
which is reduced by the loss or similar item) and assuming sufficient income
in all applicable tax periods to use such benefit, and (B) using as a
discount rate the interest rate on such date imposed on corporate
deficiencies paid within thirty (30) days of a notice of proposed deficiency
under Section 6621(a) of the Code.  SECTION 9.03 Indemnification by Parent
and Acquisition Subsidiary. Parent and 
---------------------------------------------------- Acquisition Subsidiary
shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold the Holders and their
respective affiliates harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred
by any of the Holders or their affiliates arising out of or resulting from
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary contained in this Agreement, and/or (ii)
the nonperformance of any covenant or obligation to be performed by Parent
or Acquisition Subsidiary under this Agreement.  SECTION 9.04 Limitation on
Indemnification. Neither the Holders pursuant to 
------------------------------ Section 9.02 nor Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 9.03 shall be
obligated to indemnify the other against any Losses until Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation, on one hand, or the Holders, on the
other hand, have incurred aggregate Losses in excess of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) (the "Basket"), except that the Basket shall not be applicable
to claims for indemnification against the Holders for breaches of Special
Representations, Personal Representations or Additional Matters, in which
case Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to receive the full amount of their Losses. At such time as the
aggregate Losses (including Losses arising out of or resulting from Special
Representations, Personal Representations or Additional Matters) incurred by
Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation, on one hand, or
Losses incurred by the Holders, on the other hand, shall exceed the Basket,
such party shall be entitled to receive the full amount of its Losses (and
not only that portion which is in excess of the Basket).   49   SECTION
9.05 Exclusive Remedy. The withdrawal of Escrowed Funds (including 
----------------- any undistributed interest earned thereon), as provided in
Section 2.05(a)(iii), will be the exclusive source of satisfaction for
monetary Losses subject to indemnification by the Holders pursuant to this
Article IX, except for Losses arising out of or resulting from breaches of
Special Representations or Personal Representations. Subject to the
provisions of Section 9.02, (a) Losses arising out of or resulting from
breaches of Personal Representations may, in the sole discretion of Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary and Surviving Corporation, be satisfied from any
source including, but not limited to, the Escrowed Funds; (b) Losses arising
out of or resulting from breaches of Special Representations shall be paid,
first, from the Escrowed Funds and, thereafter, from any source, provided,
however, that the maximum amount of all monetary Losses subject to --------
------- indemnification by the Holders pursuant to this Article IX arising
out of or resulting from General Representations, Special Representations and
Additional Matters (but not Personal Representations) shall not exceed Twenty
Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (inclusive of the Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000) deposited as Escrowed Funds, after giving effect to any
withdrawal or release of Escrowed Funds pursuant to Sections 2.05(a)(i)); and
(c) any liability for Losses arising out of or resulting from breaches of
Special Representations or Additional Matters from sources other than
Escrowed Funds shall be several among the Holders, pro rata, based on the
respective portion of the Merger Consideration received by each such Holder
under Sections 2.01(b)(iii) and (iv). From and after the Closing Date, the
provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
monetary damages arising out of or resulting from the breach of any
representations or warranties made pursuant to Articles III, III.A or IV of
this Agreement, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Nothing
contained in this Article IX shall limit or affect the obligations of the
Holders pursuant to the Letter Agreement.  SECTION 9.06 Indemnification
Procedures.  --------------------------   (a) If Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation,  on one hand, or the Holders, on
the other hand, shall receive notice of any matter which such party, or any
of its officers, directors subsidiaries, employees, agents, subsidiaries or
affiliates (any of the foregoing, an "Indemnitee"), has determined has given,
or, with respect to any matters other  ---------- than a breach of a
representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.22, is reasonably likely to
result in, a right of indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee
shall promptly give the indemnifying party (the "Indemnitor") 
---------- written notice of such claim, stating the amount of the Losses, if
known, and method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity
and including documentary proof, if available, and containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises; provided, however, that failure to so
notify the Indemnitor shall not  -------- ------- relieve the Indemnitor
from any liability which it may have on account of the claim, except to the
extent the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced by such failure.   (b) If
an Indemnitee shall receive notice of any claim or proceeding initiated by a
third party which is or may be subject to indemnification (each, a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnitee shall promptly give the Indemnitor 
------------------ written notice of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that failure to so  -------- ------- notify the Indemnitor shall
not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability which it may have on account of
the Third Party Claim, except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been
prejudiced by such failure. In such event the Indemnitee shall permit the
Indemnitor, at its option, to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim by counsel of its own choice and at its own   50   expense. If,
however, the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify
the Indemnitee hereunder against all Losses that may result from such Third
Party Claim and the Indemnitee is reasonably satisfied that the
Indemnitor has sufficient funds available (whether Escrowed Funds or
otherwise) to pay any Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnitor shall be entitled, at its option, to assume and control the
defense of such claim by counsel of its own choice and at its own expense,
provided that the Indemnitor  -------- and its counsel shall proceed with
diligence and good faith with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any Third
Party Claim and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense
of such Indemnitor if: (i) the Indemnitor has failed to promptly assume the
defense and employ counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such Third Party
Claim (including any impleaded parties) include such Indemnitee and any
Indemnitor, and such Indemnitee shall have been advised by its counsel that
there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and such Indemnitee
with respect to such Third Party Claim or with respect to any legal defense
which may be available; provided, however, that the Indemnitor  --------
------- shall not in such event be responsible hereunder for the fees and
expenses of more than one firm of separate counsel in connection with any
claim or proceeding.   (c) In the event the Indemnitor exercises its right
to undertake the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the Indemnitor in such defense and make available to the
Indemnitor witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in its
possession or under its control relating thereto as are reasonably requested
by the Indemnitor. Similarly, in the event the Indemnitee is, directly or
indirectly, conducting the defense against any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitor shall cooperate with the Indemnitee in such defense and make
available to the Indemnitee witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as are
reasonably requested by the Indemnitee. No Third Party Claim may be settled
by the Indemnitor without the written consent of the Indemnitee, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however,
that the Indemnitor may settle such Third Party Claim without --------
------- the consent of the Indemnitee so long as the settlement (x) includes
an unconditional release of the Indemnitee, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from the third party claimant, (y)
does not impose any liabilities or obligations on the Indemnitee, and (z)
with respect to any non-monetary provision of any settlement of a claim in
which Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation is the
Indemnitee, does not impose conditions upon the Indemnitee which, in the
Indemnitee\'s good faith judgment, could have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations, assets, properties or prospects of the Indemnitee.
No Third Party Claim which is being defended in good faith by the Indemnitee
alone, or jointly with the Indemnitor, shall be settled by the Indemnitee
without the written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided,  -------- however, that the Indemnitee may
settle such claim without the consent of the ------- Indemnitor so long as
the settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnitor, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor, from the claim
by the Indemnitee and the third party claimant and (y) does not impose any
liabilities or obligations on the Indemnitor.   51    ARTICLE X

Agreement may be terminated, and the  --------------------- transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing
Date:   (i) by the mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of the 
Company, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary;   (ii) by either Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary, if the  Company or any of the Holders breaches any of
their respective  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained  in this Agreement;   (iii) by the Company, if Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary  breaches any of their respective representations,
warranties,  covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;   (iv) by
either Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary, on the one  hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, if any of the  conditions to such party\'s obligations to
close the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement is not satisfied (or
waived in  writing by such party) on or prior to November 30, 2001 (the 
"Outside Date"); provided, however, that if any of such  -------------
-------- -------  conditions is not satisfied as a result of the breach by
any  party of its representations, warranties, covenants or  agreements
contained in this Agreement, then the party  responsible for such breach
shall not have the right to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause
(iv);   (v) by either Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary, on the one  hand,
or the Company, on the other hand, if the Closing has not  occurred on or
prior to the Outside Date; provided, however,  -------- -------  that if the
Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Outside  Date as a result of the
breach by any party of its  representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained  in this Agreement, then the party responsible for such
breach  shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
this clause (v); or   (vi) by either Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary, on
the one  hand, or the Company, on the other hand, if any of the following 
shall occur: (i) any suspension or limitation of trading in  securities
generally on the New York Stock Exchange lasting for  more than twenty-four
(24) hours, (ii) any banking moratorium  declared by U.S. Federal or New York
authorities, or (iii) any  outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in
which the United  States is involved or any other substantial national or 
international calamity or emergency.  SECTION 10.02 Effect of Termination.
In the event that either party shall  ---------------------- elect to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to any provision contained herein expressly
giving such party the right to terminate this Agreement, this Agreement shall
forthwith terminate and have no further effect, and neither party shall have
any further obligation or liability (except with respect to   52   those
provisions hereof which expressly survive any termination of this Agreement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
any provision hereof shall not relieve any party of any liability for a
breach of any representation or warranty, or nonperformance of any covenant
or obligation hereunder, and any such termination shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of any available remedy for any such breach or nonperformance.  
ARTICLE XI  FINDER\'S FEES   The Company and the Holders, on the one hand,
and Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary, on the other hand, represent and
warrant to each other that they respectively have had no dealings with any
finder, broker, financial advisor or investment banker in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than Barrington Associates
("Barrington"), which has been  ---------- engaged pursuant to separate
agreement by the Company and the Holders and whose compensation will be paid
in accordance with Section 13.01(b) hereof. The Holders will indemnify and
hold Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary harmless from and against any and all
liabilities (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys\' fees) to
which either may be subjected by reason of (i) any compensation or amounts
due or to become due to Barrington (including any Losses relating to or
arising out of that certain engagement letter dated July 26, 2001 between
Barrington and the Company or that certain termination agreement of even date
herewith between Barrington and the Company), or (ii) any other
finder\'s, broker\'s, financial advisor\'s, investment banker\'s or similar
fee or commission with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the extent such fee is attributable to any action undertaken by
the Holders or the Company; provided, however, any liabilities arising out of
or resulting from the -------- ------- foregoing may, in the sole discretion
of Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation, be satisfied
from any source including, but not limited to, the Escrowed Funds; and
provided, further, that the liability of the Holders  -------- ------- for
such liabilities from the Escrowed Funds shall be joint and several,
and otherwise shall be several among the Holders, pro rata, based on the
respective  --- ---- portion of Merger Consideration received by each such
Holder under Sections 2.01(b)(iii) and (iv). Parent and Acquisition
Subsidiary will jointly and severally indemnify and hold the Holders harmless
from and against any and all liabilities (including but not limited to
reasonable attorneys\' fees) to which any of them may be subjected by reason
of any finder\'s, broker\'s, financial advisor\'s, investment banker\'s or
similar fee or commission with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent such fee is attributable to any action
undertaken by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary. The provisions of this
Article XI shall survive any termination of this Agreement.   ARTICLE XII

MISCELLANEOUS  SECTION 13.01 Expenses.  --------   (a) Irrespective of

herein, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall pay all costs and expenses
that they incur, and the Holders shall pay all costs and expenses that the
Company or the Holders incur, including, but not limited to, legal,
accounting, financial advisory and investment banking fees and expenses, with
respect to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and any
other documents or instruments to be executed and delivered pursuant hereto,
and the performance of any covenants to be performed by such party and
satisfaction of any conditions to be satisfied by such party which are
contained herein or therein. The provisions of this Section 13.01 shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.   (b) Notwithstanding Section
13.01(a), upon the Closing, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall pay, on
behalf of the Company and the Holders, (i) all fees and expenses incurred by
the Company and the Holders described in Section 13.01(a) above, directly to
the Company\'s and Holder\'s counsel, investment banker and accountants as

to Parent no later than two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, and
(ii) any fees payable on or before the Closing Date by the Holders to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the Additional Escrow

------------------------   (c) In the event that any costs or expenses of
the Company or the Holders are not paid by the Holders pursuant to Section
13.01(a) or by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary pursuant to Section 13.01(b)
and, instead, are payable by the Company (or the Surviving Corporation)
following the Closing, such costs and expenses shall be accrued and reserved
on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Audited Closing Balance Sheet
for purposes of Section 2.04.  SECTION 13.02 Entire Agreement. This
Agreement, together with the Exhibits and  ---------------- Schedules
annexed hereto, and the documents and instruments to be executed
and delivered pursuant hereto, constitutes the entire understanding and
agreement by and among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements and understandings

Agreement may be waived (either   56   generally or in a particular
instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only by an instrument in
writing and signed by the party against whom such amendment or waiver is
sought to be enforced; provided, however, that  -------- ------- any such
amendment or waiver signed by the Holder Representatives shall be binding on
all of the Holders as provided in Section 13.15. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver
of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party
hereto, to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by any party hereto, preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or remedy.    SECTION 13.04 Successors and Assigns. Acquisition Subsidiary
shall have the  ---------------------- right to assign this Agreement and
its rights and obligations hereunder to any wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, neither this Agreement
nor any rights hereunder may be assigned by any party without the prior
written consent of the other parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.  SECTION 13.05 Governing Law. This
Agreement, including the validity hereof and  ------------- the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder, and all amendments and supplements
hereof and all waivers and consents hereunder, shall be construed
in accordance with and governed by the domestic substantive laws of the State
of New York without giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts of
law provision or rule that would cause the application of the domestic
substantive laws of any other jurisdiction.  SECTION 13.06 Severability. If
any provisions of this Agreement as applied to  ------------ any part or to
any circumstance shall be adjudged by a court to be invalid or unenforceable,
the same shall in no way affect any other provision of this Agreement, the
application of such provision in any other circumstances or the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement.  SECTION 13.07 No Third-Party
Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express 
---------------------------- or implied, shall create or confer on any person
other than the parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns,
any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities, except as expressly
provided in Article IX hereof.  SECTION 13.08 Attorneys\' Fees. If any
action at law or in equity is necessary  ---------------- to enforce or
interpret the terms of this Agreement or any other document or instrument to
be executed or delivered pursuant hereto, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and disbursements in addition
to any other relief to which such party may be entitled.  SECTION 13.09
Remedies. In case any one or more of the covenants and/or 
-------- agreements set forth in this Agreement shall have been breached by
any party hereto, the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such
covenants or agreements may, except as may otherwise be expressly provided in
this Agreement, proceed to protect and enforce their rights either by suit in
equity and/or by action at law, including, but not limited to, an action for
damages as a result   57   of any such breach and/or an action for
specific performance of any such covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement. The rights, powers and remedies of the parties under this
Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or
remedy which such parties may have under any other agreement or law. No
single or partial assertion or exercise of any right, power or remedy of a
party hereunder shall preclude any other or further assertion or exercise
thereof. From and after the Closing Date, the provisions contained in Article
IX herein shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages arising
out of or resulting from the breach of any representations or warranties made
pursuant to Articles III, III.A or IV of this Agreement, absent fraud
or intentional misrepresentation.  SECTION 13.10 Consent to Jurisdiction
and Service of Process. Each Holder, for 
---------------------------------------------- itself, its personal
representatives, legatees, heirs and assigns, hereby consents to the personal
jurisdiction of the courts of the County and State of New York and of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, each as
may have competent jurisdiction, with respect to any dispute or controversy
arising under or in connection with this Agreement and agrees that process
issued out of any such court or in accordance with the rules of practice of
such court may be served by mail or other form of substituted service to the
Holder Representatives, as provided by Section 13.15(a), at the addresses and
with copies as provided in Article XII and that any actions therein may be

entitled and authorized to give notices only to the Holder Representatives in
lieu of any notice contemplated by this Agreement to be given to any
Holder.   (e) The appointment and designation of the Holder
Representatives pursuant to this Section 13.15 shall be irrevocable except in
the event of (i) the termination or resignation from the Summit Holders by,
or the death or physical or mental incapacity of, Joseph F. Trustey, in which
event the Summit Holders shall promptly (x) designate his successor and (y)
deliver written notice to the other parties hereto of such designation, or
(ii) the death or physical or mental incapacity of H. Coleman Davis III, in
which event the Holders (other than the Summit Holders) who have received a
majority of the Merger Consideration delivered hereunder (including the
Escrowed Funds) shall promptly (x) designate his successor and (y) deliver
written notice to the other parties hereto of such designation; provided,
however, that in the event that a  -------- ------- successor is not
appointed and designated pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) within fifteen (15)
days after the event giving rise to the need to designate a  
59   successor (or any shorter time as required to permit Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to give any notice or preserve, enforce or exercise any
rights or remedies under this Agreement that must be given, preserved,
enforced or exercised within such shorter time period), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation may, in their sole discretion, elect to treat the other
of the Holder Representatives, notwithstanding the joint appointment and
designation set forth in Section 13.15(a), as the sole Holder Representative
for such purpose, and if, at any time, no Holder Representative is properly

their sole discretion, elect to treat any Holder as the sole Holder
Representative for such purpose.  SECTION 13.16 Knowledge. As used in this

Holders, (ii) Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary, the actual knowledge of its
Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and (iii) each Holder,
the actual knowledge of such Holder, in each case after due and reasonable
inquiry, which, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, shall consist of
due and reasonable inquiry of those officers and Holders of the Company or of
those officers of Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary, as the case may be, who
would normally be expected to have knowledge of the truth or completeness of
the representation or warranty in question.  SECTION 13.17 Material Adverse
Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term 
------------------------ "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to the
Company, any breach of a  ------------------------ representation or
warranty hereunder or a covenant to be performed by the Company or the
Holders the effect of which may be to (x) impede or impair the operation of
the Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice or (y)
cause the Company (or the Surviving Corporation) to pay or become liable to
pay more than $10,000 to remedy any single such event, violation,
breach, default or termination (as the case may be) or more than $25,000 in
the aggregate for all such events, violations, breaches, or defaults or
terminations (as the case may be).  SECTION 13.18 Company Director and
Officer Indemnification. From and after the 
-------------------------------------------- Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each director
and officer of the Company who are signatories to this Agreement against any
liability and reasonable expense incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether

3.21 hereto), at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent ------------- that the Company would have been permitted under
Indiana law and the Company\'s Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-laws
in effect on the date hereof to indemnify any such person; provided, however,
that no such person shall be  -------- ------- entitled to such
indemnification in connection with any such claim, action, suit, proceeding

(and, by their signature below, each director or officer of the Company
executing this Agreement hereby acknowledges that he shall not be entitled to
