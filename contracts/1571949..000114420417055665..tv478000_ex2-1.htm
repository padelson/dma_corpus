deduction is required, Purchasers shall use reasonable efforts to
provide notice to Seller at least ten (10) Business Days prior to withholding
any amount pursuant to this _Section 3.8_, and the Parties shall use
reasonable efforts to reduce or avoid such withholding where possible. To the
extent that any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will

necessary for Purchasers to obtain authorization to make payments under this
Agreement without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Tax.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any compensatory
amounts subject to payroll reporting and withholding payable pursuant to or

claim, investigation or lawsuit under any employment Law or against the
Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties

Foreign Company Benefit Plan; (iii) each Foreign Company Benefit Plan
required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in

relates to the Trayport Companies prior to the Closing, for five (5) years
after the Closing Date, or for any longer period as may be (i) required by
any Governmental Authority or (ii) reasonably necessary with respect to the
prosecution or defense of any legal action that is then pending or threatened
or audit and with respect to which the requesting Party has notified the
other Party as to the need to retain such books, records or information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(b)_, the
provisions of _Article VIII_ shall govern the preservation, retention and
sharing of Tax Returns and Tax work papers. After the Closing Date,
Purchasers, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates, including in the case of Purchasers, the Trayport
Companies, to permit the other Party, its Affiliates and their representatives
to have reasonable access to, and to inspect and copy, all materials referred
to in this _Section 6.3(b)_ and to meet with officers and employees of such
other Parties on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to
obtain explanations with respect to such materials and to obtain additional
information in connection with the preparation of any financial statements or
Tax Returns of such other Party or its Affiliates. Purchasers acknowledge and
agree that Seller and its Affiliates have limited information due to the
constraints imposed on Seller and its Affiliates by the CMA Orders and that
Seller and its Affiliates shall only be required to preserve, or provide
access to, such materials referred to in this _Section 6.3(b)_ as it was
permitted to receive under the CMA Orders and any derogations therefrom
granted by the CMA.

(c) _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(i) All information provided or obtained in connection with the Sale
will be held by Purchasers in accordance with the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated June 26, 2017, between TMX Group Limited and Guarantor (the
" _Non-Disclosure Agreement_ "). In the event of a conflict or inconsistency
between the terms of this Agreement and the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the
terms of this Agreement will govern. Seller hereby assigns in part, effective
as of Closing, to Purchasers or the Trayport Companies, as specified by
Purchasers, the rights that Seller or its Affiliates may have under any other
confidentiality agreements entered into with respect to any
potential alternative transaction similar to the Sale, to the extent
assignment is permitted thereby only to the extent that such rights relate to
(i) the confidentiality obligations of the counterparty to such agreements
with respect to the Trayport Companies and/or (ii) the non-solicitation
and/or non-hire obligations of the counterparty to such agreements with
respect to the Trayport Companies.

  



  

(ii) Seller acknowledges that the success of the Trayport Companies
and the Business after the Closing depends upon the continued preservation of
the confidentiality of certain information possessed by such Persons and their
Affiliates, that the preservation of the confidentiality of such information
by such Persons and their Affiliates is an essential premise of the bargain
between Seller and Purchasers, and that Purchasers would be unwilling to
enter into this Agreement in the absence of this _Section 6.3(c)(ii)_.
Accordingly, Seller shall not, and shall procure that its representatives,
Affiliates and Affiliates' representatives will not, directly or indirectly,
without the prior written consent of Purchasers, disclose to a third party,
any information involving or relating to the Business or any Trayport
Company; _provided_ , that the information subject to this _Section
6.3(c)(ii)_ will not include any information that (A) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure in violation
hereof; (B) is or becomes available to such Person on a non-confidential basis
from a source so long as such Person does not know or have reason to believe
that the source was prohibited by a contractual, legal, or fiduciary
obligation to any Trayport Company from disclosing such information; (C) is
independently developed, conceived, or discovered by such Person; _provided_
, _further_ , that the provisions of this _Section 6.3(c)(ii)_ will not
prohibit any retention of copies of records or disclosure (I) required by any
applicable Law so long as prior notice, when reasonably practicable, is given
to Purchasers of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded
Purchasers to contest the same at Purchasers' sole cost and expense (it being
agreed that the disclosure of financial or other information regarding the
Trayport Companies as required by Seller and its Affiliates' public reporting
obligations, shall not require any prior notice or right of Purchasers to
contest); _provided_ that if, in the absence of a protective order, Seller and
its Affiliates and their Affiliate's representatives, as applicable, is, in
the opinion of counsel (which may be internal counsel), compelled as a matter
of law to disclose such information, such Person may disclose only that part
of the information as required to be disclosed, (II) made in connection with
the defense of any claim or enforcement of any right or remedy relating to
this Agreement or the Sale, or (III) if requested by any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over such Person or (D) relates to Seller's or
any of its Affiliates' status as a customer of the Business or becomes
available to Seller or any of its Affiliates in such person's capacity as a
customer of the Business.

Section 6.4 _Efforts; Filings_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Seller and Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to take,
agree to take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, any and all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise so as to consummate the Sale, and each shall, and
shall cause its respective Affiliates to, cooperate fully to that end.
Subject to _Section 6.3_ and the Non-Disclosure Agreement, and to the extent
not prohibited by Law or the applicable Governmental Authority, each Party
shall (i) permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with, any
proposed written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any
Governmental Authority (excluding, in the case of communication by Seller and
its Affiliates, the CMA to the extent that such communications are not
directly in relation to any of this Agreement, the NGX Agreement or Purchasers
or their Affiliates) regarding the Sale and (ii) promptly inform the other
Parties (and if in writing, provide the other Parties or their counsel with
copies) of all correspondence, filings and communications between the Party
and any Governmental Authority (excluding, in the case of communication by
Seller and its Affiliates, the CMA to the extent that such communications are
not directly in relation to any of this Agreement, the NGX Agreement or
Purchasers or their Affiliates) regarding the Sale. The Parties may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other Parties under this _Section 6.4_ as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Purchasers or Seller, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.4_ may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Trayport Companies, (B) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, or (C) as necessary to address reasonable legal
privilege concerns.

  



  

(b) No Party shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement (or make oral submissions at
meetings or in telephone or other conversations) unless it consults with the
other Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that: (i) only Purchasers and
their representatives shall attend and participate in Purchasers' initial
communications with, and all telephone calls from, Canadian securities
regulators in connection with the sale of the NGX/Shorcan Equity
Interests pursuant to the NGX Agreement and (ii) this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall
not apply to meetings or telephone or other conversations which Seller or its
Affiliates alone may have with the CMA in relation to the CMA Orders unless
such meeting or telephone or other conversation is directly in relation to
any of this Agreement, the NGX Agreement or Purchasers or their Affiliates. If
Seller or its Affiliates has any material substantive discussions with the
CMA regarding any of this Agreement, the NGX Agreement or Purchasers or their
Affiliates, Seller shall promptly inform Purchasers of such discussions and
the nature and substance thereof (to the extent permitted by the CMA and
applicable Law).

  



  

   

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Each of Seller and Purchasers agree to, and to cause their
respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts
to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all
permits, consents, clearances, approvals and authorizations of all
Governmental Authorities and other Persons necessary to consummate the Sale
(or permit the Business to be operated in the same manner following the Sale)
as promptly as practicable, in particular, each Party shall, and shall procure
that its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the Trayport Companies) will,
as promptly as practicable, provide the other Parties all such assistance and
information as may reasonably be required. If either or both of the Parties
receive any request for information or documentary materials from any
Governmental Authority (including in relation to the Trayport Companies'
compliance with the CMA Orders), each of the Parties will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to respond to and provide reasonably
required information in respect of such request to such Governmental
Authority as promptly as possible and counsel for the Parties will reasonably
cooperate during the entirety of any such process.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Acquisition Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter and, prior to the
Closing, shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto, if such amendment, modification or
waiver (A) reduces the aggregate amount of the Acquisition Financing, or (B)
imposes new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Acquisition Financing or other terms in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (x) make, in any material respect, the timely funding of the
Acquisition Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Acquisition Financing less likely to occur or (y) adversely impact, in any
material respect, the ability of Purchasers to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Commitment Letter or to draw upon and consummate the
Acquisition Financing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers may amend,
replace or otherwise modify the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement
with respect thereto to add arrangers, bookrunners, agents, lenders or similar
entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement or to reassign titles to such parties who had executed the
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , in each
case, such amendment, replacement or modification does not, without the
prior written consent of Seller: (i) make, in any material respect, the
timely funding of the Acquisition Financing or satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Acquisition Financing less likely to occur or (ii) adversely
impact, in any material respect, the ability of Purchasers to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or to draw upon and
consummate the Acquisition Financing.

  



  

   

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
subject to _Section 6.5(c)_, maintain in effect and satisfy on a
timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letter within Purchasers' reasonable control in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, (iii)
satisfy all conditions to such definitive agreements that are applicable to
Purchasers that are within Purchasers' control, (iv) if the NGX Sale is not
consummated in accordance with the NGX Agreement prior to or contemporaneously
with the Closing, draw upon and consummate the Acquisition Financing at or
prior to the Closing and (v) if the NGX Sale is not consummated in accordance
with the NGX Agreement prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing, fully
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter to draw upon and
consummate the Acquisition Financing, subject to the terms and conditions of
the Commitment Letter. Purchasers shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity
concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the Acquisition Financing.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Acquisition Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or the
Commitment Letter becomes terminated or modified in a manner materially
adverse to Purchasers for any reason, Purchasers shall use their reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources with conditions to obtaining such alternative financing no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchasers than those contained in the
Commitment Letter and in an amount at least equal to the Acquisition
Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the "
_Alternate Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with
respect to such Alternate Financing (the " _New Commitment Letter_ ") which
shall replace the existing Commitment Letter, a copy of which shall be
promptly provided to Seller. In the event any New Commitment Letter is
obtained, any reference in this Agreement to the "Acquisition Financing"
shall mean the financing contemplated by the New Commitment Letter.

  



  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the availability of nor the
funding of the Acquisition Financing shall be a condition to the
obligation of Purchasers to consummate the Sale.

  



  

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing
Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, subject in all respects to the CMA Orders, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
such assistance and cooperation (and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its and their respective representatives to provide such assistance and
cooperation) with respect to any Acquisition Financing as is reasonably
requested by Purchasers, including using commercially reasonable efforts with
respect to: (i) cooperating reasonably with each Lender's due diligence; and
(ii) providing financial information relating only to the Business or the
Trayport Companies as may reasonably be requested by a Purchaser; _provided_
that nothing in this _Section 6.5(e)_ shall require Seller, any of its
Subsidiaries (including any Trayport Company) or any of its or their
respective representatives to prepare any new financial statements or
projections that are not prepared in the ordinary course of business and past
practice of the Business. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth
herein or in any other agreement between Seller and a Purchaser (or its
Affiliates), Seller agrees that Purchasers and their Affiliates may share
customary projections with respect to the Business or the Trayport Companies
with the Lenders identified in the Commitment Letters and to any existing
lenders of Purchasers, and that Purchasers, their Affiliates and such Lenders
may share such information with potential Lenders in connection with any
marketing efforts in connection with the Acquisition Financing, provided that
the recipients of such information are subject to customary confidentiality
arrangements between Purchasers and such parties (which need not include
Seller). None of Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
respective directors or officers or other personnel or representatives shall
be required by this _Section 6.5(e)_ to take any action or provide any
assistance that unreasonably interferes with the ongoing operations of Seller
and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

   

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Purchasers shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives from and against any
and all losses, damages, claims and out-of-pocket costs or expenses, actually
suffered or incurred by them in connection with any Acquisition Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this _Section 6.5_ ) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than untrue information
provided by Seller or its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives in
writing for use in the Acquisition Financing documents), in any case, except
to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the gross
negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or intentional breach by or of Seller
or its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives. In
addition, Purchasers shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or
its Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of Seller's obligations
under this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

Section 6.6 _No Solicitation_. Except as provided by Law, during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall
directly or indirectly solicit any person who was an employee or
subcontractor of any of the Trayport Companies or the Business on the date
hereof or the Closing Date (a " _Restricted Person_ ") to terminate his or
her employment with, or otherwise cease his or her relationship with, any of
the Trayport Companies or the Business or to become an employee of Seller or
any of its Affiliates; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall
prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from (A) engaging in general
solicitations to the public or general advertising not targeted at any
Restricted Person, (B) soliciting any Restricted Person whose employment or
engagement has been terminated by any Trayport Company following the Closing
other than as a response to any inducement or encouragement by the Seller or
any of its Affiliates or (C) soliciting any Restricted Person whose
employment or engagement with any Trayport Company has been terminated by the
Restricted Person following the Closing other than as a response to any
inducement or encouragement by the Seller or any of its Affiliates (but only
after at least ninety (90) days have passed since the date of termination of
employment or engagement).

  



  

Section 6.7 _Further Assurances_. After the Closing Date, each of
Seller and Purchasers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts from
time to time to do, make, execute and deliver, or cause to be done, made,
executed and delivered, at the reasonable request of the other Party, such
further acts, assurances, additional documents and instruments (including any
assignments, bills of sale, assumption agreements, consents and other similar
instruments in addition to those required by this Agreement) as may be
reasonably required to give effect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to provide whatever documents or other evidence of
ownership as may be reasonably requested by Purchasers to confirm Purchasers'
ownership of the Trayport Companies.

Section 6.8 _Intercompany Agreements; Intercompany Accounts_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.8_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter or as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Related
Agreements, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, immediately prior
to the Closing, execute and deliver such releases, termination agreements and
discharges (in forms reasonably acceptable to Purchasers) as are necessary to
release and discharge each Trayport Company from any and all Liabilities owed
to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any Trayport Company). In
addition, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, immediately prior
to the Closing, execute and deliver such releases, termination agreements and
discharges (in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchasers) as are necessary to
(i) release and discharge Seller and each of its Affiliates (other than the
Trayport Companies) from any and all obligations owed to any Trayport Company
and (ii) terminate all arrangements, commitments, contracts and understandings
among Seller and any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Trayport
Company, on the other hand, in each case other than those set forth on
_Section 6.8_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter or as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement or the Related Agreements.

  



  

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, all intercompany accounts
between Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any
Trayport Company), on the one hand, and any Trayport Company, on the other
hand, shall be settled or otherwise eliminated (other than
intercompany accounts that arise out of services performed pursuant to
Contracts identified in _Section 4.15(a)(xiv)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, which shall remain outstanding in accordance with their terms).
Intercompany accounts between and among the Trayport Companies shall not be
affected by this provision.

  



  

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) For the one year period following the Closing Date, Purchasers
will provide, or cause one of their Affiliates to provide, each
Business Employee who is employed as of the Closing (each a " _Continuing
Employee_ "), for so long as he/she remains employed with Purchasers or one
of their Affiliates (including any Trayport Company) during such one year
period, with (A) base salary at least equal to the base salary provided to
the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing and (B) benefits
(other than equity compensation or defined benefit pension benefits) that,
taken as a whole, are comparable in the aggregate to those provided to
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing. For the 2017 fiscal
year, Purchasers will provide, or cause one of their Affiliates to provide,
on aggregate, a bonus pool that is comparable to, and distributed in a
comparable discretionary manner as, the aggregate bonus pool for the Trayport
Companies for the 2016 fiscal year.

  



  

   

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of
benefits, Purchasers shall recognize the service of each Continuing
Employee with any Trayport Company before the Closing Date as if such service
had been performed with Purchasers or their Affiliates (i) for all purposes
under the Company Benefit Plans maintained by Purchasers or their Affiliates
after the Closing Date (to the extent such plans, programs, or agreements are
delivered to Continuing Employees), (ii) for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under any employee benefit plans and programs of Purchasers or their
Affiliates other than the Company Benefit Plans (the " _New Benefit Plans_ ")
in which the Continuing Employee participates after the Closing Date, and
(iii) for benefit accrual purposes under any New Benefit Plan that is a
vacation or severance plan in which the Continuing Employee participates after
the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) With respect to any welfare plan (or their equivalent outside
the United States) maintained by Purchasers or their Affiliates in
which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing,
Purchasers and their Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did
not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the
Trayport Companies prior to the Closing and (ii) to the extent applicable
under any such plan, provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_ to the contrary,
nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or any employee
benefit plan of Purchasers or their Affiliates, or shall limit the right of
Purchasers or their Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any
such Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Purchasers or their
Affiliates following the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions
of such plans. If (i) a party other than the Parties makes a claim or takes
other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to
any such plan, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such
plan even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then,
solely with respect to such plan, such provision shall lapse retroactively and
shall have no amendatory effect with respect thereto. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.9_ are included
for the sole benefit of the Parties, and that nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights (A) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any Continuing
Employee, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit
plan of Purchasers or their Affiliates, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Purchasers or any of
their Affiliates.

Section 6.10 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing,
Purchasers shall cause the Trayport Companies to indemnify and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors and officers of any Trayport Company as of the date hereof (and as
of the date of the 2015 Signing and the 2015 Closing) and anyone who becomes a
director or officer of any Trayport Company during the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Closing (in such capacities) (the " _D andO
Indemnified Persons_") for all acts and omissions occurring at or prior to
the Closing to the same extent such DandO Indemnified Persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by the Trayport Companies pursuant to the
organizational documents of any applicable Trayport Company as in existence
on the date hereof, in each case, to the fullest extent that
such indemnification and advancement is permitted by applicable Law.
Purchasers shall cause the organizational documents of the Trayport Companies
to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitation of director and officer liability that are no less favorable
to the DandO Indemnified Persons with respect to acts or omission occurring at
or prior to the Closing than those set forth in the organizational documents
of the Trayport Companies as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions
thereafter shall, subject to applicable Law, not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Persons for a period of six (6) years from
and after the Closing. From and after the Closing, Purchasers shall cause the
Trayport Companies to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each
of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

(b) If Purchasers, the Trayport Companies or any of their or their
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Purchasers or the Trayport Companies, as the case may be, shall assume all
of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

(c) The obligations of Purchasers, the Trayport Companies and any
successors thereto under this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Person to
whom this _Section 6.10_ applies without the consent of such affected DandO
Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified
Persons to whom this _Section 6.10_ applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_).

  



  

Section 6.11 _Guarantees; Commitments_. Purchasers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to substitute itself or have one of its
Affiliates to be substituted for Seller and any of its Affiliates, and for
Seller and any of its Affiliates to be released, effective as of the Closing,
in respect of all obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates under each
of the agreements set forth on _Section 6.11_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (the " _London Lease Agreements_ "). If, as of the Closing, Purchasers
or one of their Affiliates shall not have substituted itself for Seller and
any of its Affiliates under, and caused Seller and its Affiliates to be
released from, any London Lease Agreement, (i) Purchasers shall continue to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause itself or one of its Affiliates
to be substituted for Seller and any of its Affiliates, and for Sellers and
any of its Affiliates to be released, in respect of all obligations of Seller
and any of its Affiliates under each London Lease Agreement and (ii)
Purchasers shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
against any Damages that Seller or any of its Affiliates suffer, incur or are
liable for by reason of or arising out of or in consequence of the London
Lease Agreements.

Section 6.12 _Preservation of Privilege_. Recognizing that Shearman
and Sterling LLP (" _Shearman_ ") has acted as legal counsel to Seller and its
Affiliates (including the Trayport Companies) in connection with the
negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Sale (the " _Pre-Closing Representation_ "), and that Shearman intends to
or may continue to act as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates after
the Closing (which Affiliates shall not include the Trayport Companies after
the Closing), the Parties hereby agree that after the Closing any attorney-
client privilege attaching to communications between Seller, Seller's
Affiliates or the Trayport Companies, on the one hand, and Shearman, on the
other hand, to the extent such communications relate to the Pre-Closing
Representation, shall belong to and be controlled by Seller, and following the
Closing, none of Purchasers nor their Affiliates (which Affiliates shall
include the Trayport Companies after the Closing) shall knowingly access any
such privileged communications.

  



  

Section 6.13 _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of (i) the Closing and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, and Seller shall procure that
its representatives, Affiliates (including the Trayport Companies) and
Affiliates' representatives will not, directly or indirectly: (A) solicit,
initiate, or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any
Person relating to, or enter into or consummate any transaction relating to,
the acquisition of any Securities in the Trayport Companies or any merger,
recapitalization, share exchange, sale of all or substantially all of the
Trayport Companies' assets (other than sales of inventory in the Ordinary
Course) or any similar transaction or any other alternative to the Sale or
(B) participate in any substantive discussions or negotiations regarding,
furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or
facilitate in any other manner, any effort or attempt by any Person to do or
seek any of the foregoing. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their Affiliates' representatives to, immediately discontinue any
conduct that would if continued after the date hereof violate any aspect of
the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

Section 6.14 _U.K. Equity Interests_. Effective as of and
conditioned upon the Closing, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein,
Seller hereby waives, and agrees not to exercise or assert, (a) any and all
rights such Seller has attached or accruing to the U.K. Equity Interests,
including the right to receive all dividends, distributions or any return of
capital declared, paid or made by Trayport Holdings Limited on or after the
Closing, and (b) any and all rights of pre-emption over any of the U.K. Equity
Interests conferred upon it by the articles of association of Trayport
Holdings Limited.

  



  

Section 6.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the date of

extent that the other Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a
copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Taxing
Authority.

  



  

(b) Seller shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any
audit, examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any
Taxing Authority (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") in respect of any Trayport Company

Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller shall provide Purchasers with
a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding,
(ii) Seller shall consult with Purchasers and offer Purchasers an opportunity

Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, of the Non-controlling Party if such

controlling Party or any of its Affiliates. " _Controlling Party_ " shall
mean whichever of Seller (on the one hand) or Purchasers (on the other hand)
are reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with a
Straddle Period Tax Proceeding, and " _Non-controlling Party_ " shall mean
whichever of Seller (on the one hand) or Purchasers (on the other hand) are

Seller and (b) Seller shall not be required to provide any Person with any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return or copy thereof that includes
Seller;  _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that such Tax Returns
would be required to be delivered to Purchasers and would be subject to
Purchasers' review and approval pursuant to this Agreement but for this
_Section 8.5_, the Person that would be required to deliver such Tax Returns
shall instead deliver pro forma Tax Returns relating solely to the
relevant Trayport Company and allow Purchasers to review and approve such pro
forma Tax Returns (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), and Seller
shall reflect Purchasers' reasonable comments to such pro forma Tax Returns on
the Tax Returns actually filed with Taxing Authorities.

for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this _Article VIII_ or a right to
refund of Taxes, (c) conducting any Tax Proceeding, or (d) determining an

portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant portions of
relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing Authorities and
relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and other

documents relating to Tax matters, of the relevant entities for their
respective Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date until the later
of (A) the expiration of the statute of limitations for the Tax periods to
which the Tax Returns and other documents relate or (B) ten years following
the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the Party
holding such Tax Returns or other documents may dispose of them after
offering the other Party reasonable notice and opportunity to take
possession of such Tax Returns and other documents at such other Party's own
expense. Each Party shall make its employees reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents
or information so provided.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 8.7 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Anything in this Agreement
or any other agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all liabilities
and obligations (a) between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the

hand, or (b) at the request of Purchasers, between any of the Trayport
Companies under any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement in effect prior
to the Closing Date (other than this Agreement) shall cease and terminate as
of the Closing Date as to all past, present and future taxable periods, and
the Trayport Companies shall thereafter not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder and all powers of attorney of the Trayport Companies with
respect to Taxes shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and shall be of
no further force of effect.

  



  

Section 8.8 _Timing Differences_.

  



  

(a) Purchasers agree that if (i) there is an audit adjustment (or
adjustment in any other Tax Proceeding) made with respect to any Tax Item by
any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes for which Seller is liable or
responsible (and which liability is actually satisfied by Seller), and (ii)
as a result of such adjustment, Purchasers, the Trayport Companies or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates receives in a Post-Closing Period
an actual reduction in cash Tax liability or any Tax refund in cash, in each
case, in or prior to the taxable year in which the audit or other Tax
Proceeding is concluded or in the succeeding two taxable years, then
Purchasers shall pay to Seller the amount of such reduction or refund within
fifteen (15) days of filing the Tax Return in which such reduction or refund
is actually realized, except to the extent such reduction or refund is
reflected in the determination of Closing Working Capital.

  



  

(b) If Purchasers, the Trayport Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates receives in a Post-Closing Period an
actual reduction in cash Tax liability or any Tax refund in cash arising from
any deduction arising in respect of any Trayport Transaction Expenses that
are borne or paid by Seller, Purchasers acknowledge and agree that they will
pay Seller the amount of any such reduction or refund that results from such
deduction on a Tax Return of Purchasers or any of their Affiliates (including
the Trayport Companies) in or prior to the taxable year in which the
applicable Trayport Transaction Expense is paid or in the succeeding two
taxable years, which amount shall be paid to Seller within fifteen (15) days
of filing the Tax Return in which such reduction or refund is
actually realized, except to the extent such reduction or refund is reflected
in the computation of Closing Working Capital and increases the Closing
Purchase Price.

  



  

Section 8.9 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Seller, Purchasers and
their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this
Agreement (including for breach of warranty or representation) as an
adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless they are
required to treat such payments otherwise by applicable Tax Laws. Accordingly,
any reference in this Agreement to an indemnity in respect of a liability for
the Trayport Entities (or their Subsidiaries) or any obligation of the Parties
to make a payment in respect of the Trayport Entities (or their Subsidiaries)
shall be construed as a reference to a covenant by Seller (for itself and on
behalf of its Affiliates) to pay Purchasers (for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates) an amount equal to such liability or payment.

  



  

   

 | 58|

responsible for all sales, use, value-added, business, goods and
services, transfer, stamp duty (including UK stamp duty), documentary,
conveyancing or similar taxes or expenses that may be imposed as a result of
the Sale, together with any and all penalties, interest and additions to tax
with respect thereto (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), and Seller and Purchasers shall
cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may
be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax Laws.

_however_ , that a Party shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ if the failure by such Party or of any of

(c) by either Purchaser or Seller, if the Closing has not occurred
by December 31, 2017 (the " _Outside Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ if its failure to perform or breach of any
of its material covenants, representations, warranties or obligations under
this Agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the
Sale to occur on or before such date;

  



  

(d) by Seller, if Purchasers shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in

been cured within thirty (30) Business Days after the giving of written notice
by Seller to Purchasers specifying such breach (provided that in no event
shall such 30 Business Day period extend beyond the Outside Date and
provided that Seller is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement);

  



  

   

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) by Purchasers, if Seller shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, which breach cannot be or has not
been cured within thirty (30) Business Days after the giving of written notice
by Purchasers to Seller specifying such breach (provided that in no event
shall such 30 Business Day period extend beyond the Outside Date and
provided that Purchasers are not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement); or

  



  

(f) by Seller, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the
fifth (5th) Business Day following the date that the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 3.1 other than as a result of the failure of
Seller to deliver any of the closing deliveries specified in _Section 3.4_.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is
terminated, no Party (or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
representatives or agents) will have any liability to any other Party to this

willful breach of this Agreement (which shall in all circumstances include a
Party's failure to consummate the Closing on the date that the Closing should
have occurred pursuant to _Section 3.1_) prior to such termination and except
for the obligations set forth in _Section 6.3(c)(i)_, this _Section 9.2_
and _Article X_, which shall survive termination. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event of any breach of Purchasers' obligation to consummate the
Closing, Purchasers' liability will include any Damages (including any
diminution in value of the Trayport Companies) suffered by Seller and its
Affiliates as a result of the failure of the Closing to occur or any
resulting violation of the Final CMA Order.

Section 10.3 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and
Covenants_.

  



  

(a) The representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_
and _Article V_ shall terminate effective as of the Closing and shall not
survive the Closing for any purpose, and thereafter there shall be no
liability on the part of, nor shall any claim (whether predicated on breach
of contract, warranty, tortious conduct, common law, statute, strict liability
or otherwise) be made by, any Party or any of their respective Affiliates in
respect thereof or (except as provided for in the last sentence of _Section
10.3(b)_ regarding covenants and agreements contemplating action (or inaction)
following the Closing) otherwise in respect of or in connection with this
Agreement or transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) After the Closing, there shall be no liability on the part of,
nor shall any claim be made by, any Party or any of their respective
Affiliates in respect of any covenant or agreement to be performed prior to
the Closing. The covenants and agreements that contemplate actions (or
inaction) to be taken (or not taken) after the Closing shall survive in
accordance with their terms.

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.3_ shall not in any
way limit Purchasers' rights to indemnification under _Article VIII_.

  



  

Section 10.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable
to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without
regard to the conflict of laws principles of such State (other than §§ 5-1401
and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law).

  



  

Section 10.5 _Jurisdiction; Venue; Consent to Service of Process_.

  



  

(a) Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of the State
of New York, County of New York, including the federal courts located therein,
should federal jurisdiction requirements exist for any action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement. Each of the Parties consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any
such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. In
addition, each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise (i) any
claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above courts, (ii)
that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution in any
such action or proceeding in the above-named courts, (iii) that such action or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iv) that such action or
proceeding should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of
the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some
other proceeding in any other court other than one of the above-named courts,
or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or
by such courts. Each of the Parties hereby agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding other than before one of the above-named courts. Each of
the Parties also hereby agrees that any final and non-appealable judgment
against a Party in connection with any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and binding on such Party and that such judgment may be enforced in
any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United
States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment. The
foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall not (A) constitute submission to
jurisdiction or general consent to service of process in the State of New
York, County of New York, for any purpose except with respect to any action
or proceeding resulting from, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
(B) be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the respective Parties
to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) To the extent that any Party has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its
property, each of such Seller or Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives such
immunity in respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for the giving of notices pursuant to _Section 10.2_ of this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 10.5_ shall affect the right of any Party
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

Section 10.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect
as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise)
to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form,
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

  



  

Section 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
NGX Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Disclosure Letters and the Non-
Disclosure Agreement and all annexes and exhibits hereto and thereto, embody
the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 10.8 _Amendment, Modification and Waiver_. No amendment to
this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by
each Party. Any failure of a Party to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition contained in this Agreement may be waived by the Party
entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument duly executed
and delivered by the Party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure
to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
prior, subsequent or other failure of compliance.

  



  

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision of this Agreement or invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. In the event
that any provision hereof would be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties intend that such provision
will be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under,
applicable Law, and the Parties agree, to the extent lawful and practicable,
to use their reasonable efforts to enter into arrangements to reinstate the
intended benefits, net of the intended burdens, of any such provision held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

Section 10.10 _Successors and Assigns; No Third-Party
Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and all its provisions shall be binding solely
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, each of which such successors and
permitted assigns will be deemed to be a party hereto for all purposes
hereof. Nothing in this Agreement, whether expressed or implied, will confer
on any Person, other than the Parties or their respective permitted successors
and assigns, any rights, remedies or Liabilities;  _provided,_ that (a) the
provisions of _Section 6.10_ will inure to the benefit of the DandO
Indemnified Persons and (b) the provisions of _Section 6.10(a)_ will inure
to the benefit of Seller's Affiliates. No Party may assign its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Parties and any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void; _provided,_ that each Purchaser may, without the consent of Seller,
assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder to any of its
Subsidiaries that is wholly owned by such Purchaser (although no such
assignment shall relieve Purchasers of their obligations to Seller). For the
avoidance of doubt, the amalgamation or merger (whether forward or reverse)
of any Party to this Agreement with one or more Affiliates of such Party shall
not constitute an assignment for purposes of this _Section 10.10_.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Publicity_. With respect to any information in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby which shall not have been
previously issued or disclosed, except as required by Law (including the
rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange), each of Seller and
Purchasers agree that neither it nor any of its Affiliates will issue a press
release or make any other public statement or release any public
communication with respect thereto without the prior consultation with the
other Party. Purchasers and Seller agree, to the extent possible and legally
permissible, to notify, cooperate and consult with, the other Party prior to
issuing or making any such public statement (and be provided a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such public statement).

  



  

Section 10.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF, IN WHOLE
OR IN PART, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE SALE.

  



  

Section 10.13 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly stated in
this Agreement, any costs, expenses, or charges incurred by any of the Parties
shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost, expense or charge, in each
case, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated. Except as otherwise provided herein, if the Sale is consummated,
all costs, expenses and charges incurred and payable by any of the Trayport
Companies in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the consummation of
the Sale will be Trayport Transaction Expenses.

  



  

Section 10.14 _Specific Performance and Other Equitable Relief_. The
Parties hereby expressly recognize and acknowledge that immediate, extensive
and irreparable damage would result, no adequate remedy at law would exist
and damages would be difficult to determine if any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached. Each Party further acknowledges that a breach or
violation of this Agreement cannot be sufficiently remedied by money damages
alone and, accordingly, each Party shall be entitled, without the need to
post a bond or other security, in addition to damages and any other remedies
provided at law or in equity, to specific performance, injunctive and other
equitable relief to enforce or prevent any violation. Each Party agrees not
to oppose the granting of such equitable relief, and to waive, and to cause
its representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy.

be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i)
the failure or delay on the part of Purchasers to assert any claim or demand
or to enforce any right or remedy against Seller or (ii) any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding instituted by or
against Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 10.15_ or otherwise, Purchasers hereby agree that Guarantor shall
have all defenses to its obligations under this guarantee that would be
available to Seller in respect of this Agreement whether pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement or pursuant to any applicable Law in connection therewith.

respect of this Agreement including all of TMX Group US's payment obligations
hereunder and any obligations or liabilities of TMX Group US arising from any

terms and conditions of this Agreement that may be agreed to by TMX Group US
hereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. TMX Group

reorganization or other similar proceeding instituted by or against TMX Group
US. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
10.15_ or otherwise, Seller hereby agrees that TMX Group Limited shall have
all defenses to its obligations under this guarantee that would be available
to TMX Group US in respect of this Agreement whether pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or pursuant to any applicable Law in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 10.16 _Joint and Several Liability of Purchasers_.
Purchasers shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of each
Purchaser under this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement.
