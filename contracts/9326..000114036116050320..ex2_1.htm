solely in his capacity as the Sellers' Representative (the " _Sellers '
Representative_"), and (h) solely for purposes of _Sections 5.3_
(Non‑Solicitation of Employees), _5.4_ (Non‑Competition), _5.5_
(Confidentiality) and _5.6_ (Unenforceability; Severability; Specific
Performance) and _Article X_ (General Provisions), (i) Angelique (Angie) R.

 _WITNESSETH_ :

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Sellers are the sole owners of one hundred percent (100%) of the
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company (collectively,
the " _Shares_ "); and

  

  

WHEREAS, Sellers desire to sell and transfer to Purchaser, and Purchaser
desires to purchase from Sellers, all of the Shares, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  


 

  

ARTICLE I

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

  


 

  

1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Sellers will sell to Purchaser, and
Purchaser will purchase from Sellers, all of the Shares, free and clear of all
Liens.

  


 

  

1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration for the Shares (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") shall be One Hundred Eleven Million Five Hundred
Twenty‑Four Thousand Dollars ($111,524,000), (a) _increased_ on a
dollar‑for‑dollar basis by the amount of Closing Cash, (b) _decreased_ on a
dollar‑for‑dollar basis by the amount of Closing Debt, (c) _decreased_ on a

  

    

  

dollar‑for‑dollar basis by the amount of any Transaction Costs that were not
paid by the Company prior to the Closing (" _Unpaid Transaction Costs_ ") and
(d) _increased or reduced_ on a dollar‑for‑dollar basis by the amount by which
Closing Working Capital is _more or less_ than Fifteen Million Six Hundred
Sixty‑Eight Thousand Six Hundred Thirty‑Five Dollars ($15,668,635). At the
Closing, Purchaser shall (i) pay to Sellers on a pro rata basis in accordance
with their respective Allocable Portion an amount equal to the Estimated
Purchase Price (as defined below), _less_ Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000)
(the " _Escrow Deposit_ "), and (ii) deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow
Deposit as provided in _Section 7.3_ , to be held, released or disposed of by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  

1.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company delivered to Purchaser a written
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith
written estimate of Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Unpaid Transaction Costs and
Closing Working Capital, in each case determined in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the application of such principles in the
preparation of the Balance Sheet. The Estimated Closing Statement was
accompanied by a certificate executed by the Company's Chief Financial Officer
to the effect that the Estimated Closing Statement was prepared in good faith
in accordance with this _Section 1.3(a)_.

  


 

  

(b) The Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be calculated in
accordance with _Section 1.2_ as if Sellers' estimate of Closing Cash, Closing
Debt, Unpaid Transaction Costs and Closing Working Capital set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement was the actual amount of Closing Cash, Closing
Debt, Unpaid Transaction Costs and Closing Working Capital. The Purchase Price
as so estimated is referred to herein as the " _Estimated Purchase Price_."

  


 

  

(c) On or prior to the date that is ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser will prepare and deliver to the Sellers' Representative a
statement (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Purchaser's
calculation of (i) Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Unpaid Transaction Costs and
Closing Working Capital, in each case determined in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the application of such principles in the
preparation of the Balance Sheet, and (ii) the Purchase Price. The Sellers'
Representative will cooperate with Purchaser and provide to it such
information as Purchaser may reasonably request, in each case in connection
with Purchaser's preparation of the Final Closing Statement.

  


 

  

(d) Upon the Sellers' Representative's written request and after the execution
by Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative of a customary confidentiality
agreement mutually acceptable to such parties, Purchaser shall make available
to the Sellers' Representative a complete copy of all work papers and other
books, records, documents and instruments utilized or relied on by Purchaser
in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement. The Sellers' Representative
shall notify Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) days after the Sellers'
Representative's receipt of the Final Closing Statement that the Sellers'
Representative accepts for and on behalf of Sellers the Final Closing
Statement or, alternatively, that there is a dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ ")
as to any item reflected thereon. The Dispute Notice will set forth

  

  

 

\- 2 -  

  

the Sellers' Representative's objections on behalf of Sellers, if any, to the
Final Closing Statement in reasonable detail. The failure by the Sellers'
Representative to give Purchaser a Dispute Notice within such period shall be
deemed to constitute Sellers' acceptance of the Final Closing Statement. After
delivery of a Dispute Notice by the Sellers' Representative that there is a
dispute as to any item reflected in the Final Closing Statement, the parties
will use reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute, but if such dispute
cannot be resolved by the parties within thirty (30) days after the Sellers'
Representative delivers a Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be referred to
KPMG LLP (the " _Selected Accountants_ "). In resolving any disputed item, the
Selected Accountants (i) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section

Purchaser, and any violation of those restrictions would cause substantial
injury to Purchaser and that Purchaser would not have entered into this

written notice of such claim within twenty (20) days following the Indemnified

the Sellers' Representative (if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser
Indemnified Party) or Purchaser (if the Indemnified Party is a Seller

\- 38 -  

  

responsibility is so acknowledged, or take such other action as is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to provide assurance for the performance
of the Indemnifying Parties' obligations hereunder, and/or (ii) give written
notice to Purchaser (if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified
Party) or the Sellers' Representative (if the Indemnified Party is a Seller
Indemnified Party) of the Indemnifying Parties' intention to dispute or
contest all or part of such responsibility. Upon delivery of such notice of
intention to contest, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative will negotiate
in good faith for a period of at least thirty (30) days to resolve as promptly
as possible any dispute as to responsibility for, or the amount of, any such
indemnification claim.

sole expense, to control the defense of any claim brought by any third Person
(as to which indemnification is sought pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ) with
counsel of such Indemnifying Party's choice that is reasonably satisfactory to
the Sellers' Representative (if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified
Party) or Purchaser (if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified
Party), and shall have the right to settle or otherwise protect against the
imposition of Liability with respect to any such claim, in each case if the
Sellers' Representative (if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified
Party) or Purchaser (if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified Party)
shall have taken the action described in clause (i) of the first sentence of
_Section 8.4(c)_ with respect to such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that:

  


 

  

(i) the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such claim and to employ counsel at their own cost and expense to assist in
the handling of such claim and shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to assert any and all cross‑claims and counterclaims they may have;

  


 

  

(ii) such Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Sellers' Representative (if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified
Party) or Purchaser (if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified
Party) before entering into any settlement of any such claim or ceasing to
defend against any such claim, if pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed
against such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or (if such Indemnified Party
is a Purchaser Indemnified Party) such settlement or cessation could, in the
reasonable and good faith opinion of Purchaser, have an adverse effect on the
Transferred Companies;

  


 

  

(iii) such Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of
a written release from all Liability in respect of such claim; and

  


 

  

(iv) at the election of the Indemnified Party, such Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall have joint control over the defense or settlement of
any

  

  

 

\- 39 -  

  

such claim, each party to employ counsel at its own cost and expense, to the
extent such claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief against
such Indemnified Party or, if such Indemnified Party is a Purchaser
Indemnified Party, to the extent such claim could, in the reasonable good
faith opinion of Purchaser, have an adverse effect on the business of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the Transferred
Companies, or adversely affect the Liability of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies, for
Taxes.

  


 

  

In the event the Indemnifying Party shall fail to defend, contest or otherwise
protect against the imposition of any such damages as to any such claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend,
contest or assert any cross‑claim or counterclaim or otherwise protect against
such claim and may make any compromise or settlement thereof and recover from
and be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party for the entire reasonable cost
thereof, including from legal expenses, disbursements and all amounts paid as
a result of such matter or claim. If the Sellers' Representative (if the
Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party) or Purchaser (if the
Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified Party) does not take the action
described in clause (i) of the first sentence of _Section 8.4(c)_ with respect
to a matter or claim, the Indemnified Party shall, without limitation of its
rights under this _Article VIII_ , retain sole control over the defense or
settlement of such matter or claim.

  


 

  

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Article VIII_ are in
addition to all other rights or remedies the Indemnified Parties may have
under this Agreement or otherwise and will continue in effect notwithstanding

rights.

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

  


 

  

9.1 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) The Sellers' Representative will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed with respect to the Transferred Companies for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (any such period, a " _Pre
‑Closing Period_"). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the past practice of the Transferred Companies. Drafts of all
such Tax Returns shall be provided to Purchaser for its review and comment at
least thirty (30) days prior to filing with the applicable Tax authority. No
such Tax Returns shall be filed without Purchaser's prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, denied or delayed. Following
the Closing, the Indemnifying Sellers will pay, and will, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and
against any Taxes imposed upon the Transferred Companies for any Pre‑Closing
Period (except to the extent that the Liability for such Taxes was included in
the calculation of Closing Working Capital).

  


 

  

(b) Purchaser will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to
be filed by or on behalf of the Transferred Companies for any taxable period
beginning before but ending after the Closing Date (any such period, a "
_Straddle Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that drafts of any such Tax
Returns (any such Tax Return, a " _Straddle Period Tax Return_ ") shall be
provided to the Sellers' Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to
filing with the applicable Tax authority for the Sellers' Representative's
review, comment and approval. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the past practice of the Transferred Companies, except
as required by applicable Legal Requirements or as would not

  

  

 

\- 41 -  

  

affect the Indemnifying Sellers' Liability or indemnification obligation
hereunder. Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any disputed items on a Straddle Period Tax Return. The
Indemnifying Sellers will, within fifteen (15) days after the date on which
the Straddle Period Tax Return is filed by Purchaser with the applicable Tax
authority, reimburse Purchaser for, and will, jointly and severally, indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against the amount of
Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date, except to the extent the Liability for such Taxes was included in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital. For purposes of this _Section 9.1(b)_
, in the case of any Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes in the nature of property or
ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and
(ii) in the case of any Taxes _other than_ property or ad valorem Taxes, be
deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period
ended on the day immediately before the Closing Date, except that exemptions,
allowances and deductions (such as depreciation deductions) calculated on an
annual basis shall be prorated between the portion of the applicable Straddle
Period that ends on the day immediately before the Closing Date and the
portion on and after the Closing Date on a per diem basis. Any Taxes
(including estimated Taxes) paid by any of the Transferred Companies with
respect to any Straddle Period prior to the Closing or included in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital shall be credited against the
Indemnifying Sellers' Liability pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ , and, to
the extent such Taxes paid prior to the Closing exceed such Liability,
Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Companies to pay the excess to the
Sellers' Representative for and on behalf of Sellers within fifteen (15) days
after filing the Tax Return for the Straddle Period with the applicable Tax
authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that such Taxes paid
prior to the Closing exceed the total amount of Taxes due for the Straddle
Period, _Section 9.1(c)_ shall apply.

  


 

  

(c) Sellers' Representative for and on behalf of the Sellers will be entitled
to receive prompt payment from Purchaser or the Transferred Companies of, any
refund for overpayment of Taxes for which Sellers are responsible pursuant to
_Sections 9.1(a)_ or _(b)_ , except to the extent such Taxes were reflected as
a current asset in the calculation of Closing Working Capital; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser and the Transferred Companies shall be entitled to
retain any refund resulting from a carryback of Tax attributes from any
taxable period or portion thereof after the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(d) Purchaser will promptly notify the Sellers' Representative in writing upon
receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Companies) of notice of any pending or threatened audit or
assessment with respect to Taxes for which Sellers could be required to pay
pursuant to _Sections 9.1(a)_ or _(b)_ or indemnify Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates pursuant to _Section 8.2_. The Sellers' Representative (for and on
behalf of Sellers) will have the right to represent the Transferred Companies'
interest in any audit, administrative or court proceeding relating solely to
any Pre‑Closing Period, including the right to control, compromise and settle
any such proceeding, and to decide whether any Consents or waivers to extend
the applicable statutes of limitations will be granted, and to employ counsel
of the Sellers' Representative's choice at the

  

  

 

\- 42 -  

  

Sellers' cost and expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have
the right to participate in any such audit, administrative or other court
proceeding at its sole cost and expense, and no such matter shall be settled
or compromised by the Sellers' Representative without Purchaser's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, denied or
delayed. Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall jointly control any
audit, administrative or court proceeding relating to any Straddle Period,
with each party responsible for fees and expenses of its own representatives.

  


 

  

(e) After the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative for and
on behalf of Sellers will each provide the other (subject to reimbursement by
the other party for any out‑of‑pocket costs or expenses) with such assistance
as may reasonably be requested by the other party or parties in connection
with the preparation of any return, report or form with respect to Taxes or
any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (such assistance to include
assistance in data collection and responses to information requests) relating
to Liability for Taxes of the Transferred Companies.

  


 

  

(f) All documentary, stamp, transfer, sales, use, excise and similar Taxes
imposed upon Sellers or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
(including the Transferred Companies) as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by Sellers. The Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser will cooperate in preparing and filing any forms
required with respect to any such Taxes. Each party filing a Tax Return in
respect of such Taxes will provide the non‑filing party a true copy of each
such Tax Return as filed and evidence of the timely filing thereof. The
Sellers' Representative will be responsible for preparing and timely filing
(and Purchaser will cooperate with the Sellers' Representative in preparing
and filing) any forms required with respect to any such Taxes. The Sellers'
Representative will provide to Purchaser a true, correct and complete copy of
each such Tax Return as filed and evidence of the timely filing thereof.

  


 

  

(g) Any amount paid by or on behalf of any party to or on behalf of another
party pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price

  


 

  

(h) Neither Purchaser nor the Company or any of the other Transferred
Companies, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall make any election
under Code Section 338 (or any corresponding provision of state, local or
non‑U.S. Tax law) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
of a conflict between _Article VIII_ (Indemnification) and _Article IX_
(Certain Tax Matters), _Article IX_ shall govern and control. The
indemnification obligations pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall survive until
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
taking into account any extensions.

more valid, legal and enforceable provisions that, insofar as practicable,
implement the purposes and intents hereof. To the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, each party waives any provision of any Legal
Requirement that renders any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect.

this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements, and exercising, on behalf
of all of the Indemnifying Sellers, the rights and powers of the Indemnifying

divorce of any Indemnifying Seller. Each of the Indemnifying Sellers hereby
irrevocably appoints the Sellers' Representative as his, her or its lawful
agent and attorney to accept and acknowledge service of any and all process
against such Indemnifying Seller in any Action arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or out of

and upon whom such process may be served, with the same force and legal effect
as if such Indemnifying Seller had been duly and lawfully served with such
process, and each of the Indemnifying Sellers hereby waives all claims of
error by reason of such service. Execution of this Agreement by the
Indemnifying Sellers shall constitute the agreement of each such Indemnifying
Seller to be bound by the actions of the Sellers' Representative taken

addressed by the Sellers' Representative shall be decided by the Sellers'
Representative, but _only_ after consultation with and receiving input and
advice from DeWayne regarding such matter, but the decision of the Sellers'
Representative shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Indemnifying
Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, and in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, confusion or dispute, Stephen shall serve as the Sellers'
Representative, and his decisions, determinations and actions shall be final,

Representative are fully authorized and binding upon the Sellers'
Representative and the Indemnifying Sellers, and Purchaser shall have no
obligation to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of
any of the obligations of the Sellers' Representative contained in this
Agreement or any other agreement, including whether or not the Sellers'
Representative has consulted with or sought input and advice from DeWayne as

this Agreement in his capacity as a Seller); (ii) to (A) dispute or refrain

engagement constitute property of any client(s) of DJP or RQN, Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall hold such property rights (and _not_ the
Company or any of the other Transferred Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates), and (iii) neither DJP nor
RQN shall have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney‑client communications or files (whether electronic, paper or
otherwise) to the Company or any of the other Transferred Companies or any of
