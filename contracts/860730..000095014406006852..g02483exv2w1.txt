Corporation").

(the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the

         Section 2.5. Organizational Documents. At the Effective Time, (a) the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to

                    EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
                         OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

         Section 3.1. Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, pursuant
to this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of the Shares:

                  (a) Each share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of
         the Company (the "Common Stock") and each share of Nonvoting Common
         Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Nonvoting Common
         Stock" and, together with the shares of Common Stock, the "Shares")
         held by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise owned by Parent
         immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Shares acquired
         by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
         Equity Rollover Commitment or other agreements with holders of Shares
         (including Restricted Shares)) shall be canceled and retired and shall
         cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made or
         delivered with respect thereto. Each Share owned by any wholly-owned
         Subsidiary of Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
         shall remain outstanding after the Effective Time.

                  (b) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
         Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
         Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid
         and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c) Each Share (including any Restricted Shares) issued and
         outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
         to be canceled or to remain outstanding pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and
         Dissenting Shares), automatically shall be canceled and converted into
         the right to receive $51.00 in cash, without interest (the

                                                                              11


         "Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender
         of the stock certificate formerly representing such Share (a
         "Certificate") in the manner provided in Section 3.2. Such Shares,
         other than those canceled or that remain outstanding pursuant to
         Section 3.1(a) and Dissenting Shares, sometimes are referred to herein
         as the "Merger Shares."

                  (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
         contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
         thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
         the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled pursuant to
         Section 3.1(a)) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have
         not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented
         thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights
         with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with,
         Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") will not be
         convertible into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
         holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment
         of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
         provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails
         to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal
         and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such
         holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right,
         such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been
         converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time,
         the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
         thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment
         of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time, any
         holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
         thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
         provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i)
         notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares
         and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations
         and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The Company
         shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
         payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such
         demands.

                  (e) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
         Time the number of outstanding Shares is changed into a different
         number of shares or a different class (other than the conversion of any
         shares of Nonvoting Common Stock to shares of Common Stock), by reason
         of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
         split-up, combination, exchange of shares or the like, other than
         pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger Consideration payable per
         Share shall be correspondingly adjusted.

                  (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and
         agree that the contribution of Shares (including Restricted Shares) to
         Parent pursuant to the Equity Rollover Commitment or other agreements
         with holders of Shares (including Restricted Shares) shall be deemed to
         occur immediately prior to the Effective Time and prior to any other
         above-described event.

         Section 3.2. Payment of Cash for Merger Shares. (a) Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall (i) designate a bank or trust company that is
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "Paying Agent") and (ii) enter into a
paying agent agreement, in form and substance



<PAGE>
                                                                              12


reasonably satisfactory to Parent, with such Paying Agent, to serve as the
Paying Agent for the Merger Consideration and payments in respect of the Company
Options and RSUs, unless another agent is designated as provided in Section
3.3(a). Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
deposit, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the
Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of all Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time plus any cash necessary to pay for Company Options and RSUs
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 3.3(a).
Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the Paying Agent, such cash
shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares, RSUs and
Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall
not be used for any other purposes; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation may direct the Paying Agent to invest such cash in (i) obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market accounts, certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreement or banker's acceptances of, or demand deposits with,
commercial banks having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which
are publicly available), or (iii) commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1
or better by Standard & Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investor Services, Inc.
Any profit or loss resulting from, or interest and other income produced by,
such investments shall be for the account of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the
         Surviving Corporation shall send, or cause the Paying Agent to send, to
         each record holder of Merger Shares entitled to receive the Merger
         Consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging
         their Merger Shares for the Merger Consideration payable therefor. The
         letter of transmittal will be in customary form and will specify that
         delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
         thereof) will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only
         upon delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
         lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender of Certificate or
         Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
         Paying Agent together with a properly completed and duly executed
         letter of transmittal and any other documentation that the Paying Agent
         may reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to
         receive the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor, less any
         amounts required to be withheld for Tax. Until so surrendered and
         exchanged, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be
         deemed to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
         and until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the
         holder of such outstanding Certificate in respect thereof.

                  (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the
         registered holder of the Merger Shares formerly represented by the
         Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall
         be a condition to such payment that the Certificate or Certificates so
         surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
         for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
         the Paying Agent any applicable stock transfer taxes required as a
         result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
         such Merger Shares or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
         Paying Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not
         payable.

                  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
         transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that
         were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
         settle transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time.
         If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
         Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such shares shall be
         canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
         accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article III.

                  (e) If any cash deposited with the Paying Agent remains
         unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be
         returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who
         has not surrendered such holder's Certificates for the Merger
         Consideration prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the
         Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Merger Sub, the Company, the
         Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
         of Certificates for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
         any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
         by holders of Certificates as of a date immediately prior to such time
         that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
         Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
         Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date,
         free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
         entitled thereto.

                  (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to
         capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date after the
         Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
         Certificate, including Dissenting Shares.

                  (g) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares
         (other than Dissenting Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the
         Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
         Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
         provided in this Agreement.

                  (h) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
         destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
         claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition
         to the posting by such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as
         the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity
         against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation
         with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
         exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the proper
         amount of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof entitled to be
         received pursuant to this Agreement.

                  (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
         shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
         otherwise payable hereunder and any amounts to be paid hereunder in
         respect of Company Options or RSUs any amounts required to be deducted
         and withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts
         are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the
         applicable Tax authority and shall be treated for all purposes as

         Section 3.3. Treatment of Options and Other Awards. (a) As of the
Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder of Company
Options with respect to such holder's Company Options, each Company Option will
be cancelled and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to
receive an amount in cash equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the product of (i)
the number of Shares subject to such Company Option and (ii) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option,
without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under
any applicable Law. All payments with respect to canceled Company Options shall
be made by the Paying Agent (or such other agent reasonably acceptable to Parent
as the Company shall designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at
the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance
with Section 3.2(a).

                  (b) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by
         Parent and a holder of Restricted Shares with respect to such holder's
         Restricted Shares, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the
         Effective Time subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant
         to any Company Stock Plan or any applicable restricted stock award
         agreement (each a "Restricted Share") which is outstanding immediately
         prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such
         restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective
         Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
         Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(c).

                  (c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
         that except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder of RSUs with
         respect to such holder's RSUs, (i) immediately prior to the Effective
         Time, each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan entitling the
         holder thereof to Restricted Shares, shares of Common Stock or cash
         equal to or based on the value of Common Stock (collectively, "RSUs")
         which, in each case, is outstanding as of the Effective Time, shall
         vest and become free of any lapse restriction (without regard to
         whether the RSUs are then vested or the applicable restrictions have
         lapsed) and, as of the Effective Time be canceled, and (ii) at the
         Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
         amount in cash equal to the (1) product of (A) the number of shares
         previously subject to such RSU and (B) the Merger Consideration, and
         the (2) the value of any deemed dividend equivalents accrued but unpaid
         with respect to such RSUs, less any amounts required to be withheld
         under any applicable Law. All payments with respect to canceled RSUs
         shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other agent reasonably
         acceptable to Parent as the Company shall designate prior to the
         Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
         Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the direction of the
         Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance with Section
         3.2(a).

                  (d) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by
         Parent and a participant, all amounts withheld by the Company on behalf
         of the participants in the HCA Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the HCA
         Inc. Amended and Restated Management Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock
         Purchase Plans", and such participants, the "Participants")) from the
         beginning of the applicable existing salary deferral periods through
         the Effective Time will be deemed to have been used to purchase Common
         Stock pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Plans, using the
         Effective Time as the last date



<PAGE>
                                                                              15


         of the applicable offering period under the Stock Purchase Plans (the
         "Deemed Purchase") and each such share of Common Stock will be deemed
         to have been cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
         Merger Consideration, such that, as of the Effective Time, on a net
         basis, each Participant shall be entitled to receive, without interest
         and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
         applicable Law, (i) refund by the Company of all deferrals made to the
         Stock Purchase Plans by the Participant during the applicable existing
         salary deferral periods and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the excess
         (if any) of (A) the product of (1) the number of Shares that the
         Participant is deemed to have acquired pursuant to the terms of the
         applicable Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to the applicable Deemed
         Purchase and (2) the Merger Consideration, over (B) the aggregate
         amount of the Participant's purchase price deemed to have been paid in
         the Deemed Purchase (such cash amount described in (ii) being the "Net
         SPP Payment"). All Net SPP Payments shall be paid by the Paying Agent
         (or such other agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the Company
         shall designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably
         practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the
         direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in
         accordance with Section 3.2(a). However, in connection with the
         foregoing, if and to the extent permitted by the applicable Stock
         Purchase Plan, on or after the date of this Agreement, in no event (i)
         shall any person who is not currently participating in any Stock
         Purchase Plan be permitted to begin participating in any Stock Purchase
         Plan, and (ii) shall any person who is currently participating in any
         Stock Purchase Plan be permitted to increase the amount of salary that
         may otherwise be deferred and deemed used to purchase shares of Common
         Stock under any Stock Purchase Plan from that level of salary deferral
         amount in effect as of the date of this Agreement; and provided,
         further, that in no event may any new salary deferral period commence
         after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

                  (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such
         resolutions and will take such other actions as may be reasonably
         required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 3.3,
         without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations
         on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent and Merger Sub by the Company concurrently
with entering into this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter") or as may be
disclosed in reasonable detail in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Merger Sub
that:

         Section 4.1. Corporate Existence and Power. Each of the Company and
each Material Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize the concept of good standing), except in the case of the Material
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good
standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the
Company, each Material Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each
Company Joint Venture has all

                                                                              16


corporate or similar powers and authority required to own, lease and operate its
respective properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except in
the case of the Material Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures, where the
failure to have such power and authority has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Each of the Company and each Material Subsidiary is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed or qualified has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Neither the Company nor any Material Subsidiary nor, to the
Company's knowledge, any Company Joint Venture, is in violation of its
organizational or governing documents in any material respect.

         Section 4.2. Corporate Authorization. (a) The Company has the corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to the
adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Requisite Stockholder Vote"), to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to
perform each of its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company. Except for the
adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Vote, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement
or to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
Board of Directors of the Company has taken all actions necessary to ensure that
the supermajority voting provisions of Article Fourteenth of the Company's
Restated Certificate of Incorporation are not applicable to the Merger or the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the Company. The Board
of Directors of the Company, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the
Special Committee, at a duly held meeting has (i) determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders (other than holders of Shares
that are Affiliates of Parent or holders of Shares being contributed to Parent
in connection with the Merger), and declared it advisable, to enter into this
Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
the Company approve the adoption of this Agreement and directed that such matter
be submitted for consideration of the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholder Meeting.

                  (b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
         delivered by the Company and, assuming the due and valid execution and
         delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
         legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
         the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability
         may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
         similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
         and general equitable principles.

         Section 4.3. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
by the

Company do not and will not require any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, action by, filing with or notification to any Governmental Authority,
other than (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger; (ii) compliance with the
applicable requirements of the HSR Act; (iii) the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act including the filing of the Company Proxy Statement and the
Schedule 13E-3; (iv) compliance with the rules and regulations of the New York

or blue sky laws; (vi) the consents and/or notices listed in Section 4.3 of the
Company Disclosure Letter; and (vii) any such consent, approval, authorization,
permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain
would not (A) individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or (B) reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

         Section 4.4. Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene or conflict with the organizational or governing documents of (A) the
Company or (B) any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company's Knowledge, Company
Joint Ventures; (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referenced in Section
4.3 and the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Vote, contravene or conflict
with or constitute a violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Company Joint Ventures
or any of their respective properties or assets; (iii) require the consent,
approval or authorization of, or notice to or filing with any third party with
respect to, result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) or
result in the loss of benefit under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, amendment or acceleration of any right or obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in the creation of any Lien on any
of the properties or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,
license, permit or other instrument or obligation (each, a "Contract") to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties or assets are
bound, except in the case of clauses (i)(B), (ii) and (iii) above, which would
not (A) individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or (B) reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

Company consists of 1,600,000,000 shares of Common Stock, 50,000,000 shares of

         Options and HTI Warrants; (iii) Company Options or other rights or
         options to acquire from the Company or its Subsidiaries, or obligations
         of the Company or its Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital
         stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable
         for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company or such
         Subsidiary, as the case may be; or (iv) equity equivalent interests in
         the ownership or earnings of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other
         similar rights (the items in clauses (i) through (iv) collectively,

         Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
         any Company Securities. There are no preemptive rights of any kind

         has issued, sold, repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired any
         Company Securities, and their respective Boards of Directors have not
         authorized any of the foregoing.

                  (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         entered into any commitment, arrangement or agreement, or are otherwise

<PAGE>
                                                                              19


                  (b) Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
         a list of all Company Joint Ventures. All equity interests of any
         Subsidiary of the Company and the Company Joint Ventures held by the

         fully paid and non-assessable and were not issued in violation of any
         preemptive or similar rights, purchase option, call, or right of first
         refusal or similar rights. All such equity interests are free and clear
         of any Liens or any other limitations or restrictions on such equity
         interests (including any limitation or restriction on the right to
         vote, pledge or sell or otherwise dispose of such equity interests)
         other than Permitted Liens.

         Section 4.7. Reports and Financial Statements. (a) The Company has
filed all forms, reports, statements, certifications and other documents

States federal securities Laws since January 1, 2003 (all such forms, reports,
statements, certificates and other documents filed since January 1, 2003, with
any amendments thereto, collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"), each of which,
including any financial statements or schedules included therein, as finally
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, has complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
Exchange Act as of the date filed with the SEC. None of the Company's
Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC. None of the
Company SEC Reports contained, when filed with the SEC and, if amended, as of
the date of such amendment, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in

         unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and normal year-end audit
         adjustments as permitted by the rules related to Quarterly Reports on
         Form 10-Q promulgated under the Exchange Act), in all material
         respects, the results of the consolidated operations and changes in
         stockholders' equity and cash flows and consolidated financial position
         of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods
         or as of the respective dates therein set forth. Each of such
         consolidated financial statements (including the related notes and
         schedules, where applicable) complies in all material respects with
         applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
         regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and each of such financial
         statements (including the related notes and schedules, where
         applicable) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
         during the periods involved, except in each case as indicated in such
         statements or in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
         statements, as permitted by the rules related to Quarterly Reports on
         Form 10-Q promulgated under the Exchange Act.

                  (c) Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be
         expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
         Effect on the Company, the management of the Company (i) has
         implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material

         information relating to the Company, including its consolidated
         Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the
         chief financial officer of the Company by others within those entities
         and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
         the date of this Agreement, to the Company's outside auditors and the
         audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (x) any
         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
         operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
         Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
         adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize
         and report financial information and (y) any fraud, known to the
         Company, whether or not material, that involves management or other
         employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal
         controls over financial reporting.

         Section 4.8. Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (i) for those liabilities
that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company (including the notes thereto) included in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, (ii) for liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2005, (iii) for liabilities that have been discharged or paid in full prior to
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, (iv) for liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (v) for liabilities that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued or contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due).

         Section 4.9. Disclosure Documents. The proxy statement (the "Company
Proxy Statement") and the Rule 13e-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3
(the "Schedule 13E-3") relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, to be filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with
seeking the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company will
not, at the time it is filed with the SEC, or, in the case of the Company Proxy
Statement, at the time it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or
at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company will cause
the Company Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 and all related SEC filings to
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange
Act applicable thereto as of the date of such filing. No representation is made
by the Company with respect to statements made in the Company Proxy Statement or
the Schedule 13E-3 based on information supplied, or required to be supplied, by

         been properly prepared and timely filed, and all such Tax Returns
         (including information provided therewith or with respect thereto) are
         true, correct and complete, except for Tax Returns as to which the
         failure to so file or be true, complete and correct would not
         reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
         Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                  (b) The Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company Joint
         Ventures have fully and timely paid all Taxes (whether or not shown to
         be due on the Tax Returns referred to in Section 4.12(a)), except for
         Taxes being contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves

                  (d) There are no Tax sharing agreements (or similar
         agreements) under which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
         Company's Knowledge, any Company Joint Venture could be liable for the
         Tax liability of an entity that is neither the Company nor any or its
         Subsidiaries, nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any Company Joint
         Venture, except for such agreements that would not reasonably be
         expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
         Effect on the Company.

                  (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
         corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free

         date of this Agreement.

                  (f) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered
         into a "listed transaction" that has given rise to a disclosure
         obligation under Section 6011 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations

         Tax Return of the Company or relevant Subsidiary.

other material employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other
arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA, whether formal or informal, under
which any Company Employee has any present or future right to benefits,
maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability
(the "Company Benefit Plans"), individually and in the aggregate, no event has
occurred and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set
of circumstances, in connection with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law and no nonexempt
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code) or "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is

         increase materially the annual expense of maintaining such plan above
         the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal
         year. No Company Benefit Plan or Company Stock Plan exists that could
         (i) result in the payment to any Company Employee of any money or other
         property, (ii) accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits
         (including funding of compensation or benefits through a trust or
         otherwise) to any Company Employee, or (iii) limit or restrict the
         ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to merge, amend or terminate
         any Company Benefit Plan, in each case, as a result of the execution of
         this Agreement or otherwise related in any way to the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement; and no such payment would reasonably

                  (c) Schedule 4.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
         forth a list of all material Company Benefit Plans. The Company has
         made available to Parent true and complete copies of all material
         Company Benefit Plans.

                  (d) All Company Options have been granted in accordance with
         the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and applicable Law
         (including, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code), with an
         exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the
         underlying Common Stock on the date of any such grant, except for such
         failures, if any, to be so granted which would not reasonably be
         expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
         Effect on the Company.

Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each of the Company Joint
Ventures is, and at all times since December 31, 2003 has been, in compliance
with all Laws applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Company Joint
Ventures and their respective businesses and activities, except for such
noncompliance that has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                  (b) The Company is, and at all times since December 14, 2000
         has been, in compliance in all material respects with the requirements
         of the Corporate Integrity Agreement (the "CIA"), dated as of December
         14, 2000, between the Company and the Office of Inspector General of
         the United States Department of Health and Human Services (the "OIG").

                  (c) The Company has not received any written, or to the
         Company's Knowledge, oral notice from the OIG that the Company is not
         in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the CIA.

                  (d) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company has and
         maintains in full force and effect, and is in compliance with, all
         Permits and all orders from Governmental Authorities necessary for the
         Company and each Subsidiary to carry on their respective businesses as
         currently conducted, except as has not had, and would not reasonably be
         expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
         Effect on the Company.

financial advisor or other firm or person except Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co, Incorporated is or will be entitled to any broker's

opinion to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration
to be received by holders of Shares (other than holders of Shares that are
Affiliates of Parent or holders of Shares being contributed to Parent in
connection with the Merger) in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

         Section 4.17. Affiliate Transactions. Except for this Agreement and the
Merger, there are no transactions, or series of related transactions,

Company Subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures), on the other hand, that
would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act.

         Section 4.18. Rights Agreement; Anti-Takeover Provisions. The Company
does not have any stockholder rights plans in effect. The Board of Directors of
the Company has taken all necessary action so that the provisions of Section 203
of the DGCL and any takeover, anti-takeover, moratorium, "fair price", "control
share" or other similar Law enacted under any Law applicable to the Company
(each, a "Takeover Statute") do not, and will not, apply to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                                                                              26


party thereto have committed, subject to the terms thereof, to lend the amounts
set forth therein (the "Debt Financing"), and (ii) the equity commitment
letters, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from (i) Bain Capital Fund IX,
L.P., (ii) KKR Millennium Fund, L.P. and KKR PEI Investments, L.P., and (iii) ML
Global Private Equity Fund, L.P. (the "Equity Financing Commitments" and
together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the "Financing Commitments"),
pursuant to which such parties have committed, subject to the terms thereof, to
invest the cash amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and together
with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). Prior to the date of this Agreement,
(i) none of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified, and (ii) the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Each of the Equity Financing Commitments,
in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and the other parties thereto. Each of the Debt
Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect as
of the date of this Agreement and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto for so long as
it remains in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, one or more Debt Financing Commitments may be superseded at the
option of Parent after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective
Time by instruments (the "New Financing Commitments") which replace existing
Debt Financing Commitments and/or contemplate co-investment by or financing from
one or more other or additional parties; provided, that the terms of the New
Financing Commitments shall not (a) expand upon the conditions precedent to the
Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments in any material respect
or (b) reasonably be expected to delay the Closing. In such event, the term
"Financing Commitments" as used herein shall be deemed to include the Financing
Commitments that are not so superseded at the time in question and the New
Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term
or condition of the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the
Financing Commitments. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees
incurred in connection with the Financing Commitments. Assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b), the Financing
Commitments, when funded, will provide the Surviving Corporation with financing
immediately after the Effective Time sufficient to consummate the Merger upon
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses associated therewith, including payment of all amounts under Article
III of this Agreement.

         Section 5.8. Equity Rollover Commitment. Parent has delivered to the
Company a true and complete copy of the equity rollover letter, dated as of the
date hereof, from Frisco Inc. and Frisco Partners (the "Equity Rollover
Commitment"), pursuant to which such party has committed to contribute to Parent
that number of Shares set forth in such letter in exchange for shares of capital
stock of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (which Shares shall be
cancelled in the Merger, as provided in Section 3.1(a)). As of the date of this
Agreement, the Equity Rollover Commitment is in full force and effect.

Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the guarantees of each of (i)
Bain Capital Fund IX, L.P., (ii) KKR Millennium Fund, L.P., (iii) ML Global
Private Equity Fund, L.P. and (iv) Frisco Inc. and Frisco Partners (the

(the "Guarantees") and prior to the close of business on the third Business Day
after the date of this Agreement, Parent will cause to be delivered an opinion
of counsel for each Guarantor set forth in Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered an
opinion of counsel for each other Guarantor, in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, as to the enforceability of the
Guarantee of such Guarantor and such other matters reasonably requested by the
Company, which opinion has not been withdrawn or modified.

         Section 5.10. Operations of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time will have
engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or
obligations other than as contemplated herein, including in connection with
arranging the Financing.

provided, that at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote,
the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee if

Recommendation Withdrawal, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and
in accordance with, Section 9.1, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose

information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy
Statement or Schedule 13E-3, as applicable, so that the Company Proxy Statement
or Schedule 13E-3, as applicable, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that

         filed in response to any SEC comments or as required by Law, (iv) use
         its reasonable best efforts to have cleared by the SEC and will
         thereafter mail to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably

         or other materials for meetings such as the Company Stockholder
         Meeting, (v) to the extent required by applicable Law, as promptly as

         time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, and (vi) otherwise use
         commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all requirements of Law
         applicable to the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Merger. Parent
         and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the

         with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to

         the parties contained in Sections 7.2(a) and (b), if any objections are
         asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any

         the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any
         private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
         as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially

         contemplated hereby, each of Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
         reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as
         to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

         which, in any case if not resolved, would reasonably be expected to
         prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
         Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
         however, that no party shall be required to, and the Company may not
         (without the prior written consent of Merger Sub) take any such actions
         to resolve any such objections or suits which actions would reasonably
         be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
         Adverse Effect on the Company.

                  (d) Subject to the obligations under Section 7.2(c), in the
         event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is

         or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction
         contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated
         hereby, each of Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all
         respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts
         to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
         vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
         injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,

the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall not
have access to any books, records and other information the disclosure of which

efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

                  (b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective

         Committee no later than the later of (i) the No-Shop Period Start Date
         and (ii) the Business Day following the date on which the Company
         received such Excluded Party's written Company Acquisition Proposal (it
         being understood, that following the No-Shop Period Start Date until
         such time as the Special Committee determines that a Person is an
         Excluded Party, the Company shall not be permitted to take any action
         with respect to such Person that it would be prohibited from taking
         with respect to a non-Excluded Party pursuant to Section 7.4(c)), on
         the No-Shop Period Start Date the Company shall immediately cease and
         cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
         negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, its
         Subsidiaries or any Representatives with respect to any Company
         Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7.4
         to the contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party
         for all purposes under this Agreement at such time as the Company
         Acquisition Proposal made by such party fails, in the reasonable
         judgment of the Special Committee, to satisfy the requirements of
         Section 7.4(c).

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         Section 7.4(b), if at any time following the date of this Agreement and
         prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, (i) the Company has
         received a written Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party that
         the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
         Committee if such committee still exists) believes in good faith to be
         bona fide, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through
         the Special Committee if such committee still exists) determines in
         good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors
         and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes
         or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and
         (iii) after consultation with its outside counsel, the Board of
         Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee if such
         committee still exists) determines in good faith that the failure to
         take such action could violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
         Law, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the
         Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company
         Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
         with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such
         Company Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company (x) will not,
         and will not allow Company Representatives to, disclose any non-public
         information to such Person without entering into an Acceptable
         Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will promptly provide to Parent any
         non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
         provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to
         Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
         7.4(b) or this Section 7.4(c), prior to obtaining the obtaining the
         Requisite Stockholder Vote, the Company shall be permitted to take the
         actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above with respect to any
         Excluded Party. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
         Company shall promptly (within one Business Day) notify Parent in the
         event it receives a Company Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group
         of related Persons, including the material terms and conditions
         thereof, and shall keep Parent apprised as to the status and any
         material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning the same
         on a current basis (and in any event no later than 48 hours after the
         occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations). Without

         limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (within one Business
         Day) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin
         providing information or to engage in negotiations concerning a Company
         Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons pursuant
         to this Section 7.4(c). Within 24 hours of the No-Shop Period Start
         Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the number of Excluded Parties
         and provide Parent a written summary of the material terms and
         conditions of each Company Acquisition Proposal received from any
         Excluded Party.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
         contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
         Vote, the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal which the
         Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
         Committee, if such committee still exists) concludes in good faith
         constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
         adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (ii)
         below, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
         Special Committee, if such committee still exists) may (x) effect a
         Recommendation Withdrawal and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter
         into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if
         the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
         Committee, if such committee still exists) determines in good faith,
         after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such
         action could violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
         provided, however that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
         pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination
         pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or
         effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays the
         Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 9.2(a); and provided,
         further, that the Board of Directors may not effect a Recommendation
         Withdrawal pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
         Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

                           (i) the Company shall have provided prior written
                  notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least five calendar days
                  in advance (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to effect a
                  Recommendation Withdrawal in response to such Superior
                  Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
                  definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
                  which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions
                  of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
                  party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have
                  contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed
                  transaction agreements with the party making such Superior
                  Proposal and other material documents; and

                           (ii) prior to effecting such Recommendation
                  Withdrawal or terminating this Agreement to enter into a
                  definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
                  the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
                  advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent
                  and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger
                  Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
                  and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company
                  Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

         In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub and to comply with the

requirements of this Section 7.4(d) with respect to such new written notice,
except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three Business Days.

                  (e) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions
         set forth in this Section 7.4 by any Representative of the Company or
         any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
         7.4 by the Company.

                  confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains
                  provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
                  Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
                  Agreements;

                           (ii) "Company Acquisition Proposal" means any
                  inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons
                  other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates
                  relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
                  a business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues,
                  net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
                  taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class or series of
                  Company Securities, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
                  consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons
                  beneficially owning 15% or more of any class or series of
                  capital stock of the Company, or any merger, reorganization,

                  more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company

                           (iii) "Superior Proposal" means a Company Acquisition
                  Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting
                  through the Special Committee, if such committee still exists)
                  in good faith determines, would, if consummated, result in a
                  transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of
                  view to the stockholders of the Company than the transactions
                  contemplated hereby (x) after receiving the advice of a
                  financial advisor (who shall be a nationally recognized
                  investment banking firm), (y) after taking into account the

                  such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted by
                  applicable Law; provided that for purposes of the definition
                  of "Superior Proposal", the references to "15% or more" in the
                  definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
                  be references to "a majority".

         Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its
         stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
         promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, any such disclosure
         (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication
         of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall
         be deemed to be a Recommendation Withdrawal unless the Board of
         Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee if such
         committee still exists) expressly publicly reaffirms

         recommendation in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

                  (h) The parties hereby agree that, in order to facilitate any
         due diligence process that one or more third parties, who have been
         provided with and have agreed in writing to comply with the subject
         matter limitations of this section, may undertake in connection with a
         Company Acquisition Proposal, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. ("Dr. Frist")
         shall not be prevented from engaging in a due diligence discussion with
         each such third party regarding the Company if specifically requested
         to do so by the Special Committee or Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
         LLC; provided, however, that the parties acknowledge and agree that
         except for public disclosure obligations required by applicable law,
         (i) Dr. Frist shall not be permitted to disclose to such third party
         any information regarding the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement, or any agreements, understandings or arrangements in
         connection therewith or any assumptions, information, evaluations or
         views of Parent and its Affiliates and (ii) Dr. Frist shall not be
         permitted to have any discussions, agreements, understandings or
         arrangements with any third party regarding any participation,

         form of transaction similar to, or in the alternative to, the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

         Section 7.5. Director and Officer Liability.

                  (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
         Corporation shall to the greatest extent permitted by Law to indemnify
         and hold harmless (and comply with all of the Company's and its
         Subsidiaries' existing obligations to advance funds for expenses) (i)
         the present and former officers and directors thereof against any and
         all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
         expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
         amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
         claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
         criminal, administrative or investigative ("Damages"), arising out of,
         relating to or in connection with any acts or omissions occurring or
         alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time, including, without
         limitation, the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or
         pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
         (ii) such persons against any and all Damages arising out of acts or
         omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
         director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was
         at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries.

                  (b) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall have
         purchased, and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
         shall maintain, a tail policy to the current policy of directors' and
         officers' liability insurance maintained on the date hereof by the
         Company (the "Current Policy") which tail policy shall be effective for
         a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six
         years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts
         or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time,
         and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and
         amount as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, in
         the aggregate, than the coverage currently provided by the Current
         Policy; provided, however, that in no event



<PAGE>
                                                                              39


         shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in
         excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
         under the Current Policy (the "Insurance Amount"); provided, however,
         that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the Insurance
         Amount, the Company shall be obligated to obtain, and the Surviving
         Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, a policy with the greatest
         coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Insurance Amount.

                  (c) This Section 7.5 shall survive the consummation of the
         Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
         enforceable by, present or former directors or officers of the Company
         or its Subsidiaries, their respective heirs and personal
         representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and
         its successors and assigns. In the event that the Surviving Corporation
         or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
         into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
         corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
         or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
         person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case, Parent
         shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
         assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume and honor the obligations
         set forth in this Section 7.5. The agreements and covenants contained
         herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which
         any such present or former director or officer is entitled, whether
         pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is
         intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair
         any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any
         policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or
         any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and
         employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
         provided for in this Section 7.5 is not prior to or in substitution for
         any such claims under any such policies.

         Section 7.6. Takeover Statutes. The parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (i) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 7.7. Public Announcements. Except with respect to any
Recommendation Withdrawal or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance
with, Section 7.4 or Article IX, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the
parties will consult with each other before issuing any press release or making
any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public statement as may
be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the New York Stock
Exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the consent of the other parties (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

         Section 7.8. Notice of Current Events. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly notify
each other orally and in writing of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of
any event that, individually or



<PAGE>
                                                                              40


in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (ii) the failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to
the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall not cure any breach of
any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

         Section 7.9. Employee Matters.

                  (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company
         Employee employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the
         Effective Time ("Current Employee") may have under any Company Benefit
         Plan, the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the
         period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
         anniversary thereof, shall maintain for each Current Employee (i) his
         or her salary or hourly wage rate, commission structure and
         opportunities, and/or target cash bonus opportunities under annual
         programs (but, except as otherwise agreed with Parent or the Surviving
         Corporation, excluding any equity or equity equivalent award
         opportunities, and any other equity-based compensation) (collectively,
         "Compensation"), that in the aggregate are no less favorable than, and
         (ii) severance, pension and welfare benefits (excluding any value
         attributable to any equity-based benefits) provided under the Company
         Benefit Plans that in the aggregate are no less favorable than, the
         Compensation and benefits, as applicable, maintained for and provided
         to such Current Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time;
         provided, however, that subject to the foregoing and Section 7.9(c),
         nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any
         Company Benefit Plans or interfere with the Surviving Corporation's
         right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform
         with applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 7.9 shall limit the right
         of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate
         the employment of any Current Employee at any time.

                  (b) As of and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
         Corporation shall give Current Employees full credit for all purposes
         (but not benefit accruals under any newly-established defined benefit
         pension plans, except for vacation and severance, if applicable, under
         the Company Benefit Plans), under any new employee compensation and
         incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies
         and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Current Employees as of
         and after the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
         Subsidiaries for the Company Employees' service with the Company, its
         Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a "Surviving
         Corporation Plan") to the same extent recognized by the Company
         immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Surviving
         Corporation Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
         Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
         shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
         eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, for the applicable plan
         year in which the

         Closing occurs, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
         limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
         reimbursed to, Current Employees under similar plans maintained by the
         Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c) In connection with the foregoing, (i) prior to the
         Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
         eliminate any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
         make any contributions to any grantor trust maintained for the benefit
         of participants with respect to obligations under the Company
         Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP") or any other
         non-qualified retirement plan, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time,
         the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that the SERP
         shall, except as may be required by applicable Law, in no event be
         terminated, or amended in a manner that would adversely affect any of
         the participants in the SERP as of the date hereof, at least until such
         time as each such participant has become fully vested in the maximum
         benefit available to each such participant under the SERP (including
         achieving the maximum years of service under the SERP).

                  (d) At the Effective Time, each of the nine "Covered Officers"
         (as defined in the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan) who are
         participants in the Company's 2006 Senior Officer Performance
         Excellence Program (the "PEP") will be paid out in cash at the level of
         their "2006 Target" bonus amount set forth in the PEP, pursuant to the
         terms of the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company may take
         all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
         7.9(d).

                  (e) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are for the sole
         benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed
         or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to
         any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Company
         Employees), other than the parties hereto and their respective
         permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
         rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this
         Section 7.9) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

         Section 7.10. Financing. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective Representatives, including legal and
accounting, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in
a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation
of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar

private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to high yield debt
securities need not be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided further that, any such memoranda or prospectuses shall contain
disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving
Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the
obligor, (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, other
definitive financing documents, or other

certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and consents of accountants for
use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral, (iv) furnishing
Parent and its Financing sources as promptly as practicable (and in any event no

Parent, including all financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of
the type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act to consummate the offerings of debt securities contemplated
by the Debt Financing Commitments at the time during the Company's fiscal year
such offerings will be made (the "Required Financial Information"), (v) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants' comfort letters, legal opinions,
surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, (vi) providing
monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) within the time frame, and to
the extent, the Company prepares such financial statements, (vii) taking all
actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in

foregoing, (viii) entering into one or more credit or other agreements on terms
satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt Financing immediately prior
to the Effective Time; provided that, subject to taking the actions required by
clause (ix) below, the Company shall not be required to enter into any purchase
agreement for any high-yield debt financing (other than bridge financing), (ix)
taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing
and the direct borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Debt
Financing, including any high yield debt financing, by the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time, and (x) assisting Parent with any
presentation to the SEC with regard to the recording of the Merger as a
recapitalization for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP and
cooperating in good faith with Parent, if so requested by Parent, in order to
develop alternative means of recording the Merger as a recapitalization for
financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP; provided that none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not simultaneously
reimbursed by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives for and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company
or the Subsidiaries). The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely
to harm or disparage the Company or any of it Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks. All
non-public or otherwise confidential information

                                                                              43


regarding the Company obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives
pursuant to this Section 7.10(a) shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

                  (b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
         the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable taking into account the
         expected timing of the Marketing Period and the End Date on the terms
         and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments, including
         using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements
         with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein or
         on other terms no less favorable to Parent and (ii) to satisfy on a
         timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive
         agreements that are within its control. In the event that all
         conditions to the Financing Commitments (other than in connection with
         the Debt Financing, the availability or funding of any of the Equity
         Financing) have been satisfied in Parent's good faith judgment, and
         subject in the case of bridge financing to the fifth sentence of this
         Section 7.10(b), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
         the lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund the
         Financing required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date
         (including by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and other
         Persons providing such Financing to fund such Financing). In the event
         any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
         conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall
         use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative
         financing from alternative sources on terms no less favorable to Parent
         (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as
         practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than
         the final day of the Marketing Period or if, earlier, the End Date.
         Parent shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of material
         developments relating to the Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, in
         the event that (x) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured
         as high yield financing has not been consummated, (y) all closing
         conditions contained in Article VIII (other than those contained in
         Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.3(c)) shall have been satisfied or waived
         and (z) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing
         Commitments (or alternative bridge financing obtained in accordance
         with this Agreement) are available on the terms and conditions
         described in the Debt Financing Commitments (or replacements thereof),
         then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be
         used to replace such high yield financing no later than the final day
         of the Marketing Period or, if earlier, the End Date. For purposes of
         this Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of 20
         consecutive Business Days after the date hereof throughout which (A)
         Parent shall have the Required Financial Information that the Company
         is required to provide to Parent pursuant to Section 7.10(a) and (B)
         the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 shall be satisfied and nothing
         has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the
         conditions set forth in Sections8.2(a) or 8.2(b) to fail to be
         satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during
         such 20 consecutive Business Day period; provided, that if the
         Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to December 19, 2006, the
         Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than January 2, 2007; and
         provided, further, that the "Marketing Period" shall not be deemed to
         have commenced if, prior to the completion of the Marketing Period,
         Ernst &Young LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to
         any financial statements contained in the Company SEC Reports.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreements
         to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates may
         enter into discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understanding
         with respect to equity financing or equity financing commitments in
         respect of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
         Merger Agreement with any Person listed on Section 7.10(c) of the
         Company Disclosure Letter.

         Section 7.11. Actions with Respect to Existing Debt. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request by Parent to do
so, the Company shall commence offers to purchase with respect to all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of those series of the Company debt
securities listed on Schedule 7.11 (the "Short-Dated Notes"), on such terms and
conditions, including pricing terms, that are proposed, from time to time, by
Parent (each a "Debt Tender Offer" and collectively, the "Debt Tender Offers")
and Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the closing of the Debt Tender Offers shall be conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offers to close on the Closing Date. The
Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide
all cooperation requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offers.
With respect to any series of Short-Dated Notes, if requested by Parent in
writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Tender Offer for such series (or in
addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the Indenture
and the Debt Securities (as defined in the Indenture) for such Short-Dated
Notes, (A) issue not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the
Effective Time a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of Short-Dated Notes of such series pursuant to
Section 1204 of the Indenture or (B) take any actions reasonably requested by
Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and/or discharge of such series pursuant
to Section 401 or Article 14 of the Indenture, and shall redeem or satisfy
and/or discharge, as applicable, such series in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture at the Effective Time; provided that prior to the Company being
required to take any of the actions described in clause (A) or (B) above that
cannot be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing, Parent shall have, or
shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the Indenture
sufficient funds to effect such redemption or satisfaction and discharge. If
this Agreement is terminated (other than pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) or
9.1(d)) prior to the consummation of the Merger, Parent shall reimburse the
Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred pursuant to,
and in accordance with, this Section 7.11. If the Effective Time does not occur,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and directors and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against
any and all damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with any actions
taken pursuant to this Section 7.11; provided, however, that Parent shall not
have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or Person to
the extent that any such damages suffered or incurred arose from disclosure
regarding the Company that is determined to have contained a material
misstatement or omission.

         Section 7.12. Actions with Respect to Foundation Options and HTI
Warrant. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (a) the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents as are
necessary under the HTI Warrant to amend the HTI Warrant in order to provide for
the cancellation of the HTI Warrants immediately prior




<PAGE>
                                                                              45


to the Effective Time in exchange for the payment by the Surviving Corporation
to each holder thereof of cash in an amount equal to (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to the HTI Warrant held by such holder multiplied by (B)
the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price
applicable to the HTI Warrant and (b) recommend to the board of directors (or
equivalent governing body) of HCA Healthcare Foundation Inc. that the Foundation
Options be exercised prior to the Effective Time.

         Section 7.13. Insurance Matters. To the extent requested by Parent, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to purchase by the Effective Time
tail policies to the current fiduciary liability and excess hospital
professional liability polices maintained on the date hereof by the Company and
its Subsidiaries, which tail policies shall be effective for a period from the
Effective Time through a reasonable period specified by Parent and shall contain
the coverage and amount reasonably requested by Parent.

         Section 7.14. Section 16(b). The Company shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the
Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

         Section 7.15. Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, except as
otherwise may be agreed by Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of all directors of the
Company. Upon the request of Parent, as specified by Parent reasonably in
advance of the Closing, the Company will seek to obtain the resignation of all
directors of Subsidiaries of the Company, in each case, effective at the
Effective Time.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

         the HSR Act (and any extension thereof) relating to the Merger shall
         have expired or been terminated.

                  (c) No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality. No temporary
         restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
         judgment or order issued by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction
         or other Law shall be in effect which prohibits, restrains or renders
         illegal the consummation of the Merger.

         The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are
subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of the following further conditions:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and

         all material respects as of the Effective Time as if made at and as of
         such time, (ii) set forth in Section 4.6(a) shall be true and correct
         in all respects as of the Effective Time as if made at and as of such
         time, except in the case of this clause (ii) where the failure to be so

         ability to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set
         forth in the Debt Financing Commitments, (iii) set forth in Section
         4.14(b) shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the
         Effective Time as if made at and as of such time, and (iv) set forth in
         Article IV, other than those described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
         above, shall be true and correct as of the Effective Time as if made at
         and as of such time (without giving effect to any qualification as to
         "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), except in the case of
         this clause (iv) where the failure to be so true and correct,
         individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably
         be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; provided
         that representations made as of a specific date shall be required to be
         so true and correct (subject to such qualifications) as of such date
         only.

                  (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company
         shall have performed in all material respects all obligations, and

         received a certificate signed by a senior officer of the Company
         certifying as to the matters set forth in Section 8.2(a) and Section
         8.2(b).

         Section 8.3. Conditions of the Obligations of the Company. The
obligation of the Company to consummate the Merger is subject to the
satisfaction or valid waiver of the following further conditions:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
         warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that
         are qualified as to materiality shall be true and correct as of the
         Effective Time as if made at and as of such time and those which are
         not so qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects as
         of the Effective Time as if made at and as of such time, except where
         the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true would
         not prevent the consummation of the Merger; provided that
         representations made as of a specific date shall be required to be true
         as of such date only.

                  (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub.

<PAGE>
                                                                              47


         all material respects with the agreements and covenants, required to be
         performed by or complied with by it hereunder.

                  (c) Officer's Certificate. The Company shall have received a
         certificate signed by a senior officer of Parent and Merger Sub
         certifying as to the matters set forth in Section 8.3(a) and Section
         8.3(b).

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                   TERMINATION

         Section 9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding
any prior adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company):

                  (a) by mutual written consent of the Company, on the one hand,
         and Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand;

                  (b) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
         Merger Sub, on the other hand, if:

                           (i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or
                  before December 19, 2006, or if the Marketing Period has not
                  ended on or before December 19, 2006 (the "End Date"), the End
                  Date shall be extended to January 31, 2007 (and in such event
                  the term "End Date" shall mean January 31, 2007); unless the
                  failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date is the
                  result of, or caused by, the failure of the party seeking to
                  exercise such termination right to perform or observe any of
                  the covenants or agreements of such party set forth in this
                  Agreement;

                           (ii) there shall be any final and nonappealable Law
                  that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise
                  prohibited; or

                           (iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any
                  adjournment thereof at which this Agreement has been voted
                  upon, the stockholders of the Company fail to adopt this
                  Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Vote;

                  (c) by the Company:

                           (i) if a breach of any representation, warranty,
                  covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set
                  forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause
                  any of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.3(a) or (b) not
                  to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured
                  by the End Date; provided, however, that the Company is not
                  then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any
                  of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1, 8.2(a) or 8.2(b)
                  not to be satisfied;

                           (ii) prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
                  Vote, in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
                  conditions of, Section 7.4(d); or

                           (iii) if all of the conditions set forth in Sections
                  8.1, 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) have been satisfied and Parent has
                  failed to consummate the Merger no later than 5 calendar days
                  after the final day of the Marketing Period.

                  (d) by Parent or Merger Sub, if:

                           (i) a breach of any representation, warranty,
                  covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in
                  this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause any of
                  the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or (b) not to be
                  satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the
                  End Date; provided, however, that neither Parent nor Merger
                  Sub is then in material breach of this Agreement so as to
                  cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1, 8.3(a)
                  or 8.3(b) not to be satisfied; or

                           (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company or any
                  committee thereof (A) shall have effected a Recommendation
                  Withdrawal, or publicly proposed to effect a Recommendation
                  Withdrawal, (B) shall have approved or recommended to the
                  stockholders of the Company a Company Acquisition Proposal
                  other than the Merger, or shall have resolved to effect the
                  foregoing or (C) the Company fails to include the
                  Recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement.

         Section 9.2. Termination Fee. (a) In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) or by Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii), then the Company shall pay the Termination
Fee as directed in writing by Parent, at or prior to the time of termination in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) or as promptly as
possible (but in any event within two Business Days) following termination of
this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii).

                  (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent
         or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
         pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii) (or is terminated by the Company
         pursuant to a different section of Section 9.1 at a time when this
         Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii)) or by Parent
         or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i) (or is terminated by the
         Company pursuant to a different section of Section 9.1 at a time when
         this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i)) and, at
         any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company
         Stockholder Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
         9.1(b)(iii)) or prior to the breach giving rise to the right of
         termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
         9.1(d)(i)), a bona fide, written Company Acquisition Proposal involving
         the purchase of not less than a majority of the outstanding voting
         securities of the Company shall have been publicly announced or
         publicly made known and, in the case of termination pursuant to Section
         9.1(b)(iii), not publicly withdrawn at least two Business Days prior to
         the Company Stockholder Meeting, and, if within twelve months after
         such termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii) or Section 9.1(d)(i)
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
         agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Company Acquisition
         Proposal involving the purchase of not less than a majority of the
         outstanding voting securities of the Company (whether or not the same
         as that originally announced or consummated), then, on the date of such
         execution or consummation, the Company shall

                                                                              49


         pay the Termination Fee as directed in writing to Parent, less the
         amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent by the Company.

                  (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent
         or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
         pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii) (or is terminated by the Company
         pursuant to a different section of Section 9.1 at a time when this
         Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii)) or by Parent
         or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i) (or is terminated by the
         Company pursuant to a different section of Section 9.1 hereof at a time
         when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i)) under
         circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to
         this Section 9.2, then the Company shall pay as promptly as possible
         (but in any event within two Business Days) following receipt of an
         invoice therefor all of Parent's actual and reasonably documented
         out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
         expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to
         the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement ("Parent Expenses") as directed by
         Parent in writing, which amount shall not be greater than $50 million;
         provided, that the existence of circumstances which could require the
         Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant
         to Section 9.2(b) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to
         pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.2(c); and provided,
         further that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to
         this Section 9.2(c) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
         obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(b) except
         to the extent indicated in Section 9.2(b).

                  (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
         Company pursuant to (i) Section 9.1(b)(i) and at the time of such
         termination the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1, 8.2(a) and 8.2(b)
         have been satisfied, (ii) Section 9.1(c)(i) and at the time of such
         termination there is no state of facts or circumstances that would
         reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section
         8.1, 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) not to be satisfied on or prior to the End Date,
         or (iii) Section 9.1(c)(iii), then Parent shall pay the Company the
         Termination Fee as promptly as possible (but in any event within two
         Business Days) following such termination by the Company.

                  (e) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section
         9.2(a), 9.2(b) or 9.2(c) or 9.2(d) shall be paid by wire transfer of
         immediately available funds to an account designated by the party
         entitled to receive such payment.

                  (f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
         that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part
         of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without these
         agreements the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered
         into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this
         Section 9.2 do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay as
         directed in writing by Parent any amounts due to Parent or Merger Sub
         pursuant to this Section 9.2 within the time periods specified in this
         Section 9.2 or Parent fails to pay the Company any amounts due to the
         Company pursuant to this Section 9.2 within the time periods specified
         in this Section 9.2, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay
         the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
         incurred by Parent or the

                                                                              50


         Company, as applicable, in connection with any action, including the
         filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts,
         together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate
         prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal,
         calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to
         be paid until the date of actual payment. Notwithstanding anything to
         the contrary in this Agreement, the Company's right to receive payment
         of the Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to this Section 9.2 or the
         guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantees shall be the sole and
         exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent,
         Merger Sub, the Guarantors and any of their respective former, current,
         or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
         directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a
         result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment
         of such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any of
         their respective former, current, or future general or limited
         partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
         Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation
         relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement (except that Parent shall also be
         obligated with respect to the second sentence of this Section 9.2(f)
         and the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent
         contained in Sections 7.10(a) and 7.11, and that Parent and Merger Sub
         shall also be obligated with respect to the provisions of Sections
         7.3(c) and the last sentence of Section 7.10(a), it being understood
         that no other Person (including the Guarantors) shall have any
         liability or obligation under or with respect to such Sections 7.3(c)
         and such last sentence of Section 7.10(a).

         Section 9.3. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except that the
Guarantees referred to in Section 5.9, the indemnification and reimbursement
provisions of Sections 7.10(a) and 7.11, and the provisions of Section 7.3(c),
the last sentence of Section 7.10(a), Sections 9.2 and 9.3 and Article X will
survive the termination hereof; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve the Company from liabilities for Damages incurred or suffered by Parent
or Merger Sub as a result of any willful breach by the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Sections 8.1, 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) not to be satisfied.

notice to the other parties hereto. Each such notice, request or other
communication shall be effective (i) if given by telecopier, when such telecopy
is transmitted to the facsimile number specified above and electronic
confirmation of transmission is received or (ii) if given by any other means,
when delivered at the address specified in this Section 10.1.

         Section 10.2. Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein
which by their terms apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time and then
only to such extent. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and
agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth
in this Agreement (a) no party makes, and has not made, any representations or
warranties relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with
the Merger, (b) no person has been authorized by any party to make any
representation or warranty relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in
connection with the Merger and, if made, such representation or warranty must
not be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any
estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to any
party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or to
include representations or warranties unless any such materials or information
is expressly the subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement.

         Section 10.3. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in

hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors
(in the case of the Company, acting through the Special Committee if such
committee still exists) at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company;
provided, however, that, after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company, no amendment may be made which under applicable Law requires the
further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties hereto.

         Section 10.5. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the requirements of
applicable law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained for the benefit of such party contained herein; provided that for so
long as the Special Committee exists, the Company may not take any such action
unless previously authorized by the Special Committee. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any
rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

         Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other parties hereto (and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void and without effect), except that each of
Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of its rights and obligations
hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent; provided, however, that no such assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder.

         Section 10.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

         Section 10.8. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective only when actually signed by each party hereto and each
such party has received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder or with
respect hereto, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 7.5.

         Section 10.9. Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any
Law, or due to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

         Section 10.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter and
supersedes all oral or written prior or contemporaneous agreements and
understandings among the parties with respect to such subject matter.

         Section 10.11. Remedies. (a) The Company agrees that to the extent it
has incurred losses or damages in connection with this Agreement, (i) the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for such losses or damages
shall be limited to $500 million and any amounts owed pursuant to Sections
7.10(a) and 7.11, (ii) the maximum liability of each Guarantor, directly or
indirectly, shall be limited to the express obligations of such Guarantor under
its Guarantee, and (iii) in no event shall the Company seek to recover any money
damages in excess of such amount from Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors, or
their respective Representatives and Affiliates in connection therewith.

                  (b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
         occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
         performed by the Company in accordance with the terms hereof and that,
         prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1,
         Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of the
         terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The
         parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an
         injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by
         Parent or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and
         provisions of this Agreement and that the Company's sole and exclusive
         remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set forth in
         Sections 9.2(d) and 10.11(a); provided, however, that the Company shall
         be entitled to specific performance against Parent and Merger Sub to
         prevent any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of Section 7.3(c) and the
         last sentence of Section 7.10(a).

         Section 10.12. Jurisdiction.

                  (a) In any action or proceeding between any of the parties
         arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i)
         irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits, for itself and
         its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of
         Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the case of any claim as to
         which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction,
         the Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
         Delaware); (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
         proceeding must be commenced, and may be heard and determined,
         exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if
         applicable, such Federal court); (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it
         may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
         hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding
         in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and, if applicable,
         such Federal court); and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted
         by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
         action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
         (or, if applicable, such Federal court). Each of the parties hereto
         agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
         conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
         judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this
         Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
         provided for notices in Section 10.1. Nothing in this Agreement shall
         affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
         other manner permitted by law.

                  (b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
         CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY

         TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH
         PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH
         PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
         OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
         TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
         ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
         PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
         WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
         WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
         OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV)
         EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
         OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
         10.12.

         Section 10.13. Authorship. The parties agree that the terms and
language of this Agreement were the result of negotiations between the parties
and their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption
that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard
to events of authorship or negotiation.
