  |  

_Exchange of Certificates for Shares_ 

---|--- 
  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent,
with the Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
(the " **Exchange Agent** "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash and
any dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock
to be issued or paid pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.2(c) in exchange for
outstanding Shares upon due surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IV (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with the amount of any dividends or
other distributions payable with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred
to as the " **Exchange Fund** ").

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Appropriate transmittal materials shall be
provided by the Exchange Agent to holders of record of Shares as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon the surrender of a Certificate to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article IV, (y)
a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings)
of (A) the cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 4.1(a) plus (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (C) any
unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article IV, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with
a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any
other dividends or distributions in respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid
to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for shares
of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered

  



  

\- 4 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction
of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

  

For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Person** " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. (i)
All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered
for exchange in accordance with this Article IV. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at
the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment
date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but
with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

  

(ii) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to vote
after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificates,
regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.

  

(d) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
but for this Section 4.2(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in
lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and
shall represent such holders proportionate interest in a share of Parent
Common Stock based on the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on
behalf of such holder of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive. Any such sale
shall be made by the Exchange Agent within five business days after the date
upon which the Certificate(s) (or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu thereof) that
would otherwise result in the

  



  

\- 5 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

issuance of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock have been received
by the Exchange Agent.

  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any Parent Common
Stock) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any stockholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any certificates for shares of
Parent Common Stock of such stockholders and payment of any cash, dividends
and other distributions in respect thereof payable and/or issuable pursuant to
Section 4.1 and Section 4.2(c) upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavit(s) of loss in lieu thereof), in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Entity,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent
Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends and other distributions that would
be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

  

(h) _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any "affiliate" (as determined
pursuant to Section 6.8) of the Company shall not be exchanged until Parent
has received a written agreement from such Person as provided in Section 6.8.

  

4.3 _Dissenters  Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled
to shares of Parent Common Stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares or any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to this Article IV unless and until
the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Merger under the
DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the
payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by
such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to properly perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent with respect to any Shares,
such Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been
converted into shares of Parent Common Stock plus the cash amount that such
Person is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a). The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served

  



  

\- 6 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

pursuant to applicable law received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares,
offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any
such demands.

  

4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of Parent Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Mixed
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

  

4.5 _Treatment of Company Options and Awards_. (a) _Company Options_.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
Shares (a " **Company Option** ") under the Stock Plans, whether vested or
unvested and whether exercisable or not exercisable, shall be cancelled and
shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after surrender thereof, an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the number of Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the amount by which the sum of (x) $20.00 plus (y)
the Average Closing Price times 0.42 exceeds the exercise price per Share
under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. As used in this Agreement, the " **Average Closing
Price** " shall mean the average of the per share closing prices of Parent
Common Stock as reported on the NYSE composite transactions reporting system
(as reported in the New York City edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if
not reported thereby, another authoritative source) for the five trading day
period ending on the last trading day prior to the Closing Date.

  

(b) _Other Stock Based Plans and Company Awards_. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each unvested restricted stock award and each restricted
stock right award including performance-based restricted stock right awards
(collectively, the " **Company Awards** ") shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after
surrender thereof, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of
Shares subject to such unvested Company Award (assuming, for any performance-
based Company Award outstanding on or before October 1, 2005, that the
percentage base number of Shares earned under each such Company Award was
200%, and assuming, for any performance-based Company Award granted
after October 1, 2005, that the percentage base number of Shares earned under
each such Company Award was 100%) and (ii) the sum of (x) $20.00 plus (y) the
Average Closing Price times 0.42, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment.

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  



  

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, its Board of Directors and its compensation committee, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions, including adoption of any
appropriate amendments to the Stock Plans and other Company Benefit Plans
which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections 4.5(a) and (b).

  

(d) _No Right to Acquire Shares_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time (i) neither Parent
nor the Surviving Entity will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to or
in settlement of Company Options or Company Awards after the Effective Time,
and (ii) the Surviving Entity will not be bound by any options, rights, awards
or arrangements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent or Merger
Sub, to beneficially own shares of the Surviving Entity or Parent or receive
any payments (other than as set forth in this Section 4.5) in respect of such
options, rights, awards or arrangements.

  

ARTICLE V

  



  

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

  

5.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set
forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure schedule
delivered to Parent by the Company on or prior to entering into this Agreement
(the " **Company Disclosure Schedule** "), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other business entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own and operate its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other foreign
business entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or
to have such power or authority, when taken together with all other such
failures, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or
other organizational documents, each as amended to the date hereof. The
Companys and its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or
other organizational documents so delivered are in full force and effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the
provisions of its organizational documents. Section 5.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list of each jurisdiction
where the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is organized and qualified to
do business.

the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to
make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of
its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or a default under, the loss of any benefit under, the

of any party under any of the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or

have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 5.1(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of material
Contracts, including all Hydrocarbon Contracts, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which consents or waivers are or may be required

and complete list of all orders entered by the applicable United States

individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

delivered to Parent each registration statement, report, proxy statement and
information

statement prepared by it since December 31, 2004 (the " **Audit Date** "),
including (A) the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2004, and (B) the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
the periods ended March 31, 2005, and June 30, 2005, each in the form
(including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " **SEC** ") (collectively, including
any such reports filed subsequent to the date hereof and as amended, the "
**Company Reports** "). As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of
the date of such amendment) the Company Reports did not, and any Company
Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Each of
the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly
presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of income and of changes in financial position included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the results of
operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case
may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" **GAAP** ")
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be otherwise
noted therein.

  

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with (A)
the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " **Sarbanes-
Oxley Act** ") and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the NYSE. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act,
including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3) thereof, since the enactment of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has made,
arranged or modified (in any material way) personal loans to any executive
officer or director of the Company.

  

(iii) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make
the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The Company has

  



  

\- 12 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof of
internal control over financial reporting, to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (A) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made
available to Parent true and correct copies of any such disclosure made by
management to the Companys auditors and audit committee since January 1,
2003. Since January 1, 2003, no former or current employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has reported or alleged to the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company or the Companys auditors questionable
accounting or auditing practices. No attorney representing the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company.

  

(iv) The Company has not granted any waivers with respect to its
policies regarding ethical conduct.

  

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Company
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since the Audit Date the Company and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have
not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary
and usual course of such businesses and there has not been (i) any change in
the financial condition, properties, prospects, business or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any development or
combination of developments of which the Company has knowledge that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any material damage, destruction or
other casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned,
leased or otherwise used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not covered by insurance; (iii) any material acquisition or disposition of
assets by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the sale, lease,
farm-out, license or other disposition of any material properties or assets,
except for (A) sales of Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of business, (B)
dispositions of interests in exploratory prospects in exchange for interests
in other prospects from third parties which the Company in good faith believes
to have an equivalent value, consistent with past practices, and (C) sales of
equipment and/or replacements thereof in the ordinary course of business; (iv)
any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution in cash, stock or property in respect of the capital stock of the
Company, except for dividends or other distributions on its capital stock
publicly announced prior to the date hereof and except as expressly permitted
hereby; (v) any change by the Company in accounting principles, practices or
methods;

or (vi) any (A) Tax election made or changed, (B) Tax audit settled, or (C)
amended Tax Return filed, in each case, that is reasonably likely to result in
an increase to a Tax liability, which increase has had or is likely to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since the Audit Date, except as provided
for herein or as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, there has not been any increase in the compensation payable or that
could become payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to officers or
key employees or any amendment of any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans
other than increases or amendments in the ordinary course. As used in this
Agreement, the term " **knowledge** " (with respect to representations in this
Section 5.1) shall mean the actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of the
officers and employees of the Company listed on Section 5.1(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Company
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there are no (i) civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) obligations or liabilities, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed,
including those relating to matters involving any Environmental Law, or any
other facts or circumstances of which the Company has knowledge that could
result in any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, the Company or
any of its affiliates, except for those that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

_Employee Benefits and Employment Matters_. 

---|--- 
  

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
arrangements covering current or former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " **Employees** ") and current or former directors of the
Company, including the Stock Plans and "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" **ERISA** "), and deferred compensation, pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employment, termination,
severance, compensation, medical, health, employee stock ownership, stock
bonus, restricted stock, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation
rights, Company stock based, incentive and bonus plans (the " **Company
Benefit Plans** "), other than Company Benefit Plans maintained outside of the
United States primarily for the benefit of Employees working outside of the
United States (such plans hereinafter being referred to as " **Company Non
U.S. Benefit Plans**"), are listed on Schedule 5.1(h)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and each Company Benefit Plan which has received a
favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service National Office,
including any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified. True
and complete copies of all Company Benefit Plans listed on Schedule 5.1(h)(i)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including any trust instruments, insurance
contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership plan, loan
agreements forming a part of any Company Benefit Plans,

and all amendments thereto have been provided or made available to Parent.
Each Company Benefit Plan containing "change of control" or similar provisions
is specifically identified on Schedule 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

  

(ii) All Company Benefit Plans, other than Company NonU.S. Benefit
Plans, are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable
laws. Each Company Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (the " **Company
ERISA Plans** ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " **Company Pension Plan** ") and that is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " **IRS** ")
covering all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. There is no voluntary employees beneficiary association,
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, which provides benefits
under a Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Company ERISA Plan that,
assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof,
could subject the Company or any such Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount
which would be material. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred or reasonably expects to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by
Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability
under Section 4071 of ERISA.

  

(iii) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiple employer plan within the
meaning of Code section 413(c) or ERISA section 4063, 4064 or 4066 or a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each a "
**Multiemployer Plan** "). No Company Benefit Plan is a multiple employer
welfare arrangement as defined in ERISA section 3(40). Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has contributed to, or
had an obligation to contribute to, a Multiemployer Plan.

  

(iv) To the knowledge of the Company, with respect to each Company
Benefit Plan, no event has occurred, and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances, in connection with which the Company could directly or
indirectly (through a commonly controlled entity or otherwise) be subject to
any liability, other than any liability for benefits claims and funding
obligations payable in the ordinary course. To the knowledge of the Company,
the Company and each commonly controlled entity have made all payments due
from it to date with respect to each Company Benefit Plan.

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  



  

(v) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or
is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of
the Code (a " **Company ERISA Affiliate** "). The Company and its Subsidiaries
have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with
respect to a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA
(regardless of whether based on contributions of a Company ERISA Affiliate).
No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of
ERISA for which the reporting requirement has not been waived or extended,
other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" **PBGC** ")
Reg. Section 4043.33 or 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Company
Pension Plan or by any Company ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period
ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No notices have been required
to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or the PBGC under Section 302 or
4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code (including Section 412(m)). No event
has occurred, and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, which
presents a material risk that any Company Pension Plan has or is likely to
experience a partial termination within the meaning of Code section 411(d)(3).

  

(vi) All contributions required to be made under each Company Benefit
Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each Company Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected
in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by
reference in the Company Reports prior to the date hereof. Neither any Company
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no Company ERISA Affiliate
has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any
single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate has been required to file
information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most
recently completed plan year. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Company Pension Plan
or to any single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate pursuant to
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

  

(vii) No Company Pension Plan was or is subject to the provisions of
Section 302 or 4022 of ERISA or the provisions of Section 412 of the Code.

  

(viii) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company threatened, litigation relating to the Company
Benefit

Plans. There are no actions, liens, suits or claims pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened (other than routine claims for benefits)
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or against the assets of any Company
Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for retiree health and life insurance benefits under any Company
ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement (other than COBRA continuation
coverage); retiree health and life insurance benefits mean medical and life
insurance benefits provided to current or former employees beyond their
retirement or other termination of service. The Company or its Subsidiaries
may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any
liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such
amendment or termination.

  

(ix) To the knowledge of the Company, each Company Benefit Plan that is
a "group health plan" (as defined in ERISA section 607(1) or Code section
5001(b)(1)) has been operated at all times in material compliance with the
provisions of COBRA, HIPAA and any applicable, similar state law.

  

(x) Each Company Pension Plan that is not qualified under Code section
401(a) or 403(a) is exempt from Part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an
unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees, pursuant to ERISA section 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1). No
assets of the Company are allocated to or held in a "rabbi trust," "secular
trust," or similar funding vehicle.

  

(xi) There are no reserves, assets, surpluses or prepaid premiums with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

  

(xii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan which would increase materially the
expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred
therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this
Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (A) entitle any employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay
upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (B) except as
required in connection with the termination of the Companys 401(k) Plan
pursuant to the requirement of Section 6.11(a), accelerate the time of payment
or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company
Benefit Plans, (C) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent to merge, amend
or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans,

or (D) result in payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans which would
not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.

  

(xiii) As of the Closing, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any entity with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be
considered a single employer under 29 U.S.C. section 2101(a)(1) or under any
relevant case-law has incurred any liability or obligation under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as it may be amended from time to
time.

  

(xiv) To the knowledge of the Company, all Company NonU.S. Benefit Plans
comply in all material respects with applicable local law, provided that
solely for purposes of this sentence, the term "knowledge" shall mean the
actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of those individuals listed in
Section 5.1(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the General
ManagerArgentina. All Company NonU.S. Benefit Plans are listed on Schedule
5.1(h)(xiv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to any such
Company NonU.S. Benefit Plan. As of the date hereof, there is no pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened material litigation relating to
Company NonU.S. Benefit Plans.

  

(xv) As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of the Company, with
respect to Employees, there are no (i) charges of discrimination before the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Governmental Entity, (ii)
claims for unpaid wages or benefits, including overtime compensation, before
the United States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity, (iii)
claims for workers compensation or occupational disease benefits, (iv) claims
for damages, wages, or other relief to or arising from employment, termination
from employment or refusal to hire, (v) claims relating to an alleged failure
to provide any leave or notice required by the Family and Medical Leave Act,
(vi) investigations, citations or complaints by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, and (vii) claims or conciliation agreements relating
to any alleged failure to comply with Executive Order 11246 or Federal
Contract Compliance with respect to Employees, which, in the case of any of
the above clauses, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To its knowledge, the Company is (A)
in compliance with all federal and state laws respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours, and
(B) not engaged in any unfair labor or unlawful employment practice.

(m) _Taxes_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) have prepared

all Taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for which no Company Tax
Return has yet been filed. The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected on the Company Reports

Subsidiaries is liable for any Tax imposed on any entity other than such
Person, except as the result of the application of Treas. Reg. section
1.1502-6 (and any comparable provision of the tax laws of any state, local or

its Subsidiaries is or was the common parent. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or
a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying or intended to qualify for tax-

contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor

Subsidiaries the subject of any material proceeding asserting that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or is
seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization nor

there been for the past five years, any labor strike, dispute, walk-out, work
stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

(o) _Insurance_. All material property and casualty and general
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company or any of its

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

properties and assets, and are in character and amount at least equivalent to
that carried by Persons engaged in similar businesses and subject to the same
or similar perils or hazards, except for any such failures to maintain
insurance policies that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(p) _Intellectual Property_. The Company and its Subsidiaries own or
possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all patents, patent
rights, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights,
copyrights and proprietary information used or held for use in connection with
their respective businesses (" **Intellectual Property** ") as currently being
conducted, except where the failure to own or possess such licenses and other
rights does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and there are no assertions or
claims challenging the validity of any of the foregoing that are reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The conduct of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
respective businesses as currently conducted does not conflict with any
patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names,
trade name rights or copyrights of others that are reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is
no material infringement of, or challenge to, any proprietary right owned by
or licensed by or to Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

(q) _Rights Agreement_. (i) The Company has amended the Rights
Agreement to provide that Parent shall not be deemed an Acquiring Person (as

the other transactions contemplated hereby.

and Lehman Brothers Inc. as its financial advisors, the arrangements with
which have been disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof.

perfected, they have not yet become due and payable or payment is being
withheld as provided by law, or (C) if their validity is being contested in
good faith by appropriate action; (d) all rights to consent by, required
notices to, filings with, or other actions by governmental entities in
connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and gas leases or interests if
they are customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance; and (e)

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

and other payments due by the Company have been paid, there are currently
pending no written requests or demands for payments, adjustments of payments
or performance pursuant thereto; none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is in breach of any of its obligations under any Hydrocarbon
Contracts; and to the knowledge of the Company, no other party to
any Hydrocarbon Contract is in breach of any of its obligations thereunder,
except in each case, as are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All major items of operating
equipment of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in good operating condition
and in a state of reasonable maintenance and repair, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, except as are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(ii) The term " **Good and Marketable Title** " shall, for purposes of
this Section 5.1(s), with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, mean
such title that: (A) is deducible of record (from the records of the
applicable parish or county or (1) in the case of federal leases, from the
records of the applicable office of the Minerals Management Service or Bureau

unproved properties as set forth in the related Hydrocarbon Contracts; (D)
obligates the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries to pay costs and
expenses relating to each such proved property in an amount not greater than

property except as shown on the Company Reserve Reports; and (E) does not

Company Reserve Reports, which were prepared in a manner consistent with the

reasonably expected by the Company at such time to be necessary to operate and

(u) _Deliver-or-Pay Arrangements_. Except as are not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,

as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent on or
prior to entering into this Agreement (the " **Parent Disclosure Schedule**
"), Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant to the Company
that:

  

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Parent is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Merger Sub is a limited
liability company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its formation. Parent has furnished to the Company
complete and correct copies of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws
and the Certificate of Formation and Operating Agreement of Merger Sub in
effect as of the date hereof, which are in full force and effect. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or other power and authority
to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to conduct its
business as now conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as applicable,
and in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in
such good standing, or to have such power or authority when taken together
with all other such failures, is not reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

As used in this Agreement, the term " **Parent Material Adverse Effect** "
means an effect that is materially adverse to the financial condition,
properties, liabilities, prospects, business or results of operations of the
Parent and its significant subsidiaries, as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of
Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act (" **Significant
Subsidiaries** ") taken as a whole or that could reasonably be expected to

  



  

\- 29 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

materially impair the ability of the Parent to perform under this Agreement or
to consummate the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such effect
resulting from any change in economic or business conditions generally or in
the oil and gas exploration, development and/or production industries
specifically, shall not be considered when determining if a Parent Material
Adverse Effect has occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that such state of
facts, circumstance, event or change does not (x) primarily relate to (or have
the effect of primarily relating to) Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries
or (y) disproportionately adversely affect Parent and its Significant
Subsidiaries compared to other companies of similar size operating in the oil
and gas exploration, development and production industries.

  

(b) _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital of Merger
Sub consists of 100% capital interests, all of which, as of the date hereof,
are issued and outstanding and held of record by Parent. All outstanding
capital interests of Merger Sub have been duly authorized and validly issued.
All outstanding capital interests of Merger Sub have been issued and granted
in all material respects in compliance with applicable securities laws and
other requirements of law.

  

(c) _Capital Structure of Parent_. The authorized capital stock of
Parent consists of 500,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, of which
402,034,877 shares were outstanding as of the close of business on September
30, 2005, and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock having a par value $1.00
per share (the " **Parent Preferred Shares** "), of which zero shares are
outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Parent has no Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Shares
reserved for issuance, except that, as of September 30, 2005, 2,703,923 shares
of Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to Parents 1995
Incentive Stock Plan, 80,107 shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for
issuance pursuant to Parents 1996 Restricted Stock Plan, 11,436,492 shares of

Compensation Plan, 17,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for
issuance pursuant to Parents 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan; 1,183,628 shares
of Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance under Parents dividend
reinvestment plan; and 1,497,689 shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for
issuance pursuant to Parents 401(k) plan (" **Parent s 401(k) Plan**")
(together, the " **Parent Stock Plans** "). Each of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each of Parents Significant Subsidiaries is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by Parent or by a
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of any
Lien. Except as set forth above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other
securities of Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any securities
or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities

_Corporate Authority_. 

---|--- 
  

(i) No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is necessary to
approve this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or company
power and authority and has taken all corporate or other action necessary in
order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Merger. This Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will have taken all necessary
action to permit it to issue the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
required to be issued pursuant to Article IV. The Parent Common Stock, when
issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no
stockholder of Parent or other Person will have any preemptive right of
subscription or purchase in respect thereof. The Parent Common Stock, when
issued, will be registered under the Securities Act and Exchange Act and
registered or exempt from registration under any applicable state securities
or "blue sky" laws.

  

(e) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_. (i) Other than the filings
and/or notices (A) pursuant to Section 1.3, (B) under the HSR Act, the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (C) required to be made with the NYSE,
and (D) other foreign approvals, state securities, takeover and "blue sky"
laws, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by Parent
or Merger Sub with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from, any
Governmental Entity, in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those
that the failure to make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute
or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of Parent and Certificate of Formation and
Operating Agreement of Merger Sub or the comparable governing instruments of
any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, a
termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the loss of any
benefit under, the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien
on the assets of Parent or

  



  

\- 31 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

any of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
pursuant to, any Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Laws or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or (C) any change in the rights or
obligations of any party under any of the Contracts, except, in the case of
clause (B) or (C) above, for breach, violation, termination, default,
acceleration or creation that, individually or in the aggregate, is not
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(f) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_. Parent has delivered to
the Company each registration statement, report, proxy statement and
information statement prepared by it since December 31, 2004 (the " **Parent
Audit Date** "), including (i) Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the

(including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC
(collectively, including any such reports filed subsequent to the date hereof,
the " **Parent Reports** "). As of their respective dates (or if amended,
as of the date of such amendment), the Parent Reports did not, and any Parent
Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Each of
the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly
presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of income and of changes in financial position included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the results of
operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case
may be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year end audit
adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as may be otherwise noted therein.

  

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Parent
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since the Parent Audit Date, Parent
and its Significant Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses
only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than according
to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there has not been
any change in the financial condition, properties, prospects, business or
results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries or any development or
combination of developments of which management of Parent has knowledge that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to result in
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(h) _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor any of its officers,
directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or

or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal,

complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) at any time prior, but not after,
this Agreement is submitted for a vote at the Stockholders Meeting, (A)

their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law and (y) in each case
referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company

and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and
if consummated, is reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable
to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2
and in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company agrees that it will notify
Parent immediately if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by,
any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its
representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, on the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions
or negotiations. The Company also agrees that it will promptly request each
Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its Subsidiaries to return

in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
(including the proxy statement and prospectus (the " **Prospectus/ Proxy
Statement** ") constituting a part thereof) (the " **S-4 Registration
Statement** ") as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company each shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, and promptly thereafter mail the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to
the stockholders of the Company. Parent shall also use its reasonable best
efforts to satisfy prior to the effective date of the S-4 Registration
Statement all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" notice
requirements in connection with the Merger and to consummate the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will pay all expenses incident
thereto.

  

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or
its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders of the
Company to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company and
Parent will cause the Form S-4 to comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

  

6.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable law and its certificate and by-laws, all action necessary to
convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " **Stockholders Meeting** ") as
promptly as practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement is declared
effective to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to
fiduciary obligations under applicable law, the Companys Board of Directors
shall recommend such adoption and shall take all lawful action to solicit such
approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligation of the Company to convene a Stockholders Meeting shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to it, or by any
change of recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors. The Company
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or
propose to do so.

  

6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) The Company and Parent
each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the

date on which the S-4 Registration

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

Statement shall become effective and addressed to the other party and its
directors, in form and substance customary for "comfort" letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
similar to the S-4 Registration Statement.

  

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to
effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as
promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require,
Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell or hold separate and agree to sell,
before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any
assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by the Company of
any of its assets or businesses) or to agree to any material changes or
restriction in the operations of any such assets or businesses. Subject to
applicable laws relating to the sharing of information, Parent and the Company
shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each
will consult the other on, all the information relating to Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that
appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

  

(c) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement or any other statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(d) Subject to applicable law and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or
any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or

  



  

\- 38 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and
Parent each shall give prompt notice to the other of any change that is
reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, respectively.

  

6.6 _Taxation_. Subject to Section 6.2, neither Parent nor the Company
shall take or cause to be taken any action, whether before or after the
Effective Time, that would disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

6.7 _Access_. Subject to applicable law relating to the sharing of
information, upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required
by applicable law, each party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford the other partys officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized representatives (" **Representatives** ") reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to
its properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, such
party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the
other party all information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to
this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by such party, and provided, further, that the foregoing shall
not require such party (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of such party, would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if such party shall have used
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of
such party or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be directed to an executive officer of the
Company or such Person as may be designated by either of their executive
officers, as the case may be. All such information shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

6.8 _Affiliates_. Prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting,
Parent shall deliver to the Company a list of names and addresses of those
Persons who are, in the opinion of the Parent, as of the time of the
Stockholders Meeting referred to in Section 6.4, affiliates of the Company,
within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (" **affiliates** ").
The Company shall provide to Parent such information and documents as Parent
shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. There shall be
added to such list the names and addresses of any other Person subsequently
identified by either Parent or the Company as a Person who may be deemed to be
such an affiliate of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Person
identified by Parent shall be added to the list of affiliates of the Company
if Parent shall receive from the Company, on or before the date of the
Stockholders Meeting, an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent
to the effect that such Person is not such an affiliate. The Company shall
exercise its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to
Parent, prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, from each affiliate of
the Company identified in the foregoing list (as the same may be supplemented
as aforesaid), a letter dated as of the

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

Closing Date substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "
**Affiliates Letter** "). Parent shall not be required to maintain the
effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement or any other registration
statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Parent Common
Stock by such affiliates received in the Merger and Parent may direct the
Exchange Agent not to issue certificates representing Parent Common Stock
received by any such affiliate until Parent has received from such Person an
Affiliates Letter. Parent may issue certificates representing Parent Common
Stock received by such affiliates bearing a customary legend regarding
applicable Securities Act restrictions and the provisions of this Section 6.8.

  

6.9 _Stock Exchange Listing and De-listing_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date. The Surviving Entity
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shares to be de-listed from
the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

  

6.10 _Publicity_. The Company and Parent each shall consult with each
other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange) with respect thereto, except as may be required by law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or by the request of any Government Entity.

  

6.11 _Employee Benefits - General._ Parent agrees that, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Employees who are
eligible to participate in Company Benefit Plans and who are employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time ("Continuing
Employees") will be eligible to participate in employee benefit plans of
Parent or its Subsidiaries on substantially the same terms and conditions as
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, taking into
account, as of the Effective Time, the service by Continuing Employees prior
to the Effective Time described in the next following sentence. Except as set
forth in Section 6.11 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent will cause any
employee benefit plans in which the Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate to take into account, for purposes of eligibility and vesting
thereunder, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, not for purposes of
qualifying for any subsidized early retirement benefits, and not to the extent
that it would result in any duplication of benefits, service by Continuing
Employees prior to the Effective Time as if such service were with Parent, to
the same extent such service was credited under a Company Benefit Plan. Parent
shall credit any vacation balances existing at the Effective Time for each
Continuing Employee; provided, that any amount of vacation accrued under
Parents policy by reason of such Continuing Employees post-Closing service
with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be adjusted to the extent
necessary so that in no event will the aggregate amount of vacation accrued by
such Continuing Employee for the year in which the Closing occurs for pre-
Closing service

  



  

\- 40 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

with the Company and its Subsidiaries plus post-Closing service with Parent
and its Subsidiaries exceed the amount of vacation such Continuing Employee
would have accrued for that year under Parents vacation policy had such
Continuing Employee been employed only by Parent for the entire year. For
Continuing Employees, under the medical plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries
for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, (i) Parent shall cause
there to be waived any pre-existing conditions, actively at work requirements
and waiting periods or other eligibility requirements; and (ii) to the extent
that any such Continuing Employee has satisfied, in whole or in part, any
annual deductible under a Company medical plan, or has paid any out of pocket
expenses pursuant to any such plans coinsurance provision, in each case, with
respect to the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, such amount shall
be counted toward the satisfaction of any applicable deductible or out of
pocket expense maximum, respectively, under Parents medical plans. Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, honor all employee benefit
obligations to Employees receiving disability payments or on disability status
or with outstanding balances or claims, as applicable, at the Effective Time
under the Company Group Health and Lower Tax Plan and the Company Group Life
and Disability Plan (both of which are listed in Section 5.1(h)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule).

  

(a) _401(k) Plan_. Each Continuing Employee who is eligible to
participate in the Vintage Petroleum, Inc. 401(k) plan (the " **Company s
401(k) Plan**") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be eligible to
participate in Parents 401(k) Plan after the Effective Time. The Company
shall cause the Companys 401(k) Plan to be terminated effective not later
than the Closing Date and shall apply to the IRS for a favorable determination
letter regarding the qualification of the Companys 401(k) Plan upon
termination. Following Parents receipt of a copy of such a favorable
determination letter, Parent will cause Parents 401(k) Plan to permit each
Continuing Employee, at his or her option, to roll over to Parents 401(k)
Plan a distribution of his or her account balances from the Companys 401(k)
Plan (including cash and any outstanding loan balances, but excluding
rollovers in kind) under the terms and conditions established by Parents
401(k) Plan. Except as set forth in Section 6.11 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, Parent will cause Parents 401(k) Plan in which Continuing Employees
are eligible to participate to take into account, for purposes of eligibility
and vesting thereunder, but not to the extent that it would result in any
duplication of benefits, service by Continuing Employees before the Closing
Date as if such service had been with Parent, to the same extent such service
was credited under the Companys 401(k) Plan.

  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall obligate Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their
affiliates to (i) maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan or (ii)
employ or retain the employment of any particular employee.

  

(c) _Access to Employees_. From the date following the date hereof
that is mutually agreed upon between the parties (which shall not be later
than 30 days following the date hereof), the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in permitting Parent

  



  

\- 41 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

reasonable access to Employees (i) to interview during normal business hours,
(ii) to seek consent from any Employees to perform background checks and drug
testing, consistent with Parent\'s policies and (iii) to communicate to
Employees any information concerning employment with Parent or its
Subsidiaries in accordance with this Agreement. Not later than five business
days after the date hereof, the Company shall make available to Parent a list
of all Employees, including, for each Employee, the Employees name, title,
salary, work location, status (active, on leave, etc.), date of birth,
"exempt" or "non-exempt" status, and full or part time status.

  

6.12 _Expenses_. The Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the
Surviving Entity for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 8.5(b), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with the
filing fee for the S-4 Registration Statement and printing and mailing the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement shall be shared
equally by Parent and the Company.

  

6.13 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) Parent
agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, it will indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company (when
acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "
**Indemnified Parties** "), against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " **Costs** ") incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under Delaware law and its certificate of incorporation or by-
laws or pursuant to other agreements in effect on the date hereof to indemnify
such Person (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, provided the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification);
and provided further, that any determination required to be made with respect
to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set
forth under Delaware law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and
by-laws shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Entity.

  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.13, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall have the right to assume the

  



  

\- 42 -

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for
any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent; and provided further, that Parent shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

  

(c) The Surviving Entity shall maintain the Companys existing
officers and directors liability insurance (" **D andO Insurance**") for a
period of six years after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium
therefor (on an annualized basis) is not in excess of 2.0 times the last
annual premium paid prior to the date hereof (the " **Current Premium** ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the existing DandO Insurance expires, is
terminated or cancelled during such six-year period, the Surviving Entity will
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be
obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an
annualized basis) of 2.0 times the Current Premium.

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.13 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

necessary or appropriate in order for the Surviving Entity to succeed to,
assume or modify, as the case may be, the indentures governing the outstanding
publicly held debt securities of the Company referred to in the Company
Reports in order to avoid defaults thereunder as a result of the consummation
of the Merger.

  

(b) _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and its Board of Directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

either Shares or Parent Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of any

Exchange Act to exempt (i) the conversion of Shares into Parent Common Stock
and (ii) the cancellation of Company Options and Company Awards for cash
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and directors of the
Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act or by employees of the Company who may become an officer or director of
Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Board
of Directors of the Company shall adopt resolutions that specify (A) the name
of each individual whose disposition of Shares (including Company Options and
Company Awards) is to be exempted, (B) the number of Shares (including Company
Options and Company Awards) to be disposed of by each such individual, and (C)
that the approval is granted for purposes of exempting the disposition from
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3(e) of the Exchange Act.
Parent and the Company shall provide to counsel of the other party for its
review copies of such resolutions to be adopted by the respective Boards of
Directors prior to such adoption and the Company shall provide Parent with
such information as shall be reasonably necessary for Parents Board of
Directors to set forth the information required in the resolutions of Parents
Board of Directors.

shall not have been held by the Termination Date or the approval of the
Companys stockholders required by Section 7.1(a) shall not have been obtained
at the Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.2(ii) shall not be available to the Company where the failure to
obtain Company stockholder approval shall have been caused by the action or
failure to act by the Company and such action or failure to act constitutes a
material breach by the Company of this Agreement; or (iii) any Order
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of
the Merger shall become final and non-appealable (whether before or after the

terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (i) above shall not be available
to any party that has breached in any material respect its obligations under
this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately contributed to the
occurrence of the failure of the Merger to be consummated.

  

8.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the approval by stockholders of the Company referred to in
Section 7.1(a), by action of the Board of Directors of the Company, if there

8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) In the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to
this Article VIII, this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 9.1)
shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and
financial advisors or other representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , except
as otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful or intentional
breach of this Agreement.

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.4(i) or Section 8.4(iii) other than a failure to obtain the
consent of the Companys stockholders, then the Company shall promptly, but in
no event later than two days after the date of such termination, pay Parent a
termination fee of $75,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds
(the " **Termination Fee** "). The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and
Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and, in

 **EXHIBIT A**

  



  

Occidental Petroleum Corporation

  

10889 Wilshire Boulevard

  

Los Angeles, California 90024

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "
_affiliate_ " of Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (the "Company"), as the term
"affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145
("Rule 145") of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act").

  



  

I have been further advised that, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of October 13, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and
among the Company, Occidental Petroleum Corporation ("Parent") and Occidental
Transaction 1, LLC ("Merger Sub"), the Company will be merged with and into
Merger Sub (the "Merger"), and I may be eligible to receive shares of common
stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") in exchange in part for shares of
common stock of the Company owned by me.

  



  

I hereby represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that, in the event I
receive any Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger:

  



  

1. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

  



  

2. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or with counsel for the Company.

  



  

3. I have been advised that any issuance of Parent Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be registered with the SEC on a registration statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger is submitted to the stockholders of the Company for approval, I may be an "affiliate" of the Company, any sale or disposition by me of any of the Parent Common Stock may only be made, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Act, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or pursuant to an exemption thereunder. I agree that I will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act; (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the applicable volume and other limitations of Rule 144 promulgated by the SEC under the Act; or (iii) in the written opinion of counsel, which 

  



  

LA_LAN01:179306.23

  



  

   



  

opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale,
transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the
Act.

  



  

4\. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common Stock by me or on my
behalf or to take any other action necessary to make compliance with an
exemption from registration available.

  



  

5\. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Parents transfer agent with respect to Parent Common Stock and that there
will be placed on the certificates for the Parent Common Stock issued to me,
or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

  



  

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The
shares represented by this certificate may only be sold or otherwise
transferred in accordance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a
registration statement under said act or an exemption from such registration."

  



  

6\. I also understand that, unless the transfer by me of my Parent
Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity
with the provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the
following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

  



  

"The sale of the shares represented by this certificate has not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), and the shares were acquired from a person who received such shares in
a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act applies.
The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in
accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act."

  



  

It is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force or effect and the legends set forth in paragraphs (5) or
(6), as the case may be, above shall be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend, and the related stop transfer restrictions
shall be lifted forthwith, if (i) any such shares of Parent Common Stock shall
have been registered under the Act for sale, transfer or other disposition by
me or on my behalf and are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or (ii)
any such shares of Parent Common Stock are sold in accordance with the
provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), (f) and (g) of Rule 144 promulgated under
the Act, or (iii) I am not at the time an affiliate of Parent and have been
the beneficial owner of the Parent Common Stock for at least one year (or such
other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations),
and Parent has filed with the SEC all of the reports it is required to file
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the preceding 12
months, other than Form 8-K reports, or (iv) I am not and have not been for at
least three months an affiliate of Parent and have been the beneficial owner
of the Parent Common Stock for at least two years (or such other period as may
be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations), or (v) Parent shall
have received a letter from the staff of the SEC, or
