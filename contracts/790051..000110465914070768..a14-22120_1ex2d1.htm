(k) subject to and in accordance with, in each case, the terms, conditions and

Gracos and each Asset Selling Subsidiarys Liabilities under Section 8.3(b)
or (c) of the ITW Purchase Agreement to indemnify the ITW Purchase Agreement

harmless from, any and all ITW Purchase Agreement Damages that are incurred by

to the extent such ITW Purchase Agreement Damages arise from or relate to

Graco believes that certain of the Liabilities described in this _Section
2.4_ also constitute Excluded Liabilities under and as defined in the ITW

Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed to suggest that such
Liabilities are not Excluded Liabilities under and as defined in the ITW
Purchase Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
PURCHASE PRICE**

 



 

3.1. _Purchase Price and Initial Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) The purchase price for the Acquired Assets is (i) Five Hundred Ninety
Million Dollars ($590,000,000.00) (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ "), (ii)
_plus_ any Cash and Cash Equivalents (as determined following the Closing
pursuant to _Section 3.2_), (iii) _minus_ any Debt of any Asset Selling
Subsidiary (to the extent constituting Assumed Liabilities) as of the Closing
Date and any Debt of any Acquired Subsidiary as of the Closing Date (as
determined following the Closing pursuant to _Section 3.2_), (iv) _plus_ the
amount (if any) by which the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (as
determined following the Closing pursuant to _Section 3.2_) exceeds Fifty-
Three Million One Hundred Thirty-Nine Thousand Dollars ($53,139,000) (the "
_Upper Net Working Capital Target Amount_ ") or _minus_ the amount (if any) by
which the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (as determined following
the Closing pursuant to _Section 3.2_) is less than Fifty-One Million One
Hundred Thirty-Nine Thousand Dollars ($51,139,000) (the " _Lower Net Working
Capital Target Amount_ ") (the Initial Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to
the foregoing _clauses (ii)_ - _(iv)_ , being the " _Purchase Price_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (as determined following the Closing pursuant to _Section 3.2_)
is equal to the Lower Net Working Capital Target Amount, or is equal to the
Upper Net Working Capital Target Amount or is greater than the Lower Net
Working Capital Target Amount and less than the Upper Net Working Capital
Target Amount, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price based upon
the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date. For the further avoidance of
doubt, the Purchase Price shall not be subject any adjustment for the amount
of any Debt-Like Liabilities.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser Parent shall pay to Graco, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account or bank accounts designated in
writing by Graco no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, an amount equal to the Initial Purchase Price.

 



 

3.2. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent shall prepare and
deliver to Graco: (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Liquid
Finishing Business (the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as of and at the
Effective Time on the Closing Date (but before giving effect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), prepared in
good faith in accordance with the policies used in deriving the Audited Annual
Financial Statements (other than the departures from such policies as are
described on _Schedule 3.2(a)_) consistently applied in accordance with past
practice (except that, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Assets and
Excluded Liabilities shall be excluded from such balance sheet), and (ii) an
accompanying statement substantially in the form used in preparing the example
calculation set forth on _Schedule 3.2(a)_ (the " _Final Closing Statement_
") showing Purchaser Parents calculation, as of the Closing Date, of: (1) Net
Working Capital, Cash and

 



      
 

 



 

Cash Equivalents, any Debt of the Asset Selling Subsidiaries (to the extent
constituting Assumed Liabilities) and any Debt of any Acquired Subsidiaries,
each based upon the Final Closing Balance Sheet and calculated in accordance
with the methodologies used to prepare _Schedule 3.2(a)_ ; (2) the resulting
final Purchase Price (as determined in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_)
based on the foregoing amounts shown on the Final Closing Statement; and (3)
the Final Adjustment Amount due to Graco or Purchaser Parent (if any), such "
_Final Adjustment Amount_ " being the difference between the Initial Purchase
Price and the final Purchase Price shown on the Final Closing Statement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Final Adjustment Amount shall be due to Graco if
the Initial Purchase Price is less than the final Purchase Price shown on the
Closing Statement, and the Final Adjustment Amount shall be due to Purchaser
Parent if the Initial Purchase Price is greater than the final Purchase Price
shown on the Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) Graco may dispute Purchaser Parents calculation of the Final Closing
Balance Sheet or the Final Closing Statement (collectively, the " _Final
Closing Documents_ ") (or any element thereof) by notifying Purchaser Parent
in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), within 30 days after Gracos
receipt of the Final Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that Graco does not
deliver a Notice of Objection to Purchaser Parent within such 30 day period,
Graco shall be deemed to have accepted Purchaser Parents calculation of the
Final Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final Closing Documents. In the event
that a Notice of Objection is timely delivered, Purchaser Parent and Graco
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts and exchange any
information reasonably requested by the other party for a period of 30 days
after Purchaser Parents receipt of the Notice of Objection, or such longer
period as Graco and Purchaser Parent may agree in writing, to resolve any
disagreements set forth in the Notice of Objection. If Purchaser Parent and
Graco are unable to resolve such disagreements within such 30-day period and
if (x) the items that remain in dispute at the end of such period (the "
_Unresolved Items_ ") total less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000.00), then the Unresolved Items shall be deemed to have been resolved
by Graco and Purchaser Parent by splitting equally the amount of such
Unresolved Items, and the calculations of the Final Closing Documents shall be
finally modified so as to reflect such resolution of the Unresolved Items; or
(y) the Unresolved Items total at least One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000.00), then, within 30 days thereafter, either Graco or Purchaser
Parent may require that an independent accounting firm of recognized national
standing as may be mutually selected by Purchaser Parent and Graco (the "
_Independent Firm_ ") shall resolve the Unresolved Items; _provided_ that if
Graco and Purchaser Parent are unable to agree on an Independent Firm, the
parties agree that the Chicago, Illinois office of RSM McGladrey shall serve
as the Independent Firm. Purchaser Parent and Graco shall instruct the
Independent Firm to determine as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within 30 days after the date on which such dispute is referred to the
Independent Firm, based solely on the provisions of this Agreement, and the
written presentations by Graco and Purchaser Parent, and not on an independent
review, whether and to what extent (if any) the calculations of Final Closing
Documents require adjustment; _provided, however_ , that in resolving any
Unresolved Item, the Independent Firm (A) may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by Graco or Purchaser
Parent or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by Graco or
Purchaser Parent, (B) may not take oral testimony from the parties hereto or
any other Person, and (C) shall not consider any facts that have occurred
after the Closing Date. Graco and Purchaser Parent shall give each other
copies of any written submissions at the same time as they are submitted to
the Independent Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent

 



      
 

 



 

Firm shall be allocated between Graco and Purchaser Parent based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each of
Graco and Purchaser Parent bears to the amount actually contested by each of
Graco and Purchaser Parent. The determination of the Independent Firm shall be
set forth in a written statement delivered to Graco and Purchaser Parent and
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties, absent fraud or
manifest error.

 



 

(c) If, following completion of the procedures described in _Sections 3.2(a)_
and _(b)_ , the Final Closing Statement shows that an amount is due Purchaser
Parent (because the Initial Purchase Price is greater than the final Purchase
Price shown on the Final Closing Statement), Graco shall promptly pay such
difference to Purchaser Parent, in cash. If the Final Closing Statement shows
that an amount is due Graco (because the Initial Purchase Price is less than
the final Purchase Price shown on the Final Closing Statement), Purchaser
Parent shall promptly pay such excess to Graco, in cash.

 



 

(d) Capitalized terms used in this _Section 3.2_, but not defined herein
shall be as defined or used in _Schedule 3.2(a)_.

 



 

3.3. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser will
(and will cause Purchasers and Purchaser Parents and US Purchasers
respective Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiaries following the
Closing) to) and Graco will (and will cause Sellers and Gracos Affiliates to)
allocate the Purchase Price substantially in accordance with _Schedule 3.3_
and Applicable Law. Graco shall prepare the final allocation of the Purchase
Price consistent with _Schedule 3.3_ , and such final allocation, as prepared
by Graco, shall be binding on Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser and Purchasers
(such final allocation of the Purchase Price, as prepared by Graco in
accordance with the foregoing, being the " _Final Allocation_ "). Following
the Closing, Purchaser Parent and Graco will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates (including Purchasers, the Acquired Subsidiaries and Sellers, as
applicable) to, make consistent use of the Final Allocation as adjusted to
reflect any adjustment pursuant to _Section 3.2_, if any. With respect to the
Final Allocation, each of Purchaser Parent, Purchasers, and Sellers (1) will
be bound by the Final Allocation, (2) will (and will cause its respective
Affiliates to) act in accordance with the Final Allocation in the preparation
of all financial statements and the filing of all Tax Returns and in the
course of any Tax audit, Tax review or other Tax proceeding relating thereto,
(3) will (and will cause its respective Affiliates to) take no position
inconsistent with the Final Allocation for Tax purposes (including in
connection with any proceeding), unless in each case otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of section 1313(a) of the
Code, and (4) not later than 30 days before the filing of its IRS Forms 8594
(whether initial or supplemental) relating to the transactions contemplated
herein, will deliver to each other a true, correct and complete copy of such
IRS Forms.

 



 

3.4. _Bulk Sales Compliance_. Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser, for
themselves and on behalf of Purchasers, hereby waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, compliance by Sellers with the provisions of all
laws based on the Uniform Commercial Code relating to bulk transfers (the "
_Bulk-Transfer Laws_ ") in connection with the sale of the Acquired Assets.

under a Real Property Lease being " _Leased Real Property_"), indicates the
Asset Selling Subsidiary or Acquired Subsidiary that is the tenant or holds
the future right to occupy under such Real Property Lease, and indicates
whether such Leased Real Property is used in the Powder Finishing Business.
The Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property are collectively referred
to herein as the " _Real Property_."

 



 

(b) All of the land, buildings, structures and other improvements used by any
Asset Selling Subsidiary or any Acquired Subsidiary in the conduct of the

Subsidiary nor any Acquired Subsidiary is in default or otherwise in breach
under any Real Property Lease and, to Sellers Knowledge, no other party is in
default or otherwise in breach thereof, except where such default or breach
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. No Asset Selling Subsidiary, no

any termination right with respect to any Real Property Lease. Graco has
provided to Purchaser Parent a true, correct and complete copy of each Real

Knowledge, there are no other agreements, whether oral or written, between
such parties. All rent and other sums and charges payable by any Asset Selling
Subsidiary or any Acquired Subsidiary as tenant under any Real Property Lease
are current. No Asset Selling Subsidiary, no Acquired Subsidiary has and, to
Sellers Knowledge, no other party has repudiated any provision of any Real
Property Lease, and there is no dispute, oral agreement or forbearance program
in effect with respect to any Real Property Lease. The applicable Asset
Selling Subsidiary or Acquired Subsidiary has good title to the leasehold
estate and other rights of the tenant with respect to the property affected by
each Real Property Lease, free and clear of all Liens, except any (i)
Permitted Liens, or (ii) Liens on the applicable fee title, the payment or
performance of which is not the responsibility of any Asset Selling Subsidiary
or any Acquired Subsidiary as tenant under the applicable Real Property Lease.
No Asset Selling Subsidiary nor any Acquired Subsidiary has received written
or, to Sellers Knowledge, oral notice from any insurance company that such
insurance company will require any alteration to any Leased Real Property for
continuance of a policy insuring such property or the maintenance of any rate

Asset Selling Subsidiary or any Acquired Subsidiary under the applicable Real
Property Lease.

building affected by, any Real Property Lease that is not contained within
such Real Property Lease; and (ii) no Asset Selling Subsidiary nor any
Acquired Subsidiary has exercised any option or right to terminate, renew or
extend or otherwise affect any right or obligation of the tenant under any
Real Property Lease or to purchase the real property subject to any Real
Property Lease.

 



 

(e) Each Asset Selling Subsidiary and Acquired Subsidiary has good, marketable
and valid fee title to its respective Owned Real Property, free and clear of

to any Owned Real Property for continuance of a policy insuring any Owned Real
Property or the maintenance of any rate with respect thereto (other than any
notice of alteration that has been completed).

 



 

(f) There is no development agreement or other Contract that limits the
ability to protest any real property Tax, fix any minimum real property Tax or
require any continued business operation with respect to any Owned Real
Property or, to Sellers Knowledge, any Leased Real Property. The use and
occupancy of all Owned Real Property and, to Sellers Knowledge, all Leased
Real Property, are in material compliance with all Applicable Laws and all
applicable insurance requirements, including those pertaining to zoning
matters and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and conform to all such
Applicable Laws on a current basis without reliance on any variance or other
special limitation or conditional or special use permit.

 



 

(g) No portion of any Owned Real Property relies on any facility (other than a
facility of a public utility or community water and sewer company) not located
on such Owned Real Property to fulfill any zoning, building code or other
requirement under Applicable Law, except where such reliance would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. To Sellers Knowledge,

 



      
 

 



 

there is no material defect in any structural component of any improvement on
any Real Property or any of the electrical, plumbing, HVAC, life safety or
other building systems of any Real Property.

Liquid Finishing Business, or challenging the ownership, use, validity or
enforceability of any Business Intellectual Property or (b) contesting the
right of any Asset Selling Subsidiary or any Acquired Subsidiary to use, sell,

Asset Selling Subsidiary or any Acquired Subsidiary owns, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, any Intellectual Property rights which any

conduct of the Liquid Finishing Business. Each Asset Selling Subsidiary (with
respect to the Liquid Finishing Business) and Acquired Subsidiary employs a
process to obtain all rights to Intellectual Property created by employees and
consultants and to ensure the protection of confidential or proprietary
information. During the period after the date hereof and prior to the Closing

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not breach or otherwise
cause any violation of any Applicable Laws relating to privacy or any privacy
policies or procedures of any Asset Selling Subsidiary or any Acquired
Subsidiary.

against the interest of the Liquid Finishing Business, the Sellers or any
Acquired Subsidiary to any third Person; (ii) no disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any contract, laws
or order shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach

are incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Schedules as though fully
set forth therein, if (and only if) Graco has provided or made available true,
correct, and complete (in all material respects) copies of such documents and
contracts (except those listed on Schedule 4.10(b)) to Purchaser Parent or its
representatives prior to the date of this Agreement (or, in the event of a
Disclosure Schedule Update described in _Section 6.1(k)(ii)_ or an update,
supplement or amendment described in _Section 6.1(k)(iii)_ below,
concurrently with the delivery thereof); (iv) to the extent an item is
disclosed therein with respect to a particular Section (or sub-section) of
this Agreement, the applicable portions of such Section (or sub-section)
herein shall be deemed to be modified by such disclosure, regardless of
whether such Section (or sub-section) specifically refers to a Disclosure
Schedule; (v) disclosure of any fact or item in any Disclosure Schedule shall
not necessarily mean that such fact or item is material to the Liquid
Finishing Business; and (vi) any item or matter disclosed on any Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for all purposes on all other
Disclosure Schedules to the extent the applicability of such item or matter is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 



 

(ii) At any time and from time to time prior to the Closing, Graco and Graco
US Finishing Brands shall be entitled to: (x) update, supplement and amend any
Incomplete Disclosure Schedule to correct or complete any information that, as
of the date hereof, is inaccurate or incomplete in light of the disclosures
called for by the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement;
and (y) update, supplement and amend the Disclosure Schedules to include one
or more new schedules in the Disclosure Schedules to modify any Unqualified
Representation that, as of the date hereof, is inaccurate or incomplete (each
such update, supplement or amendment described in the foregoing _clauses (x)_
and _(y)_ being a " _Disclosure Schedule Update_ "). Each Disclosure Schedule
Update shall be deemed to update, supplement and amend the Disclosure
Schedule(s) to which each such Disclosure Schedule Update relates (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Disclosure Schedule Update made
pursuant to _clause (y)_ above, shall also be deemed to add a new schedule to
the Disclosure Schedules) for all purposes of this Agreement (including, but
not limited to, for purposes of satisfying the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Section 7.1_), and any and all Disclosure Schedule Updates shall be
deemed to cure any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties made by Graco or Graco US Finishing Brands that are subject to or
qualified by such Disclosure Schedule Updates, but only to the extent of the
information included in such Disclosure Schedule Updates. Accordingly,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (A) in
no event shall any Purchaser or member of the Purchaser Group be entitled to
seek indemnification under _Article 8_ for any Damages arising out of any
event, circumstance or change that first arose prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement to the extent such event, circumstance or change is
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules, taking into account all Disclosure
Schedule Updates; (B) in no event shall Purchaser Parent or any Purchaser be
entitled to terminate this Agreement due to any update, supplement or
amendment contained in a Disclosure Schedule Update, any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Graco or Graco US
Finishing Brands in this Agreement that is subject to or qualified by one or
more Incomplete Disclosure Schedules, or any breach of or inaccuracy in any
Unqualified Representations; and (C) in no event shall any update, supplement
or amendment contained in a Disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

Schedule Update be deemed to have, or reasonably expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(iii) Graco shall give prompt notice to Purchaser Parent in writing of (x) any
event which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or
warranty that is subject to or qualified by a Completed Disclosure Schedule to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date
hereof to the Closing Date or that will result in the failure to satisfy any
of the conditions specified in _Article 7_, and (y) any event, circumstance
or change that first arises after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
that will result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions specified in
_Article 7_. From the date hereof until the Closing, Graco and Graco US
Finishing Brands may update or supplement the Disclosure Schedules to account
for any event, circumstance or change that first arises after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement that would make any representation or warranty
in this Agreement inaccurate if such representation or warranty were given at
Closing; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of an updated, supplemented
or amended Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this _Section 6.1(k)(iii)_ shall
not constitute a failure by Sellers to satisfy the condition to Purchasers
obligations to consummate the Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_; _provided,
further_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, no such update, supplement or amendment described in this _Section
6.1(k)(iii)_ shall affect or in any way limit Purchasers, Purchaser Parents
or the Purchaser Groups right to indemnification under _Article 8_ or the
determination of the presence of a breach of any representation or warranty
made on the Closing Date for purposes of _Article 8_. Purchaser Parents and
the Purchaser Groups sole remedy for any Damages uncovered by any updated,
supplemented or amended Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this _Section
6.1(k)(iii)_ shall be the Purchaser Groups right to indemnification under
_Article 8_ (if indemnification is available therefor).

 



 

(iv) From the date of execution of this Agreement and prior to Closing, in the
event that any patents, patent applications, trademarks and/or trademark
applications are listed on _Schedule 4.10(b)_ due to Sellers questions
related to ownership, transferability or maintenance, Graco shall cause
Sellers to use their best efforts to confirm in good faith ownership,
transferability or maintenance of such patents, patent applications,
trademarks and/or trademark applications, and if applicable, move such
patents, patent applications, trademarks and/or trademark applications to
_Schedule 1.2(a)_ , _Schedule 1.3_ or _Schedule 1.4_ , as applicable.

 



 

(l) _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.1(g)_
or _9.9_ , the timing and content of all announcements regarding any aspect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to the financial
community, government agencies, employees or the general public shall be
mutually agreed upon in advance by Graco and Purchaser Parent; _provided_ that
each party may make any such announcement which it in good faith believes,
based on advice of counsel, is required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with and agree on
the language of any announcement with the other party prior to any such
announcement to the extent practicable, and shall in any event promptly
provide the other party with copies of any such announcement.

 



      
 

 



 

(m) _Assumption of Contracts_. Notwithstanding anything otherwise set forth
herein, Purchasers rights under Contracts of the Liquid Finishing Business,
including the Scheduled Contracts, the Acquired ITW Ancillary Agreements and
any Acquired Contracts assumed hereunder, are assumed subject to the rights of
third parties to the extent such third parties have contractual rights that
require prior approval or consent in connection with the transfer or
assignment of the Contracts pursuant to the terms of any such Contracts. In
the event that any such consent, approval or waiver shall not have been
obtained prior to the Closing Date, and thereafter if any other party to a
contract objects to the transfer of an Acquired Contract as a breach of such
Contract, then as of the Closing, this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and such Contract, shall constitute full and equitable
assignment by Sellers to Purchasers of all of Sellers right, title and
interest in, to and under such assumed contracts ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Article 4_, Graco and Graco
US Finishing Brands make no representation or warranty with respect to the
transfer or assignability of any such contract). Upon request, Graco shall,
and shall cause Sellers to, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Purchasers in obtaining consents or approvals from third parties as may be
necessary to complete any transfer of any such contract. To the extent that
any such requested consents and waivers are not obtained, (i) until the
impediments to any such assignment are resolved, Graco shall, and shall cause
Sellers to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) provide to Purchasers
the benefits of any such contract, (b) hold all monies and other consideration
received by Sellers thereunder on and after the Closing Date in trust for the
account of Purchasers, (c) remit such money or other consideration to
Purchasers reasonably promptly and (d) enforce, at the request of and for the
account of Purchasers, at Purchasers sole expense, any rights of Sellers
arising from any such contract against any third Person. From and after the
Closing Date, Sellers authorize Purchasers to receive all the benefits of
Sellers under any such contracts, and appoint Purchasers their attorney-in-
fact to act in its name on its behalf with respect thereto. The provisions of
this _Section 6.1(m)_ shall not limit, modify or otherwise affect any
representation or warranty of Graco or Graco US Finishing Brands under this
Agreement.

the date hereof, certain assets and employees relating to, used in or arising
out of the Powder Finishing Business, in addition to the Liquid Finishing
Transferred Employees, are owned or employed by, or reside within, the Gema
Separation Acquired Subsidiaries (all of such assets (including inventory) and
employees, including the Liquid Finishing Transferred Employees, but excluding
the Retained Powder Assets, being the " _Trapped Gema Assets and Employees_
"); and (ii) it is the parties intention that the Gema Separation Acquired
Subsidiaries consummate various transactions (such transactions being, as to

Acquired Subsidiary, a " _Gema Separation Transaction_ " and, collectively,
the " _Gema Separation Transactions_ ") with one or more Affiliates of Graco
(which are not Acquired Subsidiaries or Asset Selling Subsidiaries) pursuant
to which all of the Gema Separation Acquired Subsidiaries Trapped Gema Assets
and Employees become owned or employed by, and become resident within, such
Affiliates of Graco. Graco and Purchaser Parent shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate the terms of such Contracts as are necessary
or advisable in order to consummate the Gema Separation Transactions, and to
cause the Gema Separation Transactions to be consummated on or before the
Closing Date pursuant to such Contracts.

 



       
 

 



 

6.2. _Post-Closing Covenants_. The parties agree as follows with respect to
the period from and after the Closing:

 



 

(a) _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any party is
actively contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, audit, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in
connection with (i) any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any
fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or
prior to the Closing Date involving any Seller or any Acquired Subsidiary,
each of the parties shall cooperate in the contest or defense, make available
their personnel, and provide such testimony and access to their books and
records as may be necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at
the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending party (unless the
contesting or defending party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
this Agreement).

 



 

(b) _Access and Information_. After the Closing, Purchaser Parent and US
Purchaser shall make available and shall cause the Liquid Finishing Business
to make available to Graco and its accountants, agents and representatives, at
reasonable times and upon prior written request, any and all books, records,
contracts and other information of the Liquid Finishing Business existing at
the Closing to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers for tax or
accounting purposes. Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser will cause the Liquid
Finishing Business to hold all material books and records of the Liquid
Finishing Business on the Closing Date and will retain and not destroy such
records in accordance with Purchaser Parents standard record retention
policy.

 



 

(c) _Financial Reporting_. Within six (6) days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser Parent shall provide to Graco the normal quarter and/or month end
balance sheet and other financial information of the type that the Liquid
Finishing Business provided to Graco via its financial reporting system for
past reporting periods, covering the period ending as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(i) Purchasers, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser acknowledge that the
information provided to them in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the Nondisclosure
Agreement, dated June 28, 2012, between Purchaser Parent and Graco. Effective
upon Closing, such confidentiality agreement shall terminate. Purchasers,
Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser further acknowledge and agree that Gracos
outside counsel, Lindquist and Vennum LLP and Covington and Burling LLP, have
each entered into Confidentiality Agreements with the Hold Separate Business
(as defined in the Hold Separate Order), which Confidentiality Agreements,
among other things, limit or prohibit the disclosure of "Competitively
Sensitive Evaluation Material" (in each case, as defined in such
Confidentiality Agreements) to Graco and its Affiliates and require Lindquist
and Vennum LLP and Covington and Burling LLP to return such Competitively
Sensitive Evaluation Material to the Hold Separate Managers (as defined in the
Hold Separate Order) upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. After the Closing, Purchasers, Purchaser Parent and US
Purchaser shall, upon request, make such

 



      
 

 



 

Competitively Sensitive Evaluation Material available to Gracos outside
counsel, on a "confidential-outside counsel only" basis and subject to such
other reasonable confidentiality restrictions as may be mutually agreed upon,
to enable Gracos outside counsel to advise Graco and its Affiliates in
connection the enforcement of their respective rights under this Agreement or
the defense or making of any claim pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Graco shall, and shall cause Sellers and Gracos others Affiliates to,
for a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, treat and hold as
confidential all, and not disclose any, of the Confidential Information or the
Carlisle Confidential Information and refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information or the Carlisle Confidential Information except, in
each case, only with respect the Confidential Information, but not the
Carlisle Confidential Information: (A) in connection with performance of
Sellers obligations under this Agreement or (B) as is otherwise necessary for
Tax reporting purposes, statutory accounting purposes or to enforce Sellers
rights under this Agreement. In the event that any Seller or other Affiliate
of Graco is requested or required (by oral question or request for information
or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information or Carlisle Confidential Information, Graco shall notify Purchaser
Parent promptly of the request or requirement so that Purchasers may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section. If, in the absence of a protective order or a duly given waiver by
Purchaser Parent, such Seller or other Affiliate of Graco is, on the advice of
counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information or Carlisle
Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt,
such Seller or other Affiliate of Graco may disclose such Confidential
Information or Carlisle Confidential Information to the tribunal; _provided,
however_ , that Graco shall cause the disclosing Seller or Affiliate to use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, at the request of Purchaser Parent, an
order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to the
Confidential Information or Carlisle Confidential Information required to be
disclosed.

 



 

(iii) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser shall, and shall cause Purchasers, the
Acquired Subsidiaries and Purchaser Parents and US Purchasers other
Affiliates to, for a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, treat and
hold as confidential all, and not disclose any, of the Graco Confidential
Information and refrain from using any of the Graco Confidential Information
for any purpose whatsoever except as is otherwise necessary for Tax reporting
purposes, statutory accounting purposes or to enforce Purchasers rights under
this Agreement. With respect to the foregoing, Purchaser Parent and US
Purchaser have been informed by Graco that the Liquid Finishing Business is in
possession of certain Graco Confidential Information related to Powder
Finishing Business customers, as to which Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser
hereby agree to limit access during such five-year period to those personnel
of Purchaser Parent and its Affiliates in finance or tax-related positions, to
be used by such persons only for the purpose of enabling Purchaser Parent and
its Affiliates to comply with requirements of Applicable Laws after the
Closing. In addition, Graco has informed Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser
that certain Employees may be aware of information concerning the Powder
Finishing Business due to the integration of portions of the Liquid

 



      
 

 



 

Finishing Business with the Powder Finishing Business prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the ITW Purchase Agreement
(which information, for the avoidance of doubt, constitutes Graco Confidential
Information); in connection therewith, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser
hereby agree to cause the Liquid Finishing Business not to exploit
intentionally such information (A) for the commercial benefit of the Liquid
Finishing Business or, (B) in connection with the discharge of any such
Employees duties as an employee of the Liquid Finishing Business, to the
commercial detriment of the Powder Finishing Business, in each case, during
such five-year period, and Graco agrees that the awareness of such information
by such Employees (without any intentional exploitation of such information in
violation of the foregoing terms and conditions) shall not prevent, in any
manner, the Liquid Finishing Business from competing with the Powder Finishing
Business after the 18-month anniversary of the Closing. In the event that any
Purchaser, Acquired Subsidiary or other Affiliate of Purchaser Parent or US
Purchaser is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Graco
Confidential Information, Purchaser Parent shall notify Graco promptly of the
request or requirement so that Sellers may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section. If, in the
absence of a protective order or a duly given waiver by Graco, such Purchaser,
Acquired Subsidiary or other Affiliate of Purchaser Parent or US Purchaser is,
on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Graco Confidential
Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Purchaser,
Acquired Subsidiary or other Affiliate of Purchaser Parent or US Purchaser may
disclose such Graco Confidential Information to the tribunal; _provided,
however_ , that Purchaser Parent shall cause the disclosing Purchaser,
Acquired Subsidiary or Affiliate to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
at the request of Graco, an order or other assurance that confidential
treatment shall be accorded to the Graco Confidential Information required to
be disclosed.

 



 

(e) _Non-Solicitation/Hiring of Liquid Finishing Business Employees_.

 



 

(i) To further ensure that Purchasers, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser
receive the expected benefits of acquiring the Liquid Finishing Business,
Graco agrees that, throughout the period that begins on the Closing Date and
ends on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Graco will not, and
will cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, knowingly
employ, attempt to employ, or solicit for employment any individual who on the
Closing Date is an Employee (other than Liquid Finishing Transferred
Employees) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt the employment relationship
(contractual or other) of any such Employee with any Purchaser or any
Affiliate of any Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
prohibits any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller from any (A) solicitation
for employment or hiring of any Liquid Finishing Transferred Employees or (B)
general solicitation for employment (including in any newspaper or magazine,
over the internet or by any search or employment agency) if not specifically
directed towards any Employee.

 



 

(ii) Graco, for itself and on behalf of Sellers, acknowledges and agrees that
(1) this _Section 6.2(e)_ is reasonable and necessary to ensure that
Purchaser Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

US Purchaser and Purchasers receive the expected benefits of acquiring the
Liquid Finishing Business, (2) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser have refused
to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this _Section 6.2(e)_ and (3)
breach of this _Section 6.2(e)_ will harm Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser and
Purchasers to such an extent that monetary damages alone would be an
inadequate remedy and Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser and Purchasers would not
have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of a breach by any
Seller of this _Section 6.2(e)_, Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser and
Purchasers (in addition to all other remedies they may have) will be entitled
to seek an injunction and other equitable relief (without posting any bond or
other security) restraining such Seller from committing or continuing such
breach and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms.

 



 

(f) _Powder Finishing Business Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(i) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser agree that, throughout the period that
begins on the Closing Date and ends on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of
the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser will not, and will cause
each of their respective Affiliates (including, but not limited to, the
Acquired Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, sell or offer to sell
to any Existing Powder Finishing Business Customer, or otherwise solicit any
Existing Powder Finishing Business Customer for the sale to any such Existing
Powder Finishing Business Customer of, any product (a " _Competitive Powder
Finishing Product_ " and, collectively, " _Competitive Powder Finishing
Products_ ") that is competitive with any product offered by the Powder
Finishing Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that, during such 18-month
period, nothing in this _Section 6.2(f)(i)_ shall prohibit Purchaser Parent,
US Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates from selling or offering to
sell DeVilbiss Powder Finishing Products to any Person within the DeVilbiss
Powder Finishing Products Field of Use, including any Existing Powder
Finishing Business Customer within the DeVilbiss Powder Finishing Products
Field of Use; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that, during such 18-month period,
nothing in this _Section 6.2(f)(i)_ shall prohibit Purchaser Parent, US
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates from selling or offering to
sell any Ransburg Powder Finishing Products to any Person within the Ransburg
Powder Finishing Products Field of Use, including any Existing Powder
Finishing Business Customer within the Ransburg Powder Finishing Products
Field of Use. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing terms and conditions
of this _Section 6.2(f)(i)_, in the event that, following the Closing,
Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser Parent or US
Purchaser acquires a business that manufactures and sells Competitive Powder
Finishing Products and an Existing Powder Finishing Business Customer is a
customer of such business as of the date of such acquisition, Purchaser
Parent, US Purchaser or any such Affiliate of Purchaser Parent or US Purchaser
(through such acquired business) shall be entitled to continue to sell such
Competitive Powder Finishing Products to such Existing Powder Finishing
Business Customers. In the event of a breach of the covenants contained in
this _Section 6.2(f)(i)_ as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the duration of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.2(f)(i)_ shall be
extended by a period of time equal to the period of the duration of such
breach. For the avoidance of doubt, Graco acknowledges and agrees that, after
the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date (as such date may be extended in
accordance with the immediately-preceding sentence), the

 



      
 

 



 

restrictions and limitations contained in this _Section 6.2(f)(i)_ shall no
longer be of any force or effect, and Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Liquid Finishing
Business) shall be permitted, directly and indirectly, to sell or offer to
sell to any Existing Powder Finishing Business Customer, and otherwise to
solicit any Existing Powder Finishing Business Customer for the sale to any
such Existing Powder Finishing Business Customer of, any Competitive Powder
Finishing Product or Competitive Powder Finishing Products.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser further agree that, throughout the
period that begins on the Closing Date and ends on the fourth (4th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser will not,
and will cause each of their respective Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, knowingly employ, attempt to employ, or solicit for employment any
individual, other than any Employee, who on the Closing Date is an employee of
Graco or any Affiliate of Graco, or otherwise interfere with or disrupt the
employment relationship (contractual or other) of any such employee with any
Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein prohibits Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates from any general solicitation for employment (including in any
newspaper or magazine, over the internet or by any search or employment
agency) if not specifically directed towards any such employee.

 



 

(iii) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser, for themselves and on behalf of
Purchasers, acknowledges and agrees that (1) Graco and Graco US Finishing
Brands have refused to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this
_Section 6.2(f)_ and (2) a breach of this _Section 6.2(f)_ will harm Graco,
Graco US Finishing Brands and their Affiliates to such an extent that monetary
damages alone would be an inadequate remedy and Graco and Graco US Finishing
Brands would not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of a
breach by any Purchaser of this _Section 6.2(f)_, Graco and Graco US
Finishing Brands (in addition to all other remedies they may have) will be
entitled to seek an injunction and other equitable relief (without posting any
bond or other security) restraining such Purchaser (and such Purchasers
Affiliates) from committing or continuing such breach and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and its terms.

 



 

(g) _Covenants Not to Sue_.

 



 

(i) From and after, and conditioned upon, the Closing, Graco, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates (whether or not presently existing, and including
Sellers): (A) covenants not to sue Purchasers, Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser
and their respective Affiliates (whether or not presently existing),
integrators, distributors, licensees, manufacturers and customers, on the
grounds that the research, development, manufacture, use, importation,
exportation, distribution, offer to sell or sale, prior to the Closing Date
(1) of any Historical Liquid Finishing Products, (2) of any Historical
DeVilbiss Powder Finishing Products, or (3) of any Historical Ransburg Powder

not Business Intellectual Property; (B) covenants not to sue Purchasers,
Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser and their respective Affiliates (whether or not
presently existing), integrators, distributors, licensees, manufacturers and

development, manufacture, use, importation, exportation, distribution, offer
to sell or sale, after the Closing Date (1) of any Historical Liquid Finishing
Products anywhere in the world, (2) of any Historical DeVilbiss Powder
Finishing Products anywhere in South America, or (3) of any Historical
Ransburg Powder Finishing Products in the transportation and related supply
chain markets, infringes any Acquired ITW Intellectual Property that is not
Business Intellectual Property; and (C) covenants not to seek to challenge or
invalidate any of the Business Intellectual Property in a civil action or
administrative proceeding. For purposes hereof, " _Acquired ITW Intellectual
Property_ " means any and all Intellectual Property that was acquired by Graco
and its Affiliates from ITW Parent and its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the ITW Purchase Agreement and, immediately prior
to the Closing, is an asset of Graco or an Affiliate of Graco.

 



 

(ii) From and after, and conditioned upon, the Closing, Purchaser Parent, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (whether or not presently existing, and
including Purchasers): (A) covenants not to sue Graco, Sellers, Graco US

existing), integrators, distributors, licensees, manufacturers and customers,
on the grounds that the research, development, manufacture, use, importation,
exportation, distribution, offer to sell or sale of any Historical Gema Powder
Finishing Products anywhere in the world infringes any of the Acquired ITW
Intellectual Property that is Business Intellectual Property; and (B)
covenants not to seek to challenge or invalidate any of the Acquired ITW
Intellectual Property that is not Business Intellectual Property in a civil
action or administrative proceeding.

 



 

6.3. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser shall cause the applicable Purchasers to
adopt and assume at and as of the Closing each of the Employee Benefit
Plan/Schemes, and each trust, insurance contract, annuity contract or other
funding arrangement with respect thereto, of the Asset Selling Subsidiaries or
the Acquired Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 6.3(a)_ as such plans relate
to Employees employed immediately prior to Closing (other than Liquid
Finishing Transferred Employees) or retirees of the Liquid Finishing Business
(the " _Assumed Benefit Plans/Schemes_ "), and shall assume and exercise any
and all rights, authorities, discretions and obligations as sponsor, named
fiduciary and plan administrator of the Assumed Benefit Plans/Schemes. Such
Purchasers shall cause the Assumed Benefit Plans/Schemes to be amended, as
applicable, to treat employment with the Asset Selling Subsidiaries or the
Acquired Subsidiaries prior to the Closing the same as employment with such
Purchaser from and after the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and
vesting and the respective Assumed Benefit Plans/Schemes shall be responsible
for group health plan continuation coverage required under Applicable Law for
any qualified beneficiary under such Assumed Benefit Plans/Schemes as of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Graco will
deliver to Purchaser Parent an updated Employee List setting forth the
information required by _Section 4.12(n)_, as of ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, rather than as of the dates referenced in _Section
4.12(n)_. At least five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date,

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser will, or will cause the applicable Purchaser
to, offer employment to each Employee identified on the updated Employee List
who is an Employee of Graco or an Affiliate of Graco (or than an Acquired
Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Closing (other than any Liquid Finishing
Transferred Employee), with such employment to be effective immediately
following, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Closing (or, in the case
of any Employee of Graco or an Affiliate of Graco (other than an Acquired
Subsidiary) on long-term disability or other leave of absence as disclosed on
_Schedule 4.12(n)_ (each, an " _Inactive Employee_ "), effective upon the
date such Inactive Employee is able to return to active employment as
determined by Purchaser Parent or the applicable Purchaser provided that such
return occurs within one (1) year following the Closing Date, except in the
case of any Inactive Employee disclosed on _Schedule 6.3(b)_ as of the date
of this Agreement, effective immediately following, and contingent upon the
occurrence of, the Closing). Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that: (i) the Liquid Finishing Transferred Employees are employees
(whether full-time, part-time or contract) of certain of the Acquired
Subsidiaries and are engaged in the Liquid Finishing Business; and (ii)
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Liquid Finishing Transferred Employees
shall be transferred from such Acquired Subsidiaries to an Affiliate of Graco
engaged in the Powder Finishing Business.

 



 

(c) With respect to each Employee of Graco or an Affiliate of Graco (other
than an Acquired Subsidiary) who Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser offers employment to under _Section 6.3(b)_, such offer
shall include base salary compensation substantially comparable to such
Employees base salary compensation immediately prior to Closing and medical
benefits through the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date that are
substantially comparable to such Employees medical benefits immediately prior
to Closing. Nothing in this _Section 6.3(c)_ or this Agreement shall be
deemed to interfere with Purchaser Parents, US Purchasers or the applicable
Purchasers ability to classify the Hired Employees as employees "at will."

 



 

(d) Graco and Purchaser Parent shall, and shall cause Sellers and Purchasers
(as applicable) to, as applicable, exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
persuade all Employees of Graco and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Subsidiaries) offered employment with Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or any
Purchaser under _Section 6.3(b)_ to accept such offers of employment. Neither
Graco nor any of its Affiliates will seek to induce any Employee of Graco or
any Affiliate of Graco (other than an Acquired Subsidiary) to reject any offer
of employment from Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or any Purchaser. Employees
who accept offers of employment from Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or any
Purchaser shall become employees of Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or such
Purchaser (as applicable) immediately following the Closing (or, in the case
of any Inactive Employee not identified on _Schedule 6.3(b)_ , upon the date
each such Inactive Employee is able to return to active employment as
determined by Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
subject to such limitation as identified in _Section 6.3(b)_) and shall then
cease to be employees of Graco or its applicable Affiliates (provided that, in
the case of Inactive Employees, Graco or its applicable Affiliates retains
discretion to terminate employment of Inactive Employees at any date it deems
appropriate which is no later than the date of hire by Purchaser Parent, US
Purchaser or any Purchaser). Such Employees of Graco and its Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Subsidiaries) who accept offers of employment from Purchaser
Parent, US Purchaser or any Purchaser and who complete all necessary documents
in order to commence employment

 



      
 

 



 

with Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or such Purchaser (as applicable), and
commence employment with Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or any Purchaser
immediately following the Closing (or, in the case of any Inactive Employee
not identified on _Schedule 6.3(b)_ , immediately following the date each such
Inactive Employee is able to return to active employment), together with all
employees of any Acquired Subsidiary as of the Closing Date (other than the
Liquid Finishing Transferred Employees), shall be the " _Hired Employees_."
Neither Graco nor any of its Affiliates shall state or represent to any
Employees not identified on the Employee List (as updated in accordance with
the first sentence of _Section 6.3(b)_) that Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser
or any Purchaser is obligated to continue such Employees employment or will
offer such Employees employment.

 



 

(e) Graco, Purchaser Parent and each of their applicable Affiliates
acknowledge that certain employee transfer regulations may apply to the
transfer of certain Non-U.S. Employees under Applicable Law, and Graco,
Purchaser Parent and each of their applicable Affiliates agree to satisfy and
comply with any employee transfer regulations that apply to the transfer of
Non-U.S. Employees in accordance with and subject to Applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser agree to, and shall cause each
applicable Purchaser to agree to, continue to be bound by and comply with the
terms of any written employment agreements between any Employee, on the one
hand, and Graco and any Affiliate of Graco, on the other hand, for each
Employee who becomes a Hired Employee, subject to and only to the extent
required under Applicable Law; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
6.3(f)_ shall obligate Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or any Purchaser to
continue to be bound by or comply with the terms of any such employment
agreement for any period longer than as required under such employment
agreement or under Applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser hereby agree that, from and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
applicable Purchaser and the Acquired Subsidiaries to, grant all Hired
Employees credit for any service with Graco or its Affiliates earned prior to
the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting purposes (but for no other
purpose) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established
or maintained by Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser the applicable Purchaser or
the applicable Acquired Subsidiary in which such Hired Employees participate
on or after the Closing Date, whether or not such plan, program or arrangement
is an Employee Benefit Plan/Scheme, (ii) for purposes of vacation and
severance benefits, and (iii) for any other purpose as required under
Applicable Law.

 



 

(h) On and after the Closing Date, to the extent legally applicable, Graco
shall (or cause each of its applicable Affiliates to) have all responsibility
and liability for meeting all requirements under "COBRA" with respect to each
Person who is or becomes an "M and A qualified beneficiary," within the meaning
of Treas. Reg. Sec. 54.4980B-9, Q/A-4(b), with respect to the Liquid Finishing
Business (including any individual who has a qualifying event as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

(i) Graco shall (or shall cause each of its applicable Affiliates to) pay all
employment-related benefits, excluding all amounts owed for accrued vacation
or other paid leave (which amounts shall be assumed by Purchasers, but only to
the extent such amounts are

 



      
 

 



 

included in the Final Closing Balance Sheet), earned or accrued through the
Closing Date for all Employees not employed by an Acquired Subsidiary,
including for all Hired Employees (other than Employees employed by an
Acquired Subsidiary) in accordance with Applicable Law and Sellers past
practices. Graco shall (or shall cause each of its applicable Affiliates to)
pay all severance that may due and payable as a result loss or deemed on
constructive termination of employment in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Graco or its applicable Affiliates shall make
any payments required to be made under this _Section 6.3(i)_ either by making
such payments directly to such Employees or, in the event Purchaser Parent, US
Purchaser or any Purchaser pays any Employee any such amount, by reimbursing
Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser for such payment to
the degree such payment was not reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet.

 



 

(j) With respect to any Hired Employees, as applicable:

 



 

(i) Sellers and Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
shall treat the applicable Purchaser employer as a "successor employer" and
Sellers as a "predecessor employer" within the meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1)
and 3306(b)(1) of the Code for purposes of Taxes imposed under the United
States Federal Unemployment Tax Act or the United States Federal Insurance
Contributions Act; and

 



 

(ii) Sellers will utilize, or will cause their respective Affiliates to
utilize, the standard procedure set forth in Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with
respect to wage reporting.

 



 

(k) Graco and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts, before
and after the Closing, to provide such information as Purchaser Parent, US
Purchaser or any Purchaser may reasonably request for purposes of fulfilling
their obligations under this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

6.4. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Payment of Taxes_. Sellers, jointly and severally, will satisfy (or cause
to be satisfied) in full when due all Income Taxes with respect to (1) any
Seller or any Acquired Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(2) the Liquid Finishing Business with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(3) any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of
which any Seller (or any predecessor thereto) or Acquired Subsidiary is or was
a member before Closing, including Income Taxes pursuant to Treasury
Regulation 1.1502-6 or any similar Applicable Law, and (4) any Person (other
than a Seller) imposed on any Seller or any Acquired Subsidiary or with
respect to the Liquid Finishing Business for any period as a transferee or
successor with respect to any transaction occurring on or before the Closing
Date, by Applicable Law, Contract or otherwise (all of such Taxes being the "
_Pre-Closing Income Taxes_ "). Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser will satisfy
(or cause to be satisfied) in full when due all Income Taxes attributable to
the Liquid Finishing Business with respect to any period that is not a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, including Income Taxes of each Acquired Subsidiary that
are not Pre-Closing Income Taxes. If Purchaser Parent or US Purchaser is
required under _Section 6.4(b)_ to file a Tax Return that involves Pre-
Closing Income Taxes, then no later than five (5) Business Days before the
filing of any such Tax Return, Graco will pay to Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

Parent or US Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of Income Taxes shown due
on such Tax Return for which any Seller is obligated under this _Section
6.4(a)_ with respect to such Tax Return.

 



 

(b) _Filing Responsibility_. Subject to such Tax Returns as are to be prepared
and filed (or caused to be prepared and timely filed) by ITW Parent and its
Affiliates pursuant to the ITW Purchase Agreement, Graco will, or will cause
Sellers to, prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed)
all (1) Tax Returns of any Seller or any Acquired Subsidiary required to be
filed on or before the Closing Date (after taking into account extensions
therefor) and (2) all Tax Returns involving Income Taxes with respect to the
Liquid Finishing Business or the Acquired Assets with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed on or after the Closing Date.
To the extent that any such Tax Returns filed by Sellers relate to any
Acquired Subsidiary, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with
past practice (unless a contrary position is required by Applicable Law).
Subject to such Tax Returns as are to be prepared and filed (or caused to be
prepared and timely filed) by ITW Parent and its Affiliates pursuant to the
ITW Purchase Agreement, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser will prepare and
timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) all Tax Returns that
Sellers and the Acquired Subsidiaries are not obligated to file (or cause to
be filed) pursuant to this _Section 6.4(b)_. Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser
and Sellers will discharge all Income Tax liabilities shown on any Tax Return
based on the assumption and allocation of Income Tax liabilities provided in
this Agreement without regard to the party that has prepared the Tax Return,
and the party responsible for payment of any amount of Income Taxes shown due
on a Tax Return shall pay such unpaid amount to the party filing the Tax
Return no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the filing of such Tax
Return.

 



 

(c) _Straddle Periods_. In the case of a Straddle Period, the amount of any
Pre-Closing Income Taxes shall be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the Effective Time on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any Acquired Subsidiary that is a partnership or other
pass-through entity shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and the amount
of other Income Taxes for the Straddle Period that are treated as Pre-Closing
Income Taxes shall be deemed to be the amount of such Income Tax for the
entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Income Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Graco and Purchaser Parent each shall pay one-half of
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
" _Transfer Taxes_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the aggregate amount
of all such Transfer Taxes exceeds $1,000,000, Graco shall pay all Transfer
Taxes to the extent they exceed $1,000,000. Graco shall and shall cause
Sellers to, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns, reports,
forms, and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and
charges.

 



 

(e) _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. Each Seller and each Acquired Subsidiary will
terminate all Tax-sharing agreements and similar arrangements with respect to
any Acquired

 



       
 

 



 

Subsidiary or the Liquid Finishing Business before or as of the Closing Date
to the extent required to cause no Acquired Subsidiary to be bound therefor or
have any Liability thereunder after the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) _Audits and Contests Regarding Taxes_.

 



 

(i) If any Seller, on the one hand, or any Purchaser or Acquired Subsidiary,
on the other hand, receives any notice of a pending or threatened Income Tax
audit, assessment, or adjustment relating to an Acquired Subsidiary or the
Liquid Finishing Business that may give rise to a liability of the other (a "
_Tax Proceeding_ "), Graco or Purchaser Parent (as applicable) shall promptly
notify the other within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of such notice;
provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification obligations under _Article 8_ unless (and only to the extent
that) such failure prejudices the indemnifying party. The parties each agree
to consult with and to keep each other informed on a regular basis regarding
the status of any Tax Proceeding to the extent that such Tax Proceeding could
affect such other party (including indemnity obligations hereunder).

 



 

(ii) Sellers shall have the right to represent their interests in any Tax
Proceeding and to employ counsel of their choice and at their expense, to the
extent such Tax Proceeding pertains to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of an Acquired
Subsidiary, and no such Tax Proceeding shall be closed, settled, or otherwise
terminated without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Purchaser Parent and Graco shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to) cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 6.4 and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Income Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys reasonable request) access to the
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available as reasonably
requested on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Subject to the requirements of
the ITW Purchase Agreement, the Sellers shall retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Liquid Finishing Business
relating to any Income Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Purchasers, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and abide
by all record-retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Authority.

 



 

(h) _338(g) Election_. Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser shall not, and shall
not permit any Purchaser or Acquired Subsidiary to, file an election under
section 338(g) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or
non-U.S. law) with respect to any Acquired Subsidiary, other than Graco Brazil
Finishing Brands and Graco UK Finishing Brands, without the prior written
consent of Graco, it being acknowledged and agreed that such an election may
be made with respect to Graco Brazil Finishing Brands and Graco UK Finishing
Brands without the prior written consent of Graco.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _Survival of Obligations_. The obligations of the parties set forth in
this _Section 6.4_ shall be unconditional and absolute and shall remain in
effect until the expiration of the applicable period of limitations on
assessments.

 



 

6.5. _Environmental Investigation and Remediation_. Graco shall not be
responsible for any investigation or remediation costs if such investigation
or remediation is not required to comply with relevant Environmental Laws.
Purchasers, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser shall conduct any required
environmental investigation of the Owned Real Property or any Leased Real
Property in a commercially reasonable manner consistent with the American
Society for Test and Measurement (" _ASTM_ ") "E1527-05 Standard Practice for
Environmental Site Assessments; Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process"
and, if intrusive investigation is prudent, ASTM "E1903-97 (2002) Standard
Guide for Environmental Site Assessments; Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment Process" or substantially equivalent consensus standards. When
intrusive investigation is prudent, analytical results for environmental media
samples shall be compared to relevant screening and cleanup standards
consistent with commercial-industrial land use. Graco shall not be responsible
for costs to delineate contamination or remediate soil or groundwater to
comply with unrestricted land use standards (including but not limited to
residential standards). Purchasers, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser shall,
where applicable, utilize site-specific risk assessment, engineered barriers,
and environmental land use restrictions in lieu of active _in situ_ or _ex
situ_ remediation techniques to satisfy requirements of relevant Environmental
Law. Following the Closing Date, Purchasers, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser
shall (1) keep Graco informed of the commencement and progress of any required
investigation or remediation of the Owned Real Property or any Leased Real
Property and provide Graco with copies of analytical results for environmental
media samples from investigation or remediation and copies of reports
submitted to any Governmental Authority; and (2) provide reasonable advance
notice to Graco of meetings with any Governmental Authority or affected third
party regarding investigation or remediation of the Owned Real Property or any
Leased Real Property and allow Gracos representative to attend such meetings.

 



 

6.6. _FTC-Required Compliance Training Programs_. Following the Closing Date
and for so long as is reasonably requested by the FTC (but, in any event, not
exceeding two (2) years), each of Graco and Purchaser Parent shall maintain
and participate in any FTC-required antitrust compliance programs related to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.7. _Retained Powder Finishing Accounts Receivable_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, Purchaser Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Acquired Subsidiaries) to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect all Retained Powder Finishing
Business Accounts Receivable; _provided_ , _however_ , that in seeking to
collect upon or recover any amounts under any Retained Powder Finishing
Business Accounts Receivable, Purchaser Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates to not, take any action (including, but not limited to, taking or
threatening to take any legal action) which could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the business relationship between Graco or any Affiliate of
Graco, on the one hand, and any account debtor or third party business
relationship of the Powder Finishing Business, on the other hand. Any payment
received from an account debtor on a Retained Powder Finishing Business
Account Receivable shall be applied in accordance with the remittance advice
accompanying such payment and, in

 



      
 

 



 

the absence of such remittance advice, in priority of the oldest of such
account debtors Retained Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivable to the
most recent of such account debtors Retained Powder Finishing Business
Accounts Receivable.

 



 

(b) On or before the 50th day following the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent
shall deliver a written notice to Graco identifying all Retained Powder
Finishing Business Accounts Receivable which have not been collected in full
by Purchaser Parent and its Affiliates on or before the 45th day following the
Closing Date, together with the amounts thereof. In addition, on or before the
95th day following the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent shall deliver a written
notice to Graco identifying all Retained Powder Finishing Business Accounts
Receivable which have not been collected in full by Purchaser Parent and its
Affiliates on or before the 90th day following the Closing Date, together with
the amounts thereof.

 



 

(c) On or before the 125th day following the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent
shall deliver a written notice to Graco identifying all Retained Powder
Finishing Business Accounts Receivable which have not been collected in full
by Purchaser Parent and its Affiliates on or before the 120th day following
the Closing Date (such Closing Date Accounts Receivable which have not been
collected in full by Purchaser Parent and its Affiliates on or before the
120th day following the Closing Date being the " _Past Due Retained Powder
Finishing Business Accounts Receivable_ "), together with the amounts thereof.
In the event that the aggregate amount of Past Due Retained Powder Finishing
Business Accounts Receivable exceeds the amount of the reserve (if any) for
doubtful accounts in respect of the Retained Powder Finishing Business
Accounts Receivable taken in account in calculating Net Working Capital on the
Final Closing Statement (following completion of the procedures described in
_Sections 3.2(a)_ and _(b)_ ) (the amount of such excess, if any, being the "
_Retained Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivables Repurchase Amount_
"), then at Purchaser Parents option, Graco and its Affiliates shall be
obligated to purchase from Purchaser Parent and its Affiliates all of the Past
Due Retained Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivable for the Retained
Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivables Repurchase Amount. Purchaser
Parent may exercise such option by delivering a written notice (the "
_Retained Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivables Repurchase Notice_ ")
of such exercise to Graco at any time within thirty (30) days following the
later of (x) completion of the procedures described in _Sections 3.2(a)_ and
_(b)_ and payment of any amounts due and owing under _Section 3.2(c)_ and
(y) Purchaser Parents delivery of the written notice described in this first
sentence of this _Section 6.7(c)_. Within ten (10) days of Purchaser Parents
delivery of the Retained Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivable
Repurchase Notice, Graco and its Affiliates shall pay to Purchaser Parent (in
immediately-available funds) an amount equal to the Retained Powder Finishing
Business Accounts Receivables Repurchase Amount. Upon Purchaser Parents
receipt of the Retained Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivables
Repurchase Amount, Purchaser Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
assign to Graco and its Affiliates, without recourse, all Past Due Retained
Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivable, and Graco and its Affiliates
shall thereafter be entitled to seek to collect, for their own account, all
Past Due Retained Powder Finishing Business Accounts Receivable so
repurchased.

the limitations on indemnification contained in the ITW Purchase Agreement)
assuming _arguendo_ that the Purchaser Group were a direct beneficiary of the
ITW Purchase Agreement Purchaser Groups indemnification rights under Article
8 of the ITW Purchase Agreement and the Purchaser Group were entitled to bring
an indemnification claim directly against ITW Parent pursuant to Article 8 of
the ITW Purchase Agreement for such Damages. For the avoidance of doubt,
Gracos obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Group pursuant to this _Section
8.2(b)_ is not dependent or conditioned upon ITW Parents fulfillment of its
obligation to indemnify the ITW Purchaser Group under Article 8 of the ITW
Purchase Agreement for any Damages for which Graco is obligated to indemnify
the Purchaser Group pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)_.

 



 

8.3. _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Purchasers, Purchaser Parent and US
Purchaser will, jointly and severally, indemnify Sellers and Sellers
affiliates (other than, after the Closing, the Acquired Subsidiaries) and
their respective directors, managers, officers, shareholders, members, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ")
harmless from and against any and all Damages that are incurred by the Seller
Group arising from or related to:

 



 

(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Purchasers, Purchaser Parent or US Purchaser in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered by Purchasers, Purchaser Parent or US Purchaser pursuant
to this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any breach of or failure by any Purchaser, Purchaser Parent or US
Purchaser to perform any covenant or obligation set out or contemplated in
this Agreement; or

 



 

(c) any Assumed Liability (except to the extent that Purchaser Group is
entitled to indemnification with respect to such Assumed Liability under
_Section 8.2(a)_ or would be so entitled but for the limitations set forth in
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.4_).

 



 

8.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) The maximum amount of indemnification payments the Purchaser Group shall
be entitled to receive from Graco for (A) Damages under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_

Damages under _Sections 8.2(a)(ii)_ through _(x)_ or Damages under _Section
8.2(b)_ that are not ITW Section 8.2(a) Capped Damages, which shall not be
subject to the limitations described in this _Section 8.4(a)_) shall be
$78,000,000.00 in the aggregate (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to, and Damages
arising out of any of the following shall not be taken into consideration for
purposes of determining whether the Indemnification Cap has been reached in
respect of Damages under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_: (i) any breach of the
representations and warranties made by Graco and Graco US Finishing Brands in
_Section 4.1(a)_, _4.1(b)_ , _4.1(c)_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.4(a)_ , _4.8_ or
_4.24_ ; or (ii) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Graco
and Graco US Finishing Brands in this Agreement which constitutes fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The maximum amount of indemnification payments the Purchaser Group shall
be entitled to receive from Graco for (A) Damages under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_
with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties made by Graco
and Graco US Finishing Brands in _Section 4.1(a)_, _4.1(b)_ , _4.1(c)_ ,
_4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.4(a)_ , _4.8_ or _4.24_ and (B) ITW Section 8.2(a) Cap-
Excluded Damages under _Section 8.2(b)_, shall in the aggregate be the amount
of the Purchase Price.

 



 

(c) Graco shall have no liability for (A) Damages under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_
(other than with respect to any liability under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any
breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty set forth in
_Section 4.1(a)_, _4.1(b)_ , _4.1(c)_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.4(a)_ , _4.8_ or
_4.24_ , for which indemnification shall be available on a first-dollar basis)
or (B) ITW Section 8.2(a) Capped Damages under _Section 8.2(b)_, until the
aggregate of all such Damages arising out of all matters set forth in _Section
8.2(a)(i)_, taken together with all ITW Section 8.2(a) Capped Damages under
_Section 8.2(b)_, exceeds $1,600,000.00 (the " _Basket_ "), and then only to
the extent of the excess.

 



 

(d) Graco shall have no liability for (A) Damages under _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_
or (B) ITW Section 8.2(c) Damages under _Section 8.2(b)_, until the aggregate
of all such Damages arising out of all matters set forth in _Section
8.2(a)(iii)_, taken together with all ITW Section 8.2(c) Damages under
_Section 8.2(b)_, exceeds $4,000,000.00, and then only to the extent of the
excess.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(viii)_, Damages shall include
only one-half (rather than all) of any court costs and reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in
this _Section 8.4(e)_ shall not apply if Graco shall have assumed the defense
of the Third Party Claim giving rise to the claim under _Section
8.2(a)(viii)_.

 



 

(f) The maximum amount of indemnification payments the Purchaser Group shall
be entitled to receive from Graco for (A) Damages under _Section 8.2(a)(ix)_
and (B) ITW Section 8.2(j) Damages under _Section 8.2(b)_, shall be
$8,000,000.00 in the aggregate.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this _Article 8_: (A) in determining the amount of
Damages arising from or relating to any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty in this Agreement (but not for purposes of
determining whether such a breach or inaccuracy occurred), all materiality and
Material Adverse Effect qualifiers will be ignored and each such
representation and warranty will be read and interpreted without regard to
such qualifier; and (B) in determining the amount of Damages arising from or
relating to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty in
the ITW Purchase Agreement for which the Purchaser Group may seek
indemnification under _Section 8.2(b)_, effect shall be given to the
limitations contained in Section 8.4(g) of the ITW Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(h) Limitations on Indemnification Obligations.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser
Group shall not have a right to assert claims under, and Graco shall not have
any liability to the Purchaser Group under, _Section 8.2(a)_ of this
Agreement for (1)

 



      
 

 



 

Damages to the extent that such Damages arise out of a fact, circumstance,
occurrence, event, act or Liability occurring or arising on or before April 2,
2012, or (2) Damages arising out of a fact, circumstance, occurrence, event,
act or Liability, to the extent that, by the terms of Article 8 of the ITW
Purchase Agreement (and without giving effect to any of the limitations on
indemnification contained in the ITW Purchase Agreement), ITW Parent has
agreed to indemnify the ITW Purchase Agreement Purchaser Group for ITW
Purchase Agreement Damages arising out of such fact, circumstance, occurrence,
event, act or Liability. The foregoing limitation applies notwithstanding the
fact that (A) Damages could otherwise arise from or relate to the matters
identified in _Section 8.2(a)_ due to facts, circumstances, occurrences,
events, acts or Liabilities occurring or arising prior to April 2, 2012 and
(B) certain of the representations and warranties made by Graco and Graco US
Finishing Brands contained in this Agreement may refer to facts,
circumstances, occurrences, events and Liabilities on or before April 2, 2012
or have application to periods on or before April 2, 2012. Nothing in this
_Section 8.4(h)(i)_ is intended to limit the Purchaser Groups
indemnification rights under _Section 8.2(b)_.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for (1) Damages arising out of a fact, circumstance, occurrence, event,
act or Liability occurring or arising on or before April 2, 2012 and (2)
Damages arising out of a fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, act or
Liability, to the extent that, by the terms of Article 8 of the ITW Purchase
Agreement (and without giving effect to any of the limitations on
indemnification contained in the ITW Purchase Agreement), ITW Parent has
agreed to indemnify the ITW Purchase Agreement Purchaser Group for ITW
Purchase Agreement Damages arising out of such fact, circumstance, occurrence,
event, act or Liability.

 



 

(iii) The Purchaser Group shall not have a right to assert claims under any
provision of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, _Section 8.2(a)_
or _(b)_ ) for any Damages to the extent that such Damages arise out of
actions taken by or omitted to be taken by Purchaser or the Liquid Finishing
Business after the Closing Date.

 



 

(iv) The rights of the Purchaser Group to indemnification for (x) Damages
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ and _(iii)(A)_ , (y) ITW
Section 8.2(a) Capped Damages under _Section 8.2(b)_, and (z) ITW Section
8.2(a) Cap-Excluded Damages under _Section 8.2(b)_, are in each case subject
to the following limitations: the amount of any and all Damages will be
determined net of any (1) applicable accruals or reserves included in the
calculation of the Net Working Capital on the Final Closing Statement; (2)
amounts actually recovered by the Purchaser Group under indemnification
agreements or arrangements with third parties or under insurance policies with
respect to such Damages (and no right of subrogation shall accrue to any such
third party indemnitor or insurer hereunder), and (3) an amount equal to the
Tax savings or benefits actually realized by the Purchaser Group that is
attributable to any deduction, loss, credit or other Tax benefit resulting
from or arising out of such Damages. An Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect any applicable insurance proceeds
(including (A) an assignment to the Indemnifying Party of its right to pursue
claims thereto (to the extent freely assignable) and (B) providing the
Indemnifying Party

 



      
 

 



 

with reasonable assistance in pursuing any such assigned claim (at the
Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense)).

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon any
Indemnified Partys becoming aware of any claim as to which indemnification
may be sought by such Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article 8_, such
Indemnified Party shall utilize all reasonable efforts, consistent with normal
practices and policies and good commercial practice, to mitigate such Losses.

 



 

(i) _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 8_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
Damages (but not for injunctive or other non-monetary relief) with respect to
any and all claims (whether in contract or tort) relating to this Agreement,
including any breach of the covenants, agreements, representations or
warranties set forth herein, the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent of fraud or willful
misconduct by any Person.

 



 

(j) Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser covenant and agree that, following the
Closing, Purchaser Parent and US Purchaser will not, and will cause its
Affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Acquired Subsidiaries) to not,
exercise any (or attempt to exercise any) indemnification rights they may have
(or may purport to have) under the ITW Purchase Agreement.

 



 

8.5. _Procedure for Indemnification of Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Notice of Third Party Claims_. If any action, claim, suit, proceeding,
arbitration, order, or governmental investigation or audit is filed or
initiated by any third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against any party
entitled to the benefit of indemnity under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), written notice of such Third Party Claim shall be given to the
party owing indemnity (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within 30 days after the service of the citation or summons,
or on such earlier date as is required to comply with legal process);
_provided, however_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely
notice shall not affect any rights to indemnification hereunder except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual damage caused by such
failure.

 



 

(b) _Defense and Settlement_. If any Third Party Claim is brought against an
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim and, at its option (unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood
exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) the Indemnified Party has failed to assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim within 15 days after receipt of notice
thereof), to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for which the
Indemnifying Party may have an indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(viii)_ or _(ix)_. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, (i) no compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim
may be

 



      
 

 



 

effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent
unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Applicable Law
or the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party (or any of its affiliates
or their respective directors, managers, officers, shareholders, members,
agents, or representatives) and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall have no Liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such Third Party Claim effected without its consent. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the
progress of the defense and any compromise or settlement of such claim and
will consult with, when appropriate, and consider any reasonable advice from,
the Indemnified Party with respect to any such defense, compromise, or
settlement. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement of
any Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within 15 days
after the Indemnified Partys notice is given, elect to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any
determination made in such Third Party Claim or any compromise or settlement
effected by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate at its
own expense in such defense (including in any proceedings regarding such Third
Party Claim) and will have the right to receive copies of all notices,
pleadings or other similar submissions regarding such defense.

 



 

(c) _Non-Monetary Claims_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified
Party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Third Party Claim would adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a
result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying
Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Third
Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party shall not be bound by any
determination of a Third Party Claim so defended or any compromise or
settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably
withheld).

 



 

8.6. _Procedure for Indemnification of Other Claims_. A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be
asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

 



 

8.7. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The parties shall treat any
indemnity payments made pursuant to this _Article 8_ as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all federal, state, local, and foreign Tax purposes (unless
otherwise required by a Governmental Authority).

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

9.1. _Termination_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated:

 



 

(i) at any time prior to the Closing by mutual written agreement of Purchaser
Parent and Graco;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) by Purchaser Parent, at any time prior to the Closing in the event that
either Graco or Graco US Finishing Brands is in breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants made by Graco or Graco US Finishing
Brands in this Agreement such that the conditions contained in _Sections
7.1(a)_ or _(b)_ are not capable of being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_
, that such condition is not the result of any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of any Purchaser, Purchaser Parent or US Purchaser set
forth in this Agreement, and, _provided_ , _further_ , that for the avoidance
of doubt Purchaser Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ due to any update, supplement or
amendment contained in a Disclosure Schedule Update, any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Graco or Graco US
Finishing Brands in this Agreement that is subject to or qualified by one or
more Incomplete Disclosure Schedules, or any breach of or inaccuracy in any
Unqualified Representations;

 



 

(iii) by Graco, at any time prior to the Closing in the event that any
Purchaser, Purchaser Parent or US Purchaser is in breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants made by any Purchaser, Purchaser
Parent or US Purchaser in this Agreement such that the conditions contained in
_Sections 7.2(a)_ or _(b)_ are not capable of being satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such condition is not the result of any breach of any
covenant representation, warranty or covenant of Sellers set forth in this
Agreement;

 



 

(iv) by Purchaser Parent, if any condition in _Section 7.1_ becomes incapable
of fulfillment at Closing; _provided_ that Purchaser Parent has not waived
such condition;

 



 

(v) by Graco, if any condition in _Section 7.2_ becomes incapable of
fulfillment at Closing; _provided_ that Graco has not waived such condition;
or

 



 

(vi) by Graco, at any time after January 7, 2015, if (A) the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.2(d)_ have not been waived by Graco or satisfied on or
prior to such date (unless the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2(d)_ resulted primarily from the breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement by Graco or any other
Seller), and (B) the Closing has not occurred on or prior to such date;

 



 

(vii) by Graco, at any time after February 7, 2015, if (A) the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.2(d)_ have been waived by Graco or satisfied on or prior
to such date, (B) all of the other conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_,
except for the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(g)_ and those conditions
that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing, have not been
waived by Graco or satisfied on or prior to such date (unless the failure to
satisfy any of such other conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ resulted
primarily from the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement by Graco or any other Seller), and (C) the Closing
has not occurred on or prior to such date;

 



 

(viii) by Graco, on the one hand, or Purchaser Parent, on the other hand, at
any time after April 4, 2015, if the Closing shall not have occurred by such
date, unless

 



      
 

 



 

the failure or delay resulted primarily from the breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement by the party or parties
initiating such termination.

 



 

(b) Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_,
_(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ or _(viii)_ shall be effected by
written notice from Graco to Purchaser Parent (if Graco is the terminating
party) or Purchaser Parent to Graco (if Purchaser Parent is the terminating
party), which notice shall specify the basis therefor. Any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_
, _(vii)_ or _(viii)_ shall not terminate the liability of any party for any
breach or default of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
set forth in this Agreement which exists at the time of such termination, and
the provisions of _Articles 8_ and _9_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_
, _(vii)_ or _(viii)_.

 



 

9.2. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each party to
this Agreement shall pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees and
expenses of its legal, accounting and financial advisors.

 



 

9.3. _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall be
construed under and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to the conflicts of law principles of any jurisdiction. Any action
brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be brought in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, assuming that such Court has jurisdiction of such
matter, and to any other federal or state court in the State of Delaware if
the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, and the parties hereto
hereby consent to the jurisdiction of such courts; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event an action is brought by the Purchaser Group to enforce its
indemnification rights under _Article 8_ of this Agreement for a matter for
which the ITW Purchase Agreement Purchaser Group is entitled to seek
indemnification from ITW Parent pursuant to Article 8 of the ITW Purchase
Agreement (including, but not limited to, any action brought by the Purchaser
Group to enforce its indemnification rights under _Section 8.2(b)_ of this
Agreement), such action shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, be brought in such court in which the ITW Purchase Agreement Purchaser
Group is required or permitted to bring an action to enforce its
indemnification rights under Article 8 of the ITW Purchase Agreement. TO THE
FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING INSTITUTED BY
OR AGAINST IT IN RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

and exhibits, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and
supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations and understandings relating to
the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral (including any letter of
intent, term sheet, or memorandum of understanding). This Agreement may not be
amended, altered, enlarged, supplemented, abridged, modified, or any
provisions waived, except by a writing duly signed by the party to be bound
thereby. In addition, the parties acknowledge and agree that they shall not
modify the terms of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement without the prior approval of the FTC, except as otherwise provided
in Rule 2.41(f)(5) of the FTCs Rules of Practice and Procedure, 16 C.F.R. §
241(f)(5).

 



 

9.6. _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the party waiving the term or condition. No waiver by any
party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

 



 

9.7. _Benefit; Assignability_. This Agreement is enforceable by, and inures to
the benefit of, the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors
and assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation
under this Agreement may be assigned by any party to this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempt to do so
shall be void; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or
any Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder (i)
to one or more of its Affiliates, (ii) for collateral security purposes to any
lender providing financing to Purchaser Parent or its Affiliates and any such
lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of Purchasers hereunder,
and (iii) to any subsequent purchaser of Purchaser Parent, US Purchaser or any
Purchaser or any material portion of their respective assets (whether such
sale is structured as a sale of stock or membership interests, a sale of
assets, a merger or otherwise).

 



 

9.8. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and delivered via facsimile or other form of electronic
transmission (including .pdf transmission), each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall constitute one agreement.

 



 

9.9. _Publicity and Disclosures_. Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser Parent
may be required to file this Agreement and related disclosures with the FTC,
the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Purchasers acknowledge that Graco may
be required to file this Agreement and related disclosures with the FTC, the
SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. The parties hereby agree to seek
confidential treatment of any information contained in any document filed with
the SEC, as reasonably requested by any party.

 



 

9.10. _No Third-Party Rights; Interplay with Final Order_. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor may
be construed, to confer upon or give any Person, other than the parties hereto
and the Persons entitled to indemnification under _Article 8_, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Graco affirms that this Agreement, upon the approval of the FTC, shall
constitute the Divestiture Agreement under and as defined in the Final Order
and, as provided in the Final Order, Gracos failure to comply with the terms
of this Agreement shall constitute Gracos failure to comply with the Final
Order.

 



 

9.11. _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the Articles and Sections of
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part
of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

9.12. _Remedies_. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided in this
Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive and are in addition to any and all
rights, remedies, powers and privileges granted by law, rule, regulation or
instrument. The parties agree that, in addition to any other relief afforded
under the terms of this Agreement or by Applicable Law, the parties may
enforce this Agreement by equitable relief (including, but not limited to,
injunctive or mandatory relief) to be issued by or against the other parties,
it being understood that both Damages and specific performance shall be proper
modes of relief and are not to be understood as alternative remedies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Graco shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, enforce _Section 6.2(d)(iii)_ by seeking equitable relief following
the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date (it being acknowledged and agreed

be given or undertaken under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Seller

Guaranteed Obligations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations and
liability of Graco under this _Section 9.17_ shall be subject to the same

expressed to be given or undertaken under this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations_ "), and (ii) shall indemnify the Seller
Group and hold the Seller Group harmless against any Damages which the Seller
Group

failure to perform any such Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations or enforcing this
_Section 9.18_.

 



 

(b) The guarantee provided by Purchaser Parent in this _Section 9.18_ shall
be a continuing guarantee, shall be independent of any other remedy any Seller
may have to enforce the Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations, and shall be
operative and binding notwithstanding that at any time or times the Purchaser
Guaranteed Obligations shall cease or terminate, and the guarantee herein
provided will not be considered as wholly or partially satisfied by the
intermediate payment or satisfaction at any time of all or any part of the
Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations. The liability of Purchaser Parent under this
_Section 9.18_ will not be discharged, diminished or in any way affected by
any circumstance which might otherwise constitute, in whole or in part, a
defense available to, or a discharge of, any Purchaser in respect of the
Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
obligations and liability of Purchaser Parent under this _Section 9.18_ shall
