Bonus Payments, the amount to be paid to each such individual net of all
applicable withholding amounts and payroll taxes, and the employer portion of

 (v) If there are one (1) or more Non-Executing VRP Participants, deposit the sum equal to the aggregate amount(s) determined in good faith by the Sellers to be due and payable to such Non-Executing VRP Participant(s) under the VRP (such aggregate amount(s), the " _VRP Holdback Amount_ ") into an interest bearing escrow (the " _VRP Escrow_ ") held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The VRP Escrow shall be held, maintained and disbursed by the Escrow Agent and shall serve as a source of funds for payment to any such Non-Executing VRP Participants. To the extent that Buyer or the Company suffer or incur any Losses as a result of or relating to claims of the Non-Executing VRP Participants under the VRP in addition to the VRP Holdback Amount, then such Losses shall be payable from the Holdback Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholders shall restore all such payments in excess of the VRP Holdback Amount to the Holdback Amount pursuant to the provisions of _Section 7.7_.

Such certificate shall also contain wire instructions for all of the forgoing payments (or instructions to pay certain amounts by check) and all of the other payments referenced in _Section 2.3_. Sellers agree to use their best efforts to pay all Seller Transaction Costs before the Closing in order to limit to the greatest extent possible the amount of any Seller Transaction Costs to be paid at or after the Closing. Within thirty (30) days of notification from Buyer (which notification shall include copies of invoices or such other reasonable detail of the applicable Seller Transaction Costs), the Stockholders shall reimburse Buyer for any and all Seller Transaction Costs paid by Buyer after the Closing.

Sheet (the " _Estimated Balance Sheet_ ") reasonably acceptable to Buyer,
which will be prepared in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_ and in reasonable
detail and accompanied by such financial information and methods of
calculation as may reasonably be necessary for Buyer to understand the
calculations included therewith. For purposes of calculating the Closing
Payment, included with the Estimated Balance Sheet will be calculations of
the Estimated Tangible Net Book Value, Estimated Cash Balances and Estimated
Debt. The Purchase Price will be reduced at the Closing by the amount of
Estimated Debt and will be increased or decreased, as the case may be, on a
dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent the Estimated Tangible Net Book Value is
greater or less than the Target Tangible Net Book Value; _provided_ ,
_however_ , an increase in the Closing Payment attributable to Estimated
Tangible Net Book Value exceeding Target Tangible Net Book Value shall not
exceed the amount of the Estimated Cash Balances. The net adjustment to
the Closing Payment arising from the Estimated Debt, Estimated Tangible Net
Book Value and Estimated Cash shall be referred to herein as the " _Estimated
Purchase Price Adjustment_." 

   

 (b) Within 150 days after the Closing, Buyer will furnish the Stockholder Representative with a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") prepared by Buyer, which will be in reasonable detail and accompanied by such other financial information and methods of calculation as may be reasonably necessary for the Stockholder Representative to evaluate the accuracy thereof. The Closing Balance Sheet will (i) be prepared by Buyer in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with the Company audited financial statements as of September 30, 2005; (ii) be based solely on transactions arising or resulting solely from the operation of the Companys business and will not include any amounts arising from Buyers acquisition of the Company (including, without limitation, any amounts paid by Buyer to or on behalf of the Sellers on or before the Closing, any Taxes resulting from this transaction, any Seller Transaction Costs, any VRP Termination Payments, any Special Closing Bonus Payments and any Holdback Amounts); (iii) exclude any assets that have been or will be assigned or distributed to the Stockholders in connection with this transaction; (iv) exclude any accounts receivable billed as of the Closing Date but not collected within 150 days after the Closing Date (the " _Uncollected A/R_ "); and (v) exclude Taxes other than Ordinary Course Taxes. The Closing Balance Sheet also will set forth the calculation of Closing Tangible Net Book Value, Closing Cash Balances, Closing Debt, and if applicable, the " _Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_ ," which shall mean the amount obtained employing the same methodology as used to determine the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment, but using Closing Debt, Closing Tangible Net Book Value and Closing Cash amounts rather than Estimated Debt, Estimated Tangible Net Book Value and Estimated Cash amounts. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish the Closing Balance Sheet as soon as practicable within such 150-day period after the Closing, but in the event Buyer, using such efforts, is not able to furnish the Closing Balance Sheet within such period, the Parties agree that the time period for delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet shall be extended to the extent reasonably necessary for (i) Buyer to determine the proper amount of any asset or liability of the Company that may not have been correctly recorded by the Company in past periods and (ii) Buyer to obtain and incorporate into the Closing Balance Sheet such information from the Stockholder Representative as may be reasonably necessary to complete the Closing Balance Sheet, which information shall be furnished in a timely manner. Buyer will notify the Stockholder Representative in writing as soon as reasonably practicable if it determines that it will not be able to furnish the Closing Balance Sheet within such 150-day period and will include in such notice a list of all information required from the Stockholder Representative as may be reasonably

necessary to complete the Closing Balance Sheet. With respect to any failure
to timely provide the Closing Balance Sheet to the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholders will receive only actual damages (if any)
caused by such failure. Buyer shall cooperate with the
Stockholder Representative in furnishing information, documents and such
other assistance as is reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative
to facilitate its review of the Closing Balance Sheet. The Stockholder
Representative will have a period of forty-five (45) days after receipt of
the Closing Balance Sheet to notify Buyer in writing of their election to
accept or reject (and in the case of a rejection, there must be included in
such notice the reasons for rejection in reasonable detail) the Closing
Balance Sheet and any Closing Purchase Price Adjustment determined
therefrom. In the event no written notice is received by Buyer during such
forty-five (45)-day period, Buyers calculation of Closing Tangible Net Book
Value, Closing Cash Balances, Closing Debt, and any Closing Purchase Price
Adjustment will be deemed accepted by the Stockholder Representative
and final and binding on the parties hereto. In the event that any document
or action required to be delivered or taken by the Stockholder Representative
as a prerequisite to the delivery of a report on the Closing Balance Sheet is
not timely delivered or taken, such failure shall be deemed to be a rejection
of the Closing Balance Sheet by the Stockholder Representative and the
provisions of  _Section 2.4(c)_ shall apply. 

   

 (c) In the event the Stockholder Representative timely and duly rejects Buyers Closing Balance Sheet and any Closing Purchase Price Adjustment, Buyer and the Stockholder Representative will promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) days following the date upon which the Stockholder Representative rejects Buyers Closing Balance Sheet) attempt to make a joint determination of the Closing Balance Sheet and any Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. If the Stockholder Representative and Buyer are able to jointly determine the Closing Balance Sheet, any Closing Purchase Price Adjustment amount resulting therefrom will be made immediately after such determination and will be final and binding on the parties hereto. If the parties are unable to agree upon the final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet within such twenty (20)-day period, then Buyer and the Stockholder Representative will submit the issues in dispute to the Arbitrator, who will act as the sole arbitrator of the issues in dispute. The determination by the Arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. The Arbitrator, in the Arbitrators sole discretion, will allocate the fees and expenses of the accountants and the Arbitrator to the Stockholders and Buyer. 

  

 (d) To the extent the amount of the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment is different than the amount of the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment (determined in accordance with either _Section 2.4(b)_ or _Section 2.4(c)_, as the case may be), then either the Buyer shall pay or refund the Stockholders or the Stockholders, on a pro rata basis, shall pay or refund the Buyer, as the case may be, such amount as is necessary to cause the amount by which the Closing Payment was adjusted using the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment to equal the amount by which the Closing Payment would have been adjusted using the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. By way of example, if the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment resulted in a decrease of the Closing Payment by $500,000 and use of the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment rather than the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment would have resulted in an increase of the Closing Payment by $1,000,000, then the Buyer shall pay the Stockholders an amount equal to $1,500,000 pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_. In addition, within thirty (30) days of notification from Buyer (which notification shall include copies of invoices or such other reasonable detail of the applicable Seller Transaction Costs), the Stockholders shall reimburse Buyer for any and all

excess of [*] Dollars ($[*]) payable by the Stockholders in the aggregate
under this _Section 2.4(d)_ shall be paid by the Stockholders to the Buyer
in accordance with _Section 2.4(e)_. 

   

 (e) Any amounts required to be paid by one party to the other pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_ shall be treated as a Purchase Price Adjustment. Any payments due to Buyer pursuant to  _Section 2.4(d)_ shall be paid out of the Holdback Amount and/or by the Stockholders, as applicable, to Buyer in immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after final determination of the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. Any payments due to the Stockholders shall be paid by Buyer to the Stockholders in immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after final determination of the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment in accordance with each Stockholders Pro Rata Portion. 

  

 (f) In the event that the Closing is to occur on other than a month-end, the Buyer and the Stockholders shall in good faith attempt to agree on reasonable mid-month closing accounting procedures and conventions. 

  

 (g) Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the Stockholders such amounts as Buyer or the Company is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Buyer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholders in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company.

 3.14 _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) Since October 1, 1994, the Company is and has been and will be at all times through the Closing Date, an "S" corporation within the meaning of Section 1361(a) of the Code and within the meaning of analogous state or local provisions in the jurisdictions set forth on _Schedule 3.14(a)_ except to the extent that the "S" status of the Company is terminated as a result of the purchase of Shares or the Section 338(h)(10) Election contemplated by this Agreement. Other than in connection with this Share purchase, none of the Sellers has taken or omitted or caused to be taken or omitted to take any actions which could cause the Company to cease to be treated as an "S" corporation for federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes.

Tax deficiency has been proposed or assessed against the Company and the
Company has not executed any waiver of any statute of limitations on the
assessment or collection of any Tax, which Tax has not been paid. No Tax
audit, action, suit, proceeding, investigation, or claim is now pending or,
to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened against the Company, and, within the
past three years, no issue has been raised in writing to the Company in any
examination by a taxing authority with regard to any income or any material
non-income Taxes which is expected to result in the assertion of a Tax
deficiency against the Company for any Tax periods ending after the Closing
Date. The Company has complied in all material respects with all applicable
Laws related to the withholding of Taxes except to the extent that such
failure to file or pay is covered by a reserve on the Financial Statements or
is reflected in the liabilities set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (c) To the extent required by GAAP, the most recent audited Financial Statements for the Company reflect an adequate reserve, established in accordance with GAAP, for all Tax Liabilities of the Company for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such Financial Statements, and, since the date of the Financial Statements, there has not been any material change in the tax accounting methods followed by the Sellers in respect of the Company (other than such changes that have been required by Law or GAAP or that have been caused by the purchase of Company Shares or the Section 338(h)(10) Election contemplated by this Agreement), and in the case of Taxes owed as of the date hereof, to the extent required by GAAP an adequate reserve is (and until the Closing Date will continue to be) reflected in the accruals for Taxes payable on the most recent balance sheets of the Company assuming such reserve is adjusted for the passage of time and in accordance with past custom and practice of the Company, other than accruals established to reflect timing differences and accruals reflected only in the notes thereto. 

  

 (d) _Schedule 3.14(d)_ lists each state, local, county, municipal or foreign jurisdiction in which the Company files or is or has been determined by any Governmental Body to be required to file a Tax Return or is or has been determined by a Governmental Body to be liable for any Tax on a "nexus" basis at any time for a taxable period for which the statute of limitations has not expired. 

  

 (e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(e)_, or to the extent reflected in the Financial Statements or the Closing Balance Sheet, (1) no claim in writing has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is subject to taxation by that jurisdiction; (2) there are no Liens on any assets of the Company that arose in connection with any failure to pay any Tax required to have been paid; (3) the Company is not a party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement relating to Taxes imposed on a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar basis on members of a group of entities that include the Company; (4) the Company (x) has not been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return or (y) is not liable for the Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise; (5) the Company will not be required to include any item of income in (or with respect to clause (ii) below, exclude any item of deduction from) taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in

_Bishop Employment Agreement_ "), or the transactions contemplated hereby,
that such Stockholder may now have or may hereafter claim to have against the

Buyer to the Stockholders under this Agreement or any other Buyer Document

any accrued employee benefits (other than any salary, bonus or payment under
the VRP) included on the Closing Balance Sheet, and (ii) obligations accruing
after Closing that solely arise or result from such post-Closing employment.
In furtherance of the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the Company

will be terminated at the Closing and of no further force or effect. 

   

 5.14 _Accounts Receivable_.

Further, to the extent that any unbilled accounts receivable that were included on the Closing Balance Sheet, but have not been collected by the date that is twenty four (24) months after the Closing Date, then the Stockholders shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the aggregate face amount of uncollected unbilled accounts receivable in excess of any reserves for uncollectible unbilled accounts receivable on the Closing Balance Sheet as soon as reasonably practicable therafter. 

  

 5.15 _Company 401(k) Plan_. Prior to the Closing, the Company will cause its Board of Directors to adopt resolutions to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, contingent upon the Closing. Following the date of such termination, no contributions will be made to the Company 401(k) Plan other than contributions that have been accrued on behalf of participants prior to the termination or are otherwise based on compensation earned before the termination. Such resolutions will provide (to the extent required under Section 411 of the Code) that all participants be fully vested in their account balances under the Company 401(k) Plan. Such resolutions will also authorize distributions of Company 401(k) Plan balances to participants as soon as practicable following the receipt of a favorable determination letter from IRS covering the termination.

Notwithstanding any investigation or contrary knowledge by Buyer, the representations and warranties of Sellers and Buyer made in or pursuant to this Agreement and the other documents delivered at the Closing, and the respective parties indemnification obligations with respect thereto, will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement until the [*] year anniversary of the Closing Date, except for the representations and warranties set forth in (a) [*] and the indemnification obligations with respect thereto, which will survive until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable period of limitations, and (b) [*] and the indemnification obligations with respect thereto, which will survive indefinitely. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representation or warranty the violation of which is made the basis of a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ will survive until such claim is finally resolved if the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party of such claim in reasonable detail prior to the date on which such representation or warranty and the respective indemnification obligation would otherwise expire under this Agreement. 

  

 7.5 _Notice_. Any party entitled to receive indemnification under this _Article VII_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt written notice to the party or parties required to provide such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") upon the occurrence of any identifiable Loss or the assertion of any claim (including, without limitation, any Asserted Tax Claim) or the commencement of any action or proceeding or Tax or other government audit or investigation in respect of which such a Loss may reasonably be expected to occur (a " _Claim_ "), but the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice will not affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under this _Article VII_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Parties are prejudiced thereby. Such written notice will include a reference to the event or events forming the basis of such Loss or Claim and the amount involved, unless such amount is uncertain or contingent, in which event the Indemnified Party will give a later written notice when the amount becomes fixed. 

  

 7.6 _Defense of Claims_. The Indemnifying Parties may elect to assume and control the defense of any Claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of expenses related to such Claim, if (a) the Indemnifying Parties acknowledge their obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Losses resulting from such Claim and provide reasonable evidence to the Indemnified Party of its financial ability to satisfy such obligation; (b) the Claim does not seek to impose any Liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party other than for money damages; and (c) the Claim does not or could not reasonably be expect to adversely affect the Indemnified Partys relationship with its customers or employees (other than any Claim for Sales Taxes that relate to the Indemnified Partys relationship with a Governmental Body as its customer, in which case any election to control the defense of such Claim shall constitute an election for joint control with the Indemnified Party).

If such conditions are satisfied and the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume
and control the defense of a Claim, then (i) the Indemnifying Parties will
not be liable for any settlement of such Claim effected without their
consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; (ii)
the Indemnifying Parties may settle such Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party; and (iii) the Indemnified Party may employ separate
counsel and participate in the defense of such Claim, but the Indemnified
Party will be responsible for the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (A)
the Indemnifying Parties have failed to adequately assume the defense of such
Claim or to employ counsel with respect thereto or (B) there is a conflict of
interest (as reasonably determined in writing by counsel to the Indemnified
Party) between the interests of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Parties that requires representation by separate counsel, in which case the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Indemnifying
Parties, provided that in no event will the Indemnifying Parties be required
to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnified
Party with respect to any Claim. If such conditions are not satisfied, the
Indemnified Party may assume and control the defense of the Claim; provided,
however, that if the Indemnifying Party is not permitted to assume and
control the defense of the Claim as a result of subsection (c) to this
_Section 7.6_, then the Indemnified Party shall not settle any such Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

   

 7.7 _Holdback Amount; Right of Setoff_. All finally determined due and owing Claims Buyer has under this _Article VII_ will first be deducted from the Holdback Amount and distributed to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. To the extent the amount owed to Buyer for a Claim is more than the remaining Holdback Amount, the Stockholders, on a pro rata basis, will pay the balance of such Claim to Buyer in immediately available funds within ten (10) days after final determination of the amount due. In addition, and for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Stockholders have any payment obligations to Buyer arising under this Agreement that the Stockholders fail to pay in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then, upon Buyers request, such unpaid amounts will be withdrawn from the Holdback Amount and distributed to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement but at no time shall any amounts be released from the Escrow unless agreed by both parties. The Escrow Agent will promptly provide written notice of any such distribution to the Stockholder Representative and, with respect to all payment obligations arising under _Articles II_ (except for Tax Deposits) and _Sections 5.9, 5.12, 8.1(a), 8.1(b) and 8.7(c)_, the Stockholders will pay the amount of any such distribution to the Escrow Agent for addition to the Holdback Amount in immediately available funds within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice: provided, however, that such payment to the Escrow shall not be required until the aggregate amount required to be paid to the Escrow exceeds $*, and then only to the extent that such required payments exceed $*. For the avoidance of doubt, no Claims will be made against the Tax Deposit, which will be paid either to the IRS or to the Stockholders in accordance with the written instruction of the Stockholder Representative. 

  

 7.8 _Insurance Recoveries_. If any Loss related to a claim by an Indemnified Party is covered by one or more third party insurance policies held by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party actually receives a full or partial recovery under such insurance policies, the Indemnified Party shall refund amounts received from the Indemnifying Party up to the amount of indemnification actually received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Loss to the extent the Indemnified Party receives any insurance payment under such third party insurance with

respect to such Loss (net of (i) any costs of collecting such insurance
payment, including the amount of any co-payment or deductible; (ii) an amount
equal to the amount of Loss for which indemnification was not received by
reason of the application of _Section 7.3(a)_; and (iii) that portion of any
premium increase in the next policy period of the applicable insurance
policy or replacement insurance policy that results directly from the
assertion of such claim, as determined by correspondence from the insurance
carrier or insurance broker to the Indemnified Party, a copy which shall have
been provided to the Indemnifying Party); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
existence of an insurance claim does not require an Indemnified Party
to pursue an insurance claim prior to making an indemnification claim under
this _Article VII_. 

   

 7.9 _Mitigation_. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, to the extent reasonably practicable (including, without limitation, pursuing available claims for insurance), any indemnifiable Losses upon and after the conscious awareness of such Indemnified Party or the executive officers of such Indemnified Party of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the existence of mitigation does not require an Indemnified Party to pursue such mitigation prior to making an indemnification claim under this _Article VII_ 

  

 7.10 _Certain Damages_. An Indemnifying Party shall in no event be liable to any Indemnified Party for any exemplary or punitive damages, provided that any damages required to be paid by a Buyer Indemnified Party to any third party that is not an Affiliate of a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to a final judgment or order of a court of competent jurisdiction arising out of a Claim may be considered direct damages to the Buyer Indemnified Party, and may constitute Losses for purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, the Stockholders shall in no event be liable to any Buyer Party for any consequential damages from a breach of any representation or warranty occurring during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date if such breach is disclosed to Buyer in writing prior to the Closing. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 Tax Matters 

   

 8.1 _Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) _Tax Periods Ending On or Before the Closing Date_. The Company or, following the Closing, the Stockholders, on behalf of the Company, shall timely file (including without limitation extensions of time to file) all federal, state, local and other Tax Returns for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and have paid or will pay all Taxes attributable to such periods (the " _Short Period Returns_ "). Such returns will be prepared and filed in accordance with applicable Laws and in a manner consistent with past practices of the Company. Prior to filing any Short Period income Tax Return after the Closing Date, Argy, Wiltse and Robinson, P.C. (" _AWR_ ") shall provide a letter to Buyer indicating that AWR has examined the Tax Return, including accompanying schedules and statements, and the Return is based on all information of which AWR has any knowledge, and to the best of AWRs knowledge and belief, the Return is true, correct, and complete in all material respects. Prior to filing any Short Period non-income Tax Return after the Closing Date, the Stockholders shall provide such Tax Returns to the Buyer at least fifteen (15) days prior to their due date (taking into account extensions) for the Buyers review and comment. The Buyer shall have seven (7)

 **EXECUTION COPY**  

      

Business Days to comment on each non-income Tax Return described in this
_Section 8.1(a)_. The Stockholders shall make such revisions to any such
non-income Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date as are reasonably
requested by Buyer to ensure that such returns have been prepared in a manner
consistent with the past reporting practices of the Company and in accordance
with applicable Law. For this purpose, Buyers comments shall be deemed
reasonable if (x) the Stockholders agree to them, (y) in the written opinion
of an Independent Accounting Firm, the reporting position initially proposed
by Stockholders is not "more likely than not" to prevail, as defined in
Treas. Reg. Section 1.6662-4(d)(2) and the alternative reporting position
proposed by Buyer is "more likely than not" to prevail, or (z) in the
written opinion of an Independent Accounting Firm, the reporting positions
proposed by the Stockholders and Buyer are both "more likely than not" to
prevail, and the position proposed by Buyer is consistent with past practice
(it being understood that such standard shall be applied for purposes of
this  _Section 8.1_ whether or not the underlying Tax Return is a Tax Return
with respect to income Taxes). Buyer shall reimburse the Stockholders for any
Taxes of the Company or the Stockholders for which Buyer has an
indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_ of this Agreement
within fifteen (15) Business Days after payment of such Taxes by the Company
or the Stockholders. 

   

 (b) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. Buyer shall file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company for tax periods that begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ " and such Tax Returns, a " _Straddle Period Return_ ") and pay all Taxes owed by the Company for such periods. Prior to filing any Straddle Period Return, Buyer shall provide the Stockholder Representative with copies of such Tax Returns at least fifteen (15) days prior to their due date (taking into account extensions) for the Stockholder Representatives review and comment. The Stockholder Representative shall have seven (7) Business Days to comment on each Tax Return described in this  _Section 8.1(b)_. Buyer shall make such revisions to any such Tax Returns filed for the Straddle Period as are reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative to ensure that such returns have been prepared in a manner consistent with the past reporting practices of the Company and in accordance with applicable Law. For this purpose, the Stockholder Representatives comments shall be deemed reasonable if (x) Buyer agrees to them, (y) in the written opinion of an Independent Accounting Firm, the reporting position initially proposed by Buyer is not "more likely than not" to prevail, as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.6662-4(d)(2) and the alternative reporting position proposed by the Stockholders Representative is "more likely than not" to prevail, or (z) in the written opinion of an Independent Accounting Firm, the reporting positions proposed by the Stockholder Representative and Buyer are both "more likely than not" to prevail, and the position proposed by the Stockholder Representative is consistent with past practice. The Stockholders shall reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the Company or the Buyer for which the Stockholders have an indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ of this Agreement within fifteen (15) Business Days after payment of such Taxes by the Company or Buyer. 

  

 (c) _Tax Allocation_. For purposes of this Agreement and subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ , in the case of any Taxes that are payable by the Company for any Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax payable by the Company which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or

related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and
(ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be
equal to the amount which would be payable by the Company if the relevant
taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to
give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent
with prior practice of the Company (taking into account the Tax status of
the Company for such period, including its S corporation status for federal
income tax purposes and any similar status for other Tax purposes). 

   

 (d) _Amended Tax Returns_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Tax Return or amended Tax Return shall be filed (and waiver or extension of the statute of limitations for filing such returns or assessing Taxes and no election shall otherwise be made) with respect to any taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Periods_ ") without the consent of the Stockholders. 

  

 8.2 _Certain Contest Rights_. 

  

 (a) Promptly after receipt by Buyer, the Company or the Stockholders of a written notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that, either at such time or after the lapse of time, might give rise to an adjustment or audit of any Tax Return of the Company for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (" _Stockholder Returns_ "), or Straddle Period Returns, the party receiving such notice shall in turn provide notice (the " _Tax Claim Notice_ ") to the other parties hereunder. The Tax Claim Notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to the party receiving the inquiry or notice from the taxing authority) describing such demand, claim or circumstance, including any asserted tax liability (an " _Asserted Tax Claim_ ") in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received in respect of any such Asserted Tax Claim. 

  

 (b) Subject to the Buyers right to participate in any tax proceeding as described below, the Stockholders, at their own cost and expense, shall have the power and authority to control the conduct of the Company in respect of any audit or investigation relating to the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including without limitation any Asserted Tax Claim, to the extent it relates to any Pre-Closing Period Taxes with respect to which the Stockholders have an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall have the right to participate in any such Asserted Tax Claim proceedings, such as a tax audit, examination, appeal or litigation (collectively, a " _Asserted Tax Claim Proceeding_ ") at its expense, if the resolution of the matter at issue in such tax proceeding could materially adversely affect the Company with respect to any period after the Closing. In no event shall the Stockholders settle any such tax proceeding without Buyers consent (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld) if such settlement could materially adversely affect the Company with respect to any period after the Closing or could reasonably be expected to result in any material Liability on the part of the Company or such successor in interest for which the Stockholders are not obligated to indemnify the Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.1_ of this Agreement. In the event the Stockholders determine not to challenge an Asserted Tax Claim, to the extent such Claim could have a material adverse effect on the Company with respect to any period after the Closing, the Buyer shall have the right to assume the powers and authority listed in this _Section 8.2(b)_.

Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, then in no event shall
Buyer or, after the Closing Date, the Company, settle any audit or
investigation relating to Pre-Closing Period Taxes in a manner which could
reasonably be expected to cause any Stockholder to incur a liability (by
virtue of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement or otherwise)
unless the Stockholders provide prior written consent (which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld). In the event that the terms of  _Section
8.2(a)_ or this _Section 8.2(b)_ are inconsistent with the terms of 
_Section 7.6_ hereof, the terms of _Section 8.2(a)_ and this _Section
8.2(b)_ shall control. 

   

 (c) Except as provided below, Buyer and the Stockholders, each at their own cost and expense, shall have the right to jointly control the conduct of the Company in respect of any audit or investigation relating to a Straddle Period Tax Return. Buyer and the Stockholders shall jointly participate in any Asserted Tax Claim Proceedings relating to a Straddle Period Tax Return. In the event the Buyer and the Stockholders cannot agree on the resolution of an issue relating to a Straddle Period Tax Return, then the party (Buyer or the Stockholders, as the case may be) that has the greater Tax obligation with respect to such Straddle Period Return shall have the right to control the resolution of such issue (including a settlement of such issue), but only with the consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 8.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. After the Closing Date, Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand, will cooperate with one another and each shall make available to the other, as reasonably requested in writing, all information, records or documents relating to the payment of any Taxes in accordance with this Agreement, and the conduct of any Tax audit or other litigation involving Taxes for all periods prior to or including the Closing Date and all Straddle Periods and will preserve such information, records or documents until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent contemplated in this Agreement, the Stockholders shall not cause the Company to make any additional federal tax elections under the Code with respect to the Company for any tax period ending after the Closing Date. The cooperation contemplated hereunder shall include providing, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information relating to the Company (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return. Buyer shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Company until the applicable period for assessment under applicable law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer shall cause the Company to give the Stockholders reasonable notice prior to transferring, discarding or destroying any such books and records relating to Tax matters and, if any Stockholder so requests, the Company shall allow the Stockholder to take possession of such books and records. Buyer shall cooperate with the Stockholders in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes involving the Company for any Pre-Closing Period. 

  

 8.4 _Employment Taxes_. Any payment made pursuant to the VRP in accordance with  _Section 2.3(b)(iii)_ will be treated as made by the Company to the participants as compensation for past services and will be subject to applicable employment Taxes including, without limitation, withholding, FUTA and FICA Taxes. The full amount of any such required

employment Taxes shall be paid by the Stockholders to the Company at or
immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 8.5 _Refunds_. 

  

 (a) In the event that the Stockholders receive a refund or credit of Tax of the Company for which Buyer or the Company made a payment pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_ of this Agreement, then, within twenty (20) days of receipt, the Stockholders shall pay to Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, the amount of such refund or credit (including any accrued interest paid in respect of such refunded Tax) to the extent the refund or credit represents payments made by or for Buyer with respect to its obligations under _Section 7.2(c)_. Buyer agrees that as a condition to receiving any such refund or credit, in the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been made to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ is subsequently reduced or disallowed, to indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders for any Tax liability assessed against such Stockholder by reason of the reduction or disallowance. 

  

 (b) In the event that Buyer or the Company receives a refund or credit of Tax or receives any reimbursements from customers of Sales Taxes of the Company and such items relate to any Pre-Closing Period or to any Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, then, within twenty (20) days of receipt, Buyer shall pay to the Stockholders, the amount of such refund, credit or reimbursement (including any accrued interest paid in respect of such amounts). Upon repayment to the Company of the amount of Section 7519 Taxes earlier paid by the Company to the IRS, the Company shall promptly pay such amount to the Stockholder Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "refund" shall mean the receipt of cash, an actual reduction in tax paid and the use of an overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset by Buyer or the Company. 

  

 8.6 _FIRPTA Certificate_. At the Closing, (a) the Company shall deliver to Buyer a statement (in such form as may be reasonably requested by counsel to Buyer) conforming to the requirements of Treas. Reg. §§ 1.897-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h) of the United States Treasury Regulations and (b) the Company shall deliver to Buyer a letter authorizing Buyer to deliver on behalf of the Company the notification required under Section 1.897-2(h)(2) of the United States Treasury Regulations. 

  

 8.7 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. 

  

 (a) The Stockholders shall join with Buyer in making the elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or any analogous provision of state or local Law (each such election, a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "), with respect to Buyers purchase of all of the capital stock of the Company. The Stockholders agree to take, or cause to be taken, any and all action necessary and to do, or cause to be done, or to execute, or cause to be executed, such documents as may be necessary or desirable to effect any Section 338(h)(10) Election, with respect to Buyers acquisition of all the capital stock of the Company. At the Closing, the parties shall execute IRS Form 8023 (or any successor form(s) thereto), with all attachments. 

  

 (b) Buyer and Sellers agree that the Purchase Price will be allocated to the assets of the Company in accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the regulations

thereunder. Within fifteen (15) days after the final determination of the
Closing Balance Sheet, the parties shall retain the Independent Accounting
Firm to prepare a final schedule (the " _Final Allocation Schedule_ ")
allocating the Purchase Price among the assets of the Company. The Final
Allocation Schedule shall be an allocation of the Purchase Price among the
assets of the Company in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of
the Code and the regulations thereunder. Buyer and the Stockholders will
cooperate and Buyer shall cause the Company to cooperate, to provide
the Independent Accounting Firm with such information within Buyers, the
Stockholders or the Companys possession that may be reasonably requested in
writing by such Independent Accounting Firm for purposes of its evaluation
hereunder. The Independent Accounting Firm will keep confidential all
information disclosed by Buyer, the Stockholders and the Company in the course
of conducting its evaluation, and, to that end, will execute such customary
documentation as the parties may reasonably request with respect to such
confidentiality obligation. Buyer and the Stockholders shall have full access
to the Independent Accounting Firm and shall be entitled to submit
information to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting
Firm will be directed to comply with the provisions of this _Section
8.7(b)_, and to that end each of Buyer and Sellers will provide the
Independent Accounting Firm with a complete and correct copy of this _Section
8.7(b)_ (and the definitions of capitalized terms used in this _Section
8.7(b)_ that are defined elsewhere in this Agreement). Buyer and Sellers
shall be bound by the determination by the Independent Accounting Firm,
absent manifest error. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that,
upon termination of the Escrow Agreement, the Final Allocation Schedule shall
be revised consistent with the applicable provisions of the Code and Treasury
Regulations. Buyer and Sellers shall file all Tax Returns (including amended
returns and claims for refund), IRS Form 8883 and any information reports in
a manner consistent therewith. The cost of engaging the Independent Accounting
Firm for purposes of preparing the Final Allocation Schedule shall be borne
by Buyer to the extent such costs are incurred in periods after the execution
of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the Stockholders may retain
the Independent Accounting Firm, at their own cost and expense, to prepare a
preliminary schedule allocating the Purchase Price among the assets of the
Company in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder. 

   

 (c) Each Stockholder shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on his tax returns to the extent required by applicable Law. Each Stockholder shall also pay any Tax imposed on the Company attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including any Tax imposed under Section 1374 of the Code or the failure of any jurisdiction to conform to federal income Tax treatment for the Section 338(h)(10) Election. 

  

 8.8 _S Corporation Status_. Neither the Company nor the Stockholders shall revoke the Companys election to be taxed as an S corporation for purposes of federal or any applicable state or local Law within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code and any applicable state or local provision. Furthermore, except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor the Stockholders shall take any or allow any action that would result in the termination of a Companys status as a validly electing S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code and any applicable state or local provision. Buyer acknowledges that the Company shall lose its status as an S Corporation upon the Closing.

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, charges for or in connection with the recording of any instrument or document as provided in this Agreement and any state or local transfer Taxes, if any, arising in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election) payable in connection with the transfer of the Stock as contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by the Stockholders and Buyer. 

  

ARTICLE IX 
 Miscellaneous 

   

 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned (a) at any time prior to the Closing by mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers; (b) except as provided below, by either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, if a condition to performance by either party under this Agreement has not been satisfied or waived prior to the date that is ninety (90) days after the date hereof; (c) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, if a condition to performance by either party under this Agreement has not been satisfied or waived prior to the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the date hereof, or (d) except as provided below, by Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, at any time, if there is pending or threatened litigation in any court or any proceeding before or by any Governmental Body to restrain or prohibit or obtain damages or other relief with respect to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of which Buyer could be required to dispose of any assets or operations of Buyer (including the operations of the Company) or their Affiliates or to comply with any restriction on the manner in which Buyer or their Affiliates conduct their operations (including any operations of the Company); provided, that, except for a termination pursuant to _Section 9.1 (a) or (c)_, (i) Buyer may not terminate this Agreement if the Closing has not occurred because of Buyers failure to perform or observe any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or if Buyer is, at such time, in breach of this Agreement, and such breach constitutes a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ or _Section 6.1(b)_, as the case may be; and (ii) Sellers may not terminate this Agreement if the Closing has not occurred because of Sellers failure to perform or observe any of their respective covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or if either of Sellers is, at such time, in breach of this Agreement, and such breach constitutes a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ , as the case may be.

regard to the limitations set forth in _Article VII_, against any claim for

such partys obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of

 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Legal Process_.

Notwithstanding any provision of the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules, any such arbitration will be conducted before and decided by one arbitrator. The parties to the arbitration will request that the American Arbitration Association provide the parties with a list of five potential arbitrators. Each party will then strike from the list names one after another until one name is left. After the rights to strike are exercised, the individual remaining on the list will be the arbitrator. Any such arbitration will take place in the City of Wilmington, Delaware. The arbitrators in any such arbitration will apply the laws of the State of Delaware and the United States of America.

in the arbitration will be entitled to recover from the other all costs,
fees, and expenses pertaining or attributable to such arbitration, including
reasonable attorneys fees. 

   

 9.15 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement will, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions of this Agreement, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

 (c) Each of the Stockholders appointing the Stockholder Representative hereunder hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that any Person shall be entitled to rely on any and all action taken by the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement without liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the Stockholders. If the Stockholder Representative resigns or ceases to function in such capacity for any reason whatsoever, then the successor Stockholder Representative shall be Richard F. Bishop. The Stockholders appointing the Stockholder Representative do hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless from and against any and all Loss (including without limitation attorneys fees) reasonably incurred or suffered as a result of the performance of such Stockholder Representatives duties under this Agreement, except for any such Loss arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder Representative.
