This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 24,
2011, is entered into by and among CPK Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), CPK Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and California Pizza Kitchen, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Each of Parent, Sub and the Company
are referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and together as " _Parties_."
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set
forth in  _Article X_.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Sub and the
Company have unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders
and (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Parent proposes to cause Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may
be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_
") to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") at a price per share
of Company Common Stock of $18.50, without interest (such amount, or any other
amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer
Price_ "), net to the seller thereof in cash, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Sub to
enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have delivered
to Parent and Sub support agreements (the " _Support Agreements_ "), dated as
of the date hereof, providing that such stockholders of the Company have,
among other things, agreed to (i) tender the shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by them in the Offer, and (ii) support the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, each on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Support Agreements;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the limited guarantee of Golden Gate

hereof, in favor of the Company with respect to certain obligations of Parent
under this Agreement (the " _Limited Guarantee_ ");

 

WHEREAS, regardless of whether the Offer Closing occurs, Sub will merge with
and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation in the merger (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly
provided in _Section 3.01_, each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price; and

 



4 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, as well as other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties
agree as follows:

 

 _ARTICLE I_

 

 _The Offer_

 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. As promptly as reasonably practicable (and,
in any event, within 10 Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the
Offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price (as adjusted as provided in _Section
1.01(c)_, if applicable).

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set
forth in Annex I (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer Conditions are for
the sole benefit of Parent and Sub, and Parent and Sub may waive, in whole or
in part, any Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, in their sole
discretion, other than the Minimum Tender Condition, which may be waived by
Parent and Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company. Parent and
Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price or to waive or
make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or previously
approved by the Company in writing, Sub shall not, and Parent shall
not permit Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock
sought to be purchased in the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change
the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive
the Minimum Tender Condition, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or amend,
modify or supplement any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to any holder of
Company Common Stock, (vi) terminate, extend or otherwise amend or modify the
expiration date of the Offer in any manner other than in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement or (vii) provide any "subsequent offering period"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(c) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including

 



5  any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Subs
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock tendered in
the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the
holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
1.01(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the 20th Business Day
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) (such date being the " _Initial Offer Expiration
Date_ "). Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Sub to) (i) extend the Offer for
any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer and (ii) if any of the Offer Conditions set forth in
clause (b) of Annex I or in paragraph (i) of clause (d) of Annex I shall not
have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Sub, waived,
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to
ten (10) Business Days each, with the length of such period to be determined
by Parent or Sub (or such longer period as the Parties hereto may agree),
until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied. Sub may, in its sole
discretion, without consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more
occasions, in consecutive increments of between two (2) and ten (10) Business
Days each, with the length of such period to be determined by Parent or Sub
(or such other period as the Parties hereto may agree), if on any then-
scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not
have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Sub, waived.
Parent and Sub agree that, if on any then-scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, but subject to Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01, any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or,
to the extent waivable by Parent or Sub, waived, then to the extent requested
in writing by the Company delivered to Parent no less than one (1) Business
Day prior to such expiration date, Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Sub to)
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to
five (5) Business Days each, with the length of such period to be determined
by Parent or Sub (or such longer period as the Parties hereto may agree), for
an aggregate period of time of not more than ten (10) Business Days.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.01(d)_, Sub shall
not be required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (i) the
valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 9.01, (ii)
three (3) Business Days after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date and (iii) the
Outside Date.

 

(e) _Payment_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, accept for payment,
and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the applicable expiration date
of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with  _Section 1.01(d)_)
and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act. The date of payment for shares of Company Common Stock accepted
for payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer
is referred to in this Agreement as

 



6  the " _Offer Closing_ ", and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_ " .

 

(f) _Termination of the Offer; Continuing Pursuit of the Merger_. If at any
then-scheduled expiration date (i) any Offer Condition shall not have been
satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Sub, waived and (ii) three
(3) Business Days have elapsed since the Proxy Statement Clearance Date, then
(x) Sub may irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer or (y) from
and after the close of business on July 14, 2011, the Company shall have the
right, exercisable by delivering written notice to Parent and Sub to cause Sub
to, and upon receipt of such notice, Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Sub
to) , irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer at the then-
scheduled expiration date following the receipt of such notice from the
Company (delivered no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the then-
scheduled expiration date of the Offer). If the Offer is terminated pursuant
to this _Section 1.01(f)_, the Company shall proceed with and take all
actions necessary to hold the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The termination of the Offer pursuant to this
_Section 1.01(f)_ is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Termination_ ". Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.01(f)_, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01_, then
Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.01_, Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depository acting on behalf of Sub to return, all tendered shares of
Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof to the extent required
by the terms of the Offer. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
Offer Termination shall not give rise to a right of termination of this
Agreement unless to the extent expressly provided for in _Section 9.01_ and
that, absent such termination of this Agreement, the obligations of the
Parties hereunder other than those related to the Offer shall continue to
remain in effect, including those obligations with respect to the Merger.

(g) _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall
include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents
attached as exhibits thereto, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and promptly thereafter shall
mail the Offer Documents to the holders of the Company Common Stock as
required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Sub all information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable
securities laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Sub for inclusion in the
Offer Documents. Except as expressly contemplated by _Section 6.02(d)_, the
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Recommendation of the Company Board. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. Parent and Sub shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the

 



7  Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies
of all correspondence between Parent, Sub and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand. Parent and Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff
of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, and Parent and Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the formulation of any written response to any such written comments of the
SEC or its staff. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company
Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the
SEC with respect thereto, Parent and Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response.

 

(h) _Funds_. Subject in all respects to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer Conditions, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares
of Company Common Stock that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.

 

Section 1.02 _Company Actions_.

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC,
the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with
any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which,
except as expressly contemplated by _Section 6.02(d)_, shall describe and
make the Recommendation with respect to the Offer, and promptly thereafter
shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of the Company Common Stock. The
Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9 the Fairness Opinion. Parent
and Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information
concerning Parent and Sub that may be required by applicable securities laws
for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. The Company shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Sub upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent and Sub with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Schedule
14D-9, and the Company shall provide Parent and Sub and their respective
counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any
written response to any such written comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior
to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment

 



8  or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders of
Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and Sub and
their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response.

(b) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Sub promptly with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company
Common Stock as of a recent date and of those Persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, together with lists, copies of all lists of
stockholders, security position listings, computer files and all
other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Sub such
information (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) and assistance as Parent or Sub may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the
Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent and Sub shall not use or disclose the information
contained in any such labels, lists, listings and files other than
in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies
of such information then in their possession or control in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 1.03 _Top-Up_.

(a) _Top-Up_. The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable right (the "
_Top-Up_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Section 1.03_, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price up
to a number of newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and Sub
at the time of the Top-Up Closing (after giving effect to the Offer Closing),
shall constitute one share more than 91% (determined on a fully diluted basis)
of the shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up may
not be exercised to purchase an amount of Top-Up Shares in excess of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued (treating
shares owned by the Company as treasury stock as unissued) and not otherwise
reserved or committed for issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up. The
Top-Up shall be exercisable only once.

 

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up; Top-Up Closing_. If there shall have not been validly
tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn that number of shares of
Company Common Stock which, when added to (x) the shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent and its Affiliates and (y) the shares of Company
Restricted Stock and shares of Company Common Stock underlying Company Stock
Options that are immediately available to be acquired by Sub pursuant to the
Support Agreements immediately following the Acceptance Time, would represent
at least 90% of the shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding on 

 



9  the Offer Closing Date (the " _Short-Form Threshold_ "), Sub shall be deemed
to have exercised the Top-Up for such number of Top-Up Shares as is necessary
for Sub to reach the Short-Form Threshold and on such date shall give the
Company prior written notice specifying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time
of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing). The Company shall, as
soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and in any event no
later than the Offer Closing), deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based
on the information provided by Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up
Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up
Closing_ "), which shall take place at the location of the Merger Closing
specified in _Section 2.02_, and shall take place simultaneously with, or as
soon as reasonably practicable after, the Offer Closing, the purchase price
owed by Sub to the Company to purchase the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the
Company, at Subs option, (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, or
(ii) by (x) paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount
equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y)
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal
amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up less the
amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (the " _Promissory
Note_ "). The Promissory Note (i) shall be due on the first anniversary of
the Top-Up Closing, (ii) shall bear simple interest of 5% per annum, (iii)
shall be full recourse to Parent and Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole or in
part, at any time without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other
material terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to
Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares.

(c) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up
Shares that Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up will not be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be
issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Each of Parent and Sub hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an
"accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Sub agrees that the Top-Up and the Top-Up Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up are being and will be acquired by Sub for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 

(d) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. The Parties agree that any dilutive
impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.01(d)_ and that none of the
Parties shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

Section 1.04 _Directors_. 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the
initial acceptance for payment by Sub of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use of which term herein
shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent
shall exercise its rights under this  _Section_

 



10   _1.04(a)_ ) and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to
designate from time to time such number of members of the Company Board as
will give Parent, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, representation equal to at least that number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (i) the
total number of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or
appointed pursuant to this sentence) _multiplied by_ (ii) the percentage that
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer) bears to (B) the number of shares of the Company Common
Stock then outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that
Parents designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the
Effective Time the Company Board shall have at least two directors who are
members of the Company Board and who are not officers, stockholders or
Affiliates of the Company or Parent and who will be independent for purposes
of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act (the " _Independent Directors_ ");
_provided_ _further_ that, in such event, if the number of Independent
Directors shall be reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining
Independent Director shall be entitled to designate a Person to fill such
vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this
Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors
shall designate two Persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers,
stockholders or Affiliates of the Company or Parent and who will be
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and such
Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all action
requested by Parent necessary to effect any election or appointment pursuant
to this _Section 1.04_, including (at the election of Parent) (x) subject to
the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company By-Laws, increasing the
size of the Company Board, and (y) obtaining the resignation of such number of
its current directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such designees
to be so elected or appointed to the Company Board in compliance with
applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective
Time, Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act). From time to time after the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to be directors on the Company Board to
constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate)
as is on the Company Board on each committee of the Company Board to the
fullest extent permitted by all applicable Law and the rules of The Nasdaq
Stock Market (the " _Nasdaq_ "), and the Company shall take all action
requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election or appointment. 

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Company shall mail to its
stockholders the Information Statement containing the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, and the Company
agrees to make such mailing either (i) concurrently with the mailing of the
Schedule 14D-9 or (ii) if not included in the Schedule 14D-9, if Parent shall
have requested, within three (3) calendar days following such request, which
request shall not be delivered prior to ten (10) calendar days following the
mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that, in each case, Parent and Sub
shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required
to be included in the Information Statement with respect to such designees and
with respect to Parents officers, directors and Affiliates, and if not then
as soon as practicable thereafter).

(c) _Required Approvals of Independent Directors_. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_ and prior to
the

 



11  Effective Time, in addition to any other vote or approval required by the
Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company By-Laws or applicable Law,
the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors then in
office shall be required for the Company to consent (i) to amend this
Agreement or to terminate this Agreement, (ii) to waive or elect to enforce
any of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement, (iii) to extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent
or Sub or (iv) to any other matter under this Agreement.

(d) _Effects on Continued Listing_. After the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, upon Parents request, take all action reasonably necessary to elect to
be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by Listing Rule 5615(c) of
the Nasdaq rules (or any successor provision).

of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings and recordings required under
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on such date and time as the
Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of

 



12  the State of Delaware or at such other date and time as Parent and the

time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Effective Time_ ".

Section 2.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set

13 _ARTICLE III_

_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

_Constituent Corporations_

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is directly owned by the Company as treasury stock, or by Parent or
Sub at such time, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
Company Common Stock issuable upon settlement of Company Restricted Stock
under _Section 3.04(d)_, but excluding shares to be canceled in accordance
with _Section 3.01(b)_ and, except as provided in _Section 3.01(d)_, the
Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
dividends declared from and after the date hereof in compliance with _Section
6.01(a)_ with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time and that are due to such holder.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and
who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_, but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,

 



14  withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_,
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or written
threats thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.

Section 3.02  _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the
other provisions of this Agreement but without duplication of the provisions
of _Section 1.01(c)_, if at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, if there shall be any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ shall be equitably adjusted
by Parent to reflect the effect thereof, and such adjustment to the Merger
Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
_provided_  that nothing in this _Section 3.02_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.03 _Exchange Fund_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article III_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in the form reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Paying Agency Agreement_ "). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to
this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the

 



15  Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary
form (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents
message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form)), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate
shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
into the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends
declared in compliance with _Section 6.01(a)_ with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time with respect to such
Company Common Stock may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration and any such dividends to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.03(b)_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to this _Article III_ and any dividends declared in compliance with
_Section 6.01(a)_ with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain
unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article
III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay all dividends declared in compliance with _Section 6.01(a)_
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the
Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof
as provided in this _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ and any dividends declared
in compliance with _Section 6.01(a)_

 



16  with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the
Effective Time and that are due to any such holder.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent, and any Taxes
resulting therefrom shall be paid by Parent. Nothing contained herein and no
investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger
Consideration or any holder of a Company Stock Option to receive the holders
Equity Award Amount, in each case as provided herein.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends declared in compliance with _Section 6.01(a)_
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the
Effective Time with respect thereto.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price, Merger Consideration,
Equity Award Amount and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of a
Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock (together, the "Company
Equity Awards"), as applicable, such amounts as Parent, Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of applicable tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock or the holder of the Company Equity Award,

 



17  as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 

Section 3.04 _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or
releases, if any, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
from holders of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock and take
all such other action, without incurring any liabilities in
connection therewith, as Parent may deem to be necessary or reasonably
required to give effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 3.04(b)_
and _Section 3.04(c)_. As promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as are required to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by _Section 3.04(b)_ and _Section 3.04(c)_ at the earlier to
occur of the time of the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time (such earlier
time, the " _Acceleration Time_ ").

 

(b) At the Acceleration Time, each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised
Company Stock Option shall vest and become exercisable. To the extent not
exercised prior to the Acceleration Time, then upon the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option shall be deemed to be exercised and canceled, with each
former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option becoming entitled
to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, in
consideration of the deemed exercise and cancellation of such Company Stock
Option, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the excess, if any,
of (A) the Offer Price over (B) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option.

 

(c) Each holder of an unvested award of Company Restricted Stock shall have
the right to tender such Company Restricted Stock into the Offer, subject to
and contingent upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time. At the Acceleration
Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully vested, and
the restrictions thereon shall lapse and, to the extent not withheld by
the Company to satisfy Tax withholding obligations, the Company shall deliver
shares of Company Common Stock in settlement thereof or, if such Company
Restricted Stock is tendered into the Offer, shall be treated as a share of
Company Common Stock properly tendered into the Offer.

(d) The payment of all Equity Award Amounts hereunder shall be subject to
appropriate withholding for taxes in accordance with _Section 3.03(h)_. The
term " _Equity Award Amounts_ " means, collectively, all amounts payable
pursuant to this _Section 3.04_.

 



18 _ARTICLE IV_

_Representations and Warranties of the Company_

Except (i) as disclosed in any report, schedule, form, statement or other

Laws of the State of Delaware. Each Company Subsidiary has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, except
to the extent the failure of any such Company Subsidiary to be in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Section
4.01_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of
all of the Subsidiaries of the Company (each a " _Company Subsidiary_ " and,
collectively, the " _Company Subsidiaries_ "), and the jurisdiction of
organization thereof.

Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company By-Laws, which were
previously furnished or made available to Parent, are complete and correct,

available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the charter and by-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents), and all amendments thereto, of each of
the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of
its organizational or governing documents.

terms, subject to the Enforceability Exception.

Section 5.03 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub do not,
and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of
a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets (tangible or intangible) of Parent or Sub under (other
than any such Lien created as a result of any action taken by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary), any provision of (a) Parents certificate of
incorporation, Parents bylaws, Subs certificate of incorporation or Subs

filings and notifications described in  _Section 5.03(b)_ have been made and
any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired prior to the
Acceptance Time, any Law applicable to Parent or Sub or by which any property
or asset of Parent or Sub is bound, or (c) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, franchise, Permit or other
legally binding obligation to which Parent or Sub is a party, except, as to
clauses (b) and (c), respectively, for any such conflicts,

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) No consent, approval, order, waiver or authorization of, registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Authority is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent and Sub or the consummation by Parent and Sub of the

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.04 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company complete and
correct copies of (i) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, from Sponsor (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") to provide, subject
to the terms and conditions therein, financing in the aggregate amount set
forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) the executed commitment
letter and the Redacted Fee Letter, each dated as of the date hereof, from
General Electric Capital Corporation, GE Capital Markets, Inc. and Jefferies
Finance LLC (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with
the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") to provide,
subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in an aggregate
amount set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the
Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, none of the
Financing Commitments has been amended or modified, no such amendment or
modification is presently contemplated, and the respective obligations and
commitments contained in such letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect. Parent or Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof, and, as of the date hereof, the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and are the valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent and Sub, subject to the Enforceability
Exception, and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter only, to the
knowledge of Parent and Sub) the other parties thereto. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Offer
and/or the Merger (as applicable), the net proceeds of the Financing if funded
in accordance with the Financing Commitments are, in the aggregate, sufficient
for Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the Offer Price in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment
in the Offer, the aggregate Merger Consideration, all amounts required to be
paid pursuant to _Section 3.04_, and all fees and

 



42  expenses directly related to the Debt Financing required to be paid by
Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this Agreement,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Sub or Sponsor (in
the case of Parent and Sponsor, only with respect to the Equity Commitment
Letter) under the Financing Commitments or, to the knowledge of Parent and
Sub, any other party thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will not
be available to Parent or Sub on the date of the Closing. The Financing
Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Financing available to
Parent on the terms in the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or
understandings, to which Parent or Sub or any of their Affiliates is a party,
that could increase the conditionality or reduce the amount of the Debt
Financing.

Section 5.05 _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantees
duly executed by the Guarantors with respect to certain matters on the terms
specified therein. Each Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and
constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantors
party thereto in favor of the Company, subject to the Enforceability
Exception, and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of any Guarantor under
such Limited Guarantee.

Section 5.06 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Action pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent or Sub, threatened against Parent, Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date hereof, there is no Order outstanding against Parent, Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.07 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub or any of its Subsidiaries
expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Offer
Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Information Statement will, at the time
such document is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended
or supplemented or at the time such document is first published, sent or
given to the Companys stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

 



43 Section 5.08 _Operation and Ownership of Sub_. Sub has been formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to
the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any business activities, other
than activities pursuant to this Agreement and the Financing. Parent owns,
beneficially and of record, all the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Sub, free and clear of all Liens (other than any Liens created pursuant to the
Financing).

Section 5.09 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders or
financial advisors fee or commission in connection with the Offer, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Sub.

Section 5.10 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of Parent, Sub or any
of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the last three
(3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL.

Section 5.11  _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Sub is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. After giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of
the Offer Price in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer, the aggregate Merger
Consideration, all amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.04_
hereof, and all related fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Sub
and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Offer, the Merger, the
Financing and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligations to
consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable), the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent as of and after the Effective Time. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " means that, as of any date
of determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the fair value of the
assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is
greater than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent
liabilities, of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (b)
the present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will
be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries,
on a consolidated basis, on their debts and liabilities as they become
absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, are not engaged in business or a transaction, and are not about to
engage in business or a transaction, for which such Persons and its
Subsidiaries assets, on a consolidated basis, would constitute
unreasonably small capital, and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur
debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities as
they mature;  _provided_ , _however_ , for the purposes hereof, the amount of
any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in
light of all of the facts

 



44  and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can
reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective
of whether such contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

Section 5.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
acknowledges that none of Parent, Sub or any other Person on behalf of Parent
or Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Parent or Sub or with respect to any other information provided to
the Company.

occur, at any time prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval), the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 6.02(b)_:

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor to a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of
this Agreement (which Acquisition Proposal does not arise out of any breach
of this _Section 6.02_) if and only if, prior to providing such information,
the Company has received from the Person so requesting such information an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, provided that the Company
shall promptly make available (which may be by posting to the "virtual data
room" available to Parent and its Representatives) to Parent any information
concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such access and that was
not previously made available to Parent or the Parent Representatives;

(ii) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person who
has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iii) grant a limited waiver, amendment or release under any standstill
agreement for the sole purpose of allowing a Third Party to make a private
and confidential unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal to the Company
Board; or

(iv) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing actions set forth in clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii);

_provided_ that, prior to taking any action described in _Section
6.02(b)(i)_, _Section 6.02(b)(ii)_, _Section 6.02(b)(iii)_ or _Section
6.02(b)(iv)_ above, (A) the Company Board (or any authorized committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and (B) the Company Board
(or any authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith,
based on information then available and after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal.

(c) Except as expressly provided by _Section 6.02(d)_, at any time after the
date hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 



50 (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) in any manner adverse to Parent or
Sub, the Recommendation with respect to the Offer or the Merger, (B) adopt,
approve or recommend or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal, (C) (1) fail to publicly recommend against any
Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing or (2) fail to publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within five (5)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing; _provided_ that, other than
in connection with a competing Acquisition Proposal, Parent may only make two
(2) such requests, (D) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any Acquisition Proposal subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, (E) fail to include the
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, if applicable, or
(F) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar
document or Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than
any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
Section 6.02(b)), it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt,
neither the approval or delivery of a Determination Notice shall be, by
itself, deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (any action described
in clauses (A) through (F), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive Contract with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 6.02(b)_) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time (or, if the Offer Termination shall
occur, at any time prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval),

(i) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of any breach of this Section
6.02) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board
(or any authorized committee thereof) concludes in good faith constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board (or any authorized committee
thereof) may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
such Superior Proposal, or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, if and only if:

(A) the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Laws;

(B) the Company shall have complied with all of its obligations under this
Section 6.02 with respect to such Superior Proposal;

 

(C) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a " _Determination
Notice_ ") to Parent at least five (5) business days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ "), to the effect that the Company Board has received a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not arise
out of any breach of this Section 6.02) that

 



51  the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) has concluded in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board (or any authorized
committee thereof) has determined to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.02(d)_,
which notice shall specify the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making the Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all
relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal;

(D) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal; provided that, in the event of any material revisions to the
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or any authorized committee
thereof) has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new Determination Notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of this _Section 6.02_ (including _Section 6.02(d)_) with
respect to such new Determination Notice and the revised Superior Proposal
contemplated thereby; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Notice Period with
respect to any new Determination Notice delivered pursuant to the immediately
preceding proviso shall be reduced from five (5) Business Days to three (3)
Business Days; and

 

(E) in the case of any action contemplated by clause (y) of this _Section
6.02(d)_, the Company shall concurrently terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.01(f)_, including the payment of the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 9.03(b_); or

 

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may take the actions specified in clauses (A), (C)(2) or (E) of Section
6.02(c)(i) ("Intervening Event Change of Recommendation") in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws, if and only if:

(A) the Company shall have provided a Determination Notice to Parent for at
least the Notice Period to the effect that the Company Board has determined to
effect an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, which notice shall
specify the Intervening Event in reasonable detail (and provided that any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening
Event Change of Recommendation shall require a new notice and a new Notice
Period);

 

(B) prior to effecting such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, the
Company shall, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that such Intervening
Event no longer necessitates such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation;
and

 



52 (C) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such Intervening Event continues to necessitate an Intervening Event
Change of Recommendation (in each case taking into account any revisions to
this Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent).

None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board
shall enter into any agreement with any Person providing that the Company is
not permitted to give prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation or prior notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement
in light of a Superior Proposal, or limiting its ability to give such notice,
in each case in accordance with this _Section 6.02(d)_.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.02_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), _provided_ ,
that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days following any request by Parent, or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

(f) The Company agrees that it shall promptly (and, in any event, within one
(1) Business Day of the Companys knowledge of any such event) notify Parent
if (x) any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are
received by, (y) in connection with any inquiry, proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, any non-public
information is requested from or (z) any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued in connection with the submission of an
Acquisition Proposal with, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such offer or proposal and the material
terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable,
copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt
basis, of any material developments or modifications to the terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status of any such material discussions or
negotiations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within one
(1) Business Day after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft
agreements (and any other written material to the extent such material
contains any financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to
any Acquisition Proposal) sent by or provided to the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company Representative in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(g) No Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of
causing any Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Support Agreements.

 



53 (h) The Company agrees that in any event any Company Subsidiary or Company
Representative takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this _Section 6.02_, the Company shall be deemed to be
in breach of this _Section 6.02_.

 

 _ARTICLE VII_

_Additional Agreements_

Section 7.01 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) _Preparation of Proxy Statement_. As soon as practicable after the
date hereof (and in any event, but subject to Parents timely performance of
its obligations under _Section 7.01(b)_, within fifteen (15) Business Days
hereof), the Company shall prepare and shall cause to be filed with the SEC
in preliminary form a proxy statement relating to the Stockholders Meeting
(together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ "). Except as expressly contemplated by _Section 6.02(d)_,
the Proxy Statement shall include the Recommendation with respect to the
Merger, the Fairness Opinion and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company will cause the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the
Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, to not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
respect to information expressly supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and to satisfy all rules of Nasdaq. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent and Sub upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC
or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide
Parent and Sub with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall provide
Parent and Sub and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the formulation of any written response to any such written
comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement
or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or
responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and Sub a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response.

 

(b) _Covenants of Parent with Respect to the Proxy Statement_. Parent shall
provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and Sub as may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and
shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement and resolution of 

 



54  comments of the SEC or its staff related thereto. Parent will cause the
information relating to Parent or Sub supplied by it for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or
warranty is made by Parent or Sub with respect to information supplied by
the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement. Each of Parent and Sub will furnish to the Company the information
relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement promptly
following request therefor from the Company.

(c) _Mailing of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_. If the adoption of
this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law,
then the Company shall have the right, at any time after the latest of (i) the
Initial Expiration Date, (ii) three (3) Business Days after the Proxy
Statement Clearance Date and (iii) July 14, 2011, to (and Parent and Sub shall
have the right, at any time beginning three (3) Business Days after the Proxy
Statement Clearance Date, to request in writing that the Company, and upon
receipt of such written request, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable
and in any event within ten (10) Business Days), (x) establish a record date
(which record date shall be as soon as legally permissible) for and give
notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement (the " _Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ "), and (y)
mail to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date established
for the Stockholders Meeting a Proxy Statement (the date the Company elects
to take such action or is required to take such action, the " _Proxy Date_ ").
The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall such meeting be held later than thirty-five
(35) calendar days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
Companys stockholders and any adjournments of such meetings shall require the
prior written consent of the Parent other than in the case it is required to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the SEC or its staff has instructed
the Company is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may require the Company to adjourn or postpone the
Stockholders Meeting one (1) time (for a period of not more than thirty (30)
calendar days but not past seven (7) Business Days prior to the Outside Date),
unless prior to such adjournment the Company shall have received an aggregate
number of proxies voting for the adoption of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), which have not
been withdrawn, such that the condition in _Section 8.01(a)_ will be
satisfied at such meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for
the Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law or
the Companys By-Laws. Unless the Company Board shall have withdrawn,
modified or qualified its Recommendation thereof or otherwise effected a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Stockholders Meeting are solicited
in compliance with all applicable Laws 

 



55  and all rules of Nasdaq. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.01_, the Company shall submit this Agreement to
its stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting even if the Company Board shall
have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event
Change of Recommendation or proposed or announced any intention to do so. The
Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least
on a daily basis on each of the last seven (7) Business Days prior to the date
of the Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by
the Company with respect to the Stockholder Approval. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other
than (i) procedure matters and (ii) an advisory vote with respect to golden
parachute compensation arrangements in accordance with applicable federal
securities Laws) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders Meeting. 

(d) _Amendments to Proxy Statement_. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or their respective officers or directors should
be discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, such Party shall promptly inform the other
Parties. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company agree to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false
or misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause all documents that
such Party is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Merger to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, as applicable,
not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(e) _Short Form Merger_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the
Offer Closing and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up, Parent and its
Affiliates shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock, the Parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action,
including with respect to the transfer to Sub of any shares of Company Common
Stock held by Parent or its Affiliates, to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

Section 7.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall
afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants, financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement to all of its and its
Subsidiaries properties, books and records and to those employees of the
Company to whom Parent reasonably requests access (but not including, unless
consented to by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), access to perform physical or environmental
examinations to take samples of soil, ground water, air or products), and,
during such period, the Company shall furnish to Parent, as promptly
as reasonably practicable, all information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

 



56  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or disclose information where the Company reasonably determines that
such access or disclosure would (i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) conflict with or violate any
Law (including antitrust Laws) or any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party (with respect to each of clauses (i) and (ii)
above, it being agreed that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the
fact that it is withholding such information or documents and thereafter the
Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to cause such a jeopardy, breach, waiver or violation). No
investigation or access permitted pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company hereunder. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall, in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, keep confidential and not disclose, and shall
cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, financial
advisors and other Representatives to keep confidential and not disclose, all
Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) directly or
indirectly received from the Company or its Representatives.

Section 7.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Approvals; Transaction Litigation_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts (unless, with
respect to any action, another standard for performance is expressly provided
for herein) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) take all acts
necessary to cause (A) in the case of the Company, the Offer Conditions and
the conditions to the Merger Closing set forth in _Section 8.01_ or 
_Section 8.02_ to be satisfied, or (B) in the case of Parent and Sub, the
conditions to the Merger Closing _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.03_ to be
satisfied, in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable; (ii) obtain
all necessary consents, approvals, orders, waivers and authorizations of,
actions or nonactions by, any Governmental Authority or any third party and
make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with, and notices
to, any Governmental Authorities (including pursuant to the HSR Act and each
Foreign Merger Control Law) and take all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to avoid a suit, action, proceeding or investigation by, any Governmental
Authority; (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(iv) vigorously defend or contest any claim, suit, action or other proceeding
that would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or
delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Transaction Litigation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all obligations of the Company, Parent and Sub relating to
the Financing shall be governed exclusively by _Section 7.08_ and _Section
7.09_, and not this _Section 7.03_. " _Transaction Litigation_ " means any
Litigation commenced or threatened against any Party or any of its Affiliates
by any Governmental Authority or any private party relating to, arising out of
or involving this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or that would otherwise prevent or
materially impede, interfere

 



57  with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees
to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, (ii) supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this  _Section 7.03_ to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of
required authorizations, as applicable, under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall request and
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that neither this _Section 7.03_ nor the
"reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or be construed to
require Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates, in order to obtain any required approval from any
Governmental Authority or any Third Party, to: (i) (A) sell, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending
any such action, or (B) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or
commit to, any such sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture
or other encumberment, or holding separate, before or after the Acceptance
Time or the Effective Time, of any material assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates), or (ii) take or agree to take any other material action or
agree or consent to any material limitations or restrictions on freedom of
actions with respect to, or its ability, in any material respect, to retain,
or make material changes in, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates), if any of the actions in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of
this sentence would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Authority, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Parent or any of its Representatives, or
the Company or any of its Representatives, as the case may be, from any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Each Party shall keep the other Parties reasonably informed, but only to
the extent that doing so would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Party,
jeopardize any privilege of the Party with respect thereto regarding any such
Transaction Litigation; it being agreed that each Party will also cooperate
with the other Parties to permit such inspection of or to disclose
such information on a basis that does not compromise or waive such privilege
with respect thereto. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in
writing and the

 



58  Company shall cooperate fully with Parent in connection with, and shall
consult with and permit Parent and its Representatives to participate in, the
defense, negotiations or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and the
Company shall give consideration to Parents advice with respect to such
Transaction Litigation. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Company Subsidiary nor any of its or their Representatives to, compromise,
settle, come to a settlement arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation
hereby or consent thereto unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(f) Prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq
to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock from
Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after such delisting.

(g) The Company shall (i) not terminate or amend any of the Support Agreements
without Parents consent in Parents sole discretion and (ii) enforce its
rights under the Support Agreements as directed by Parent in Parents sole
discretion.

Section 7.04 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed
to be applicable to the Company, Parent or Sub, the Agreement, the Support
Agreements, the Offer, the Merger or the Top-Up, including the acquisition of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board, as
applicable, shall take all action necessary to ensure that the Offer, the Top-
Up, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and
otherwise act to eliminate, or if not possible minimize to the maximum extent
possible, the effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Support
Agreements, the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 7.05 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including the Surviving
Corporation) in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (the " _Company Employees_ ") will participate effective as
of or after the Effective Time (including any Company Benefit Plan) (such
plans, the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with
the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, prior to the
Effective Time (to the extent recognized prior to the Effective Time under a
similar Company Benefit Plan), for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting and for purposes of determining severance amounts to which a
Company Employee is entitled.

 



59 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any Parent Subsidiary, as applicable, shall honor, and Parent shall cause
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Parent Subsidiary, as
applicable, to honor, in accordance with their terms, all individual
employment, deferred compensation, severance and change of control
agreements, plans or policies between the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any

60 Section 7.06 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a director or officer (including as a fiduciary
with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") as provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company
By-Laws, the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any Company Subsidiary which has been made available to Parent prior to the
date hereof shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms. For a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified
Parties with respect to indemnification, exculpation and limitation of
liabilities of the Indemnified Parties and advancement of expenses. 

(b) Without limiting _Section 7.06(a)_ or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement set forth in _Section 7.06(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, from and after the Effective Time, in the event
of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation
(a " _Claim_ "), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or
in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of
any board committee), or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective predecessors, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including payment of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses
in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law
upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Claim. Any determination of entitlement to indemnification under the
preceding sentences shall be made by an independent counsel selected jointly
by the Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified Party. None of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification has been
or may be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (which
consent is not to be unreasonably withheld). No Indemnified Party shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened
or actual Claim for which indemnification has been or may be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder unless Parent or the Surviving Corporation
consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (which consent
is not to be unreasonably withheld). Each of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of any
matter for which such Indemnified Party has validly sought indemnification 

 



61  under such indemnification agreement. Parents and the Surviving
Corporations obligations under this _Section 7.06(b)_ shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights hereunder in respect of any Claim asserted
or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Claim.

 

(c) The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six (6)
years from the Effective Time, covering each Person who is covered by such
policies on the date of this Agreement on terms with respect to such coverage
and amounts at least as favorable as those of such policies in effect on the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum aggregate
annual premium for such insurance policies for any such year shall not be in
excess of the maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by the immediately
following sentence; _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ , any such tail policy may
not be amended, modified or cancelled or revoked by the Company, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation in any manner that is adverse to the beneficiaries.
In the event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then,
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
for such insurance (which amount the Company represents and warrants is set
forth in  _Section 7.06(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); and
_provided_ _further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount; and _provided_ _further_ that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing
terms, including with respect to coverage and amounts, no less favorable in
the aggregate to any Indemnified Party.

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and other
assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, respectively,
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.06_ unless assumed by operation of Law.

(e) From and after the Effective Time (but not prior thereto), the provisions
of this _Section 7.06_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs. The provisions
of this _Section 7.06_ are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise.

Change or Intervening Event Change of Recommendation. 

Section 7.08 _Financing_.

Financing on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
described in the Financing Commitments (or on terms no less favorable to
Parent and Sub with respect to the conditionality and amount (including the

using commercially reasonable efforts to seek to enforce its rights under
the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a material breach thereof by the
Debt Financing provider(s) thereunder, and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under (x)
the Equity Commitment Letter (other than to increase the amount of the Equity
Financing) or (y) the Debt Commitment Letter (except in compliance with the
flex provisions of the Redacted Fee Letter in effect as of the date hereof),
if such amendment, modification or waiver reduces the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount), amends the conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent
the Offer Closing Date or the Merger Closing Date or make the funding of the
Debt Financing less likely to occur, adversely impacts the ability of any
Party hereto to enforce or cause the enforcement of the rights of Parent or
Sub under any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
relating thereto or imposes additional material obligations on the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries or Affiliates of the Company prior to the earlier of
the Offer Closing Date and the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Sub may amend or restate the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication 

 



63  agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any such amendment, modification or waiver. Each of Parent
and Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable to
Parent and Sub), (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable
to it in such definitive agreements that are within its control, (iii) upon
satisfaction of such conditions, to consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Offer Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer,
if the Offer Termination has not occurred) and the Merger Closing (with
respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger and make other payments
due at such time in accordance with the terms hereof) and (iv) to comply with
its obligations under the Financing Commitments.

 

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (such terms and conditions to include flex provisions contained in
the Redacted Fee Letter) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (i)
Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby with terms and conditions that are not
materially less favorable from the standpoint of Parent, Sub and the Company
than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (giving
effect to any applicable flex provisions) as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ "). Parent
shall promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of each alternative
financing commitment (" _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") (together with a
redacted copy of any related fee letter) to the Company. For purposes of
this  _Section 7.08_, references to "Financing" shall include the financing

party to any Financing Commitments or definitive document related to the
Financing of which it has actual knowledge; (ii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from a financing source for the
Financing with respect to any actual or potential breach, default, termination
or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitments or any definitive
document related to the Financing or any material provisions of the Financing
Commitments or any definitive document related to the Financing; and (iii) of
the occurrence of an event or development that Parent or Sub expects to have
a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent or Sub to obtain all or
any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitments or the definitive documents related to the Financing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 7.08_ shall require, and in no event shall
the

 



64  reasonable best efforts of Parent or Sub be deemed or construed to require,
either Parent or Sub to seek the Equity Financing from any source other than
those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by,
the Equity Financing Commitment, or (ii) pay any fees materially in excess of
those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (whether to secure waiver of
any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
intellectual property rights.

(c) Nothing in this  _Section 7.09_ shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would (i) cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_
to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement
(unless waived by Parent), (ii) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate the
Companys organizational documents or any Laws or result in the material

Solely if the Offer Termination shall have occurred or the Offer Closing shall
not have occurred, then the obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is
further subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
(disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Merger Closing Date as though made on
the Merger Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and
warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive
officer thereof to such effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Sub_. Parent and Sub shall have
performed or complied in all material respects with its obligations required
to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the
Merger Closing, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Parent by an executive officer thereof to such effect.

 

Section 8.04 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither Parent nor Sub may
rely on the failure of any condition set forth in  _Sections 8.01_ or _8.02_
to be satisfied if such failure was caused by the failure of Parent or Sub to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement. The Company may not rely
on the failure of any condition set forth in _Sections 8.01_ or _8.03_ to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by its failure to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

unless the Company has actual knowledge that such withdrawal was not made in
good faith), (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or

the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for any transaction
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of when made) (which

shall pay to the Sponsor the Company Termination Fee (less the amount of
expenses previously paid pursuant to _Section 9.03(e)_) by wire transfer of
same-day funds on the date such transaction is consummated. Solely for
purposes of this _Section 9.03(c)_, all references to "15%" in the definition
of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (i) Section
9.01(d) due to a willful breach by Parent of any of its representations or
warranties or the willful failure by Parent to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, (ii) _Section 9.01(g)_ or (iii)

practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) following the
date of termination of this Agreement.

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent pursuant to
Section 9.01(e) as a result of an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation

Acquisition Proposal shall have become publicly known and not publicly
withdrawn and (B) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i), or (y) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.01(c)_ due to a willful breach by the Company of any of its
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement or due to the
failure by the Company to 

 



74  perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, then
the Company shall reimburse Parent for all documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financing sources (including commitment fees), experts, consultants
and the costs of all filing fees and printing costs) incurred by Sponsor,
Parent, Sub or their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby by payment to Parent (or a Person designated
by Parent in writing) of the amount thereof by wire transfer of same day funds

Business Days following request therefor); _provided_ , _however_ , that the

contained in this  _Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the fee or
reimbursement amount due pursuant to _Section 9.03_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent or the Company commences an Action that results in an
award against the other Party for such fee or reimbursement, the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, shall pay to the other Party its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such Action, together with interest on the amount of the applicable fee

time before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred or the Stockholder
Approval shall have been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) after the
Offer Closing and subject to Section 3.02, there shall be no amendment that
decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration, and (y) after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that
by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
such further approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 

Section 9.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other Parties, (b) to the extent permitted by Law, waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) to the extent permitted by
Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware, for the purpose of any Action directly
or indirectly based upon, relating to arising out of this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby (including the Limited Guarantee, Equity
Financing Commitment or, subject to _Section 11.08(c)_, the Debt Commitment
Letter) or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and
each of the Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to
such action or proceeding shall be brought in, and may be heard and
determined, exclusively in such state or federal courts. Each of the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue
in, and any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any action or
proceeding so brought. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons
and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such Party at the
addresses set forth in _Section 11.03_. Nothing in this _Section 11.08_
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION OF
ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION (INCLUDING ANY CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM),
WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE,
AGAINST ANY OF THE FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY
DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER
OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, IN EACH CASE, IN ANY FORUM OTHER THAN THE SUPREME
COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK, OR, IF UNDER APPLICABLE
LAW EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IS VESTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS, THE UNITED STATES

 



93  DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (AND APPELLATE COURTS
THEREOF).

Section 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING TO
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(INCLUDING THE EQUITY FINANCING COMMITMENT OR THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER) OR
THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS
WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 11.10 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that in any such case
any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated by monetary
damages alone. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01_ and in all
cases subject to the specific requirements set forth in Section 11.10(b) (as
it relates to obtaining a remedy contemplated by this Section 11.10(a) with
respect to causing the Equity Financing to be funded), each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of
specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with Section
11.08, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
under the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party hereto
accordingly agrees, subject in all respects to _Section 11.10(b)_, not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.10. Any
Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to post a bond or undertaking in
connection with such order or injunction sought in accordance with the terms
of this Section 11.10.

 



94 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing the right of the Company to obtain an
injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
relief, in each case, solely with respect to causing Parent and Sub to, or to
directly, cause the Equity Financing to be funded at any time but only
simultaneously with the receipt of the Debt Financing (whether under this
Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment Letter or the Limited Guarantee)
shall be subject to the requirements that:

(i) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Offer
Closing, all of the Offer Conditions (other than the Financing Proceeds
Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived as of the expiration of the
Offer, and, with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at
the Merger Closing, all the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ (other
than _Section 8.01(d)_, to the extent the Offer Termination has occurred)
and _Section 8.02_ would have been satisfied if the Merger Closing were to
have occurred at such time (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Merger Closing, each of which
shall be capable of being satisfied at the Merger Closing),

(ii) the Debt Financing (or, in the case Alternative Debt Financing has been
obtained in accordance with _Section 7.08(c)_ for all the Debt Financing,
such Alternative Debt Financing) has been funded or would be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing,
as applicable, if the Equity Financing is funded at the Offer Closing or the
Merger Closing, as applicable, and

(iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if the
Equity Financing and the Debt Financing were funded, it would take such
actions that are within its control to cause the Merger Closing to occur.

effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

_Conditions to the Offer_

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Sub shall not
be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Sub to, accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Subs obligation
to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after
the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if: (a) there be validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of
shares of Company Common Stock that when added to the number of shares to be
purchased by Sub under the Top-Up plus the shares of Company Restricted Stock
and shares of Company Common Stock underlying Company Stock Options that are
immediately available to be acquired by Sub pursuant to the Support Agreements
immediately following the Acceptance Time, represent at least 90% of (x) the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the expiration of the Offer
plus (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable to
holders of Company Stock Options from which the Company or its Representatives
have received notices of exercise prior to the expiration of the Offer (and
as to which shares of Company Common Stock have not yet been issued to such
exercising holders of Company Stock Options), plus (z) the number of shares to
be purchased by Sub under the Top-Up (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");
(b) the waiting period applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger under the HSR
Act (or any extension thereof) shall have neither expired nor terminated; (c)
Parent (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) shall not have received
the proceeds of the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Debt Financing) and/or
the lenders party to the Debt Financing Letter (or New Debt Commitment Letter
for any Alternative Debt Financing) shall not have confirmed to Parent and Sub
that the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Debt Financing) in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Offer and the Merger will be available at the
Offer Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing
Letter (or New Debt Commitment Letter for any Alternative Debt Financing) ("
_Financing Proceeds Condition_ "); or (d) any of the following
conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of the
Offer:

(i) there shall be any Restraint in effect enjoining or otherwise preventing
or prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or
the Offer;

(ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company (A) set forth in
_Section 4.04_, _Section 4.10(e)_, _Section 4.11(i)_, _Section 4.23_, 
_Section 4.24_ and _Section 4.26_ shall not be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the expiration of
the Offer as though made as of the expiration of the Offer, (B) set forth in
_Section 4.03_ shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the date
of this Agreement and as of the expiration of the Offer as though made as of
the expiration of the Offer, except where the failure to be so true and
correct has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result in
additional cost, expense or liability to the Company, Parent and their
Affiliates, individually or in the aggregate, of more than $1,000,000, (C) set
forth in  _Section 4.09(i)_ shall not be true and correct without
disregarding the "Company

 



100   Material Adverse Effect" qualification set forth therein and (D) set forth
in this Agreement, other than those described in clauses (A), (B) and (C)
above, shall not be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or
limitations as to "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and words of
similar import set forth therein), except, in the case of this clause (C),
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and
correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect and except, in each case, to the extent such
representations and warranties are made as of a specific date (in which case
such representations and warranties shall not be true and correct (subject to
such qualifications) as of such specific date only);

 

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with its obligations required to be performed or complied with by it
under this Agreement;

(iv) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any change,
circumstance, event or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have (i) a Company Material Adverse Effect of a type described in clause
(a) of the definition thereof or (ii) a Company Material Adverse Effect that
would prevent the consummation by the Company of the Merger;

(v) in the event that the exercise of the Top-Up is necessary to ensure that
Parent or Sub owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock immediately after the Acceptance Time, there shall exist under
applicable Law or other Restraint any restriction or legal impediment on
Subs ability and right to exercise the Top-Up, or the shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up together with the shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn
are insufficient for Sub to own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock;

(vi) a Triggering Event shall have occurred; and

(vii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate
executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the conditions set
forth in clauses (d)(ii), (d)(iii), and (d)(iv) above shall have occurred and
be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer. 

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Tender Condition and the
condition set forth in clause (d)(v) have been satisfied, Parent and Sub
shall have the right to include or exclude for purposes of its determination
thereof shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures.

 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Parent and Sub to extend, terminate or modify the
Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



101  The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and Sub in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than
the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by Parent or Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

 

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I and not defined in this Annex I
shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of May 24, 2011, by and among CPK Holdings Inc., CPK Merger Sub Inc. and
California Pizza Kitchen, Inc.
