SECTION 1.4 _Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet_. The amount of Cash on

the Cash Portion shall each be determined from a consolidated balance sheet of

Cash Portion (the " _Dispute_ "). If Seller does not give to Purchaser a
written notice of the Dispute that sets forth the amounts with which Purchaser
disagrees (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") within the Dispute Period, the Closing
Balance Sheet shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by Seller in
the form in which it was delivered to Seller and shall be final and binding
upon the parties. If Seller  



 

3  delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within the Dispute Period, Purchaser
and Seller shall attempt to resolve the Dispute and agree in writing upon
the final content of the disputed Closing Balance Sheet within 30 days after
delivery of such Dispute Notice.

(b) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve each element of the Dispute

public accounting firm that has not performed accounting, tax or auditing
services for Purchaser, Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates during
the past three years as the arbitrator of the Dispute (the " _Arbitrating
Accountant_ "). If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the identity
of the Arbitrating Accountant, the accountants of Purchaser and Seller shall
jointly select the Arbitrating Accountant. The Arbitrating Accountants
function shall be to conform the Closing Balance Sheet to the requirements of
_Sections 1.3_ and _1.4_ and to calculate the Cash Portion in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement based on the elements and amounts reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet.

(c) In connection with the resolution of the Dispute, the Arbitrating
Accountant shall allow Purchaser and Seller to present their respective
positions regarding the elements and amounts of the Closing Balance Sheet in
dispute. The Arbitrating Accountant may, at its discretion, conduct a
conference concerning the Dispute, at which conference Purchaser and Seller
shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and other
information and to have present their respective advisors, counsel and
accountants. In connection with the resolution of the Dispute, there shall be

final and binding upon the parties and judgment may be entered on the award.

expenses to be paid by Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, based on the degree to which the Arbitrating Accountant has accepted the
positions of the respective parties.

by the exceptions noted in the schedules delivered by the Company to Purchaser
concurrently herewith and identified as the " _Disclosure Schedule_ ",
as such may be modified from time to time pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_. To
the extent that an item or matter is disclosed in one section of the
Disclosure Schedule and it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that it also applies to disclosure required by any other section
of the Disclosure Schedule, such item or matter shall be deemed to be
disclosed in such other section whether or not an explicit cross-reference
appears. The inclusion of any item or matter in the Disclosure Schedule is
not evidence of the materiality of such item or matter for purposes of this
Agreement.

SECTION 2.2  _Representations and Warranties of Purchaser and Holdings_.

this Agreement. Neither the execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents by Purchaser and Holdings, as applicable, nor the consummation by
Purchaser and Holdings, as applicable, of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,

certificate of formation, certificate of incorporation, limited liability
company agreement or bylaws, as applicable). Neither Purchaser nor Holdings
need to give any notice to, make any filing with or obtain any authorization,
consent or approval of any natural individual, corporation, partnership,

Person who is entitled to a brokers commission, finders fee, investment
bankers fee or similar payment for arranging the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or introducing the parties to each other. As used in this
Agreement, (i) " _Affiliate_ " with respect to any Person means any other

hereby or (ii) actions, suits, claims or legal, administrative or arbitration

meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") and is acquiring the Units for its own
account for investment and with no present intention of distributing or
reselling such securities or any part thereof in any transaction which would

Purchaser, in part, in reliance on the foregoing representation.

(i) _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the incurrence of any indebtedness
therewith, the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries will exceed their
respective liabilities. In connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the incurrence of any
indebtedness in connection therewith, neither Purchaser, Holdings, the Company
nor the Subsidiaries will incur debts that will be beyond their ability to pay
as such debts mature. 

(j) _WARN Act_. Purchaser has no present plans or intention to carry out,
after the Closing, any plant closing or mass layoff which would require

this Agreement, and has relied solely on the results of said investigation
and on the representations and warranties of the Company and Seller expressly
contained in _Sections 2.3 _and _2.4_ of this Agreement. Nothing in this 
_Section 2.2(l)_ or any other provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any claim by Purchaser for common law fraud.

(m) _Disregarded Entity_. Purchaser is an entity disregarded as separate from
its owner for United States federal income tax purposes.

Seller, as the sole unitholder of the Company. No other actions are necessary
on the part of the Company to authorize the execution, delivery and

the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated herein or
therein.

(c) _Enforceability_. This Agreement and the other Transactions Documents to
be executed and delivered by the Company have been duly authorized, executed

consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, nor the consummation by the Company at the Closing of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, will conflict with or result
in a material breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
statute or administrative regulation, or of any order, writ, injunction,

ARTICLE VI

_POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS_

SECTION 6.1 _Inspection of Records_. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, shall each make their respective books and records
(including work papers in the possession of their respective accountants)
solely with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries available for
inspection by the other party, or by its duly accredited representatives, for
reasonable business purposes at all reasonable times during normal business
hours, for a five-year period after the Closing Date, with respect to all
transactions of the Company and the Subsidiaries occurring prior to and
relating to the Closing, and the historical financial condition, assets,
liabilities, operations and cash flows of the Company. As used in this
_Section 6.1_, the right of inspection includes the right to make extracts
or copies. The representatives of a party inspecting the records of the other
party shall be reasonably satisfactory to the other party.

SECTION 6.2 _Further Assurances_. The parties shall execute such further
documents, and perform such further acts, as may be necessary to transfer and
convey the Units to Purchaser, on the terms herein contained, and to
otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) In the event Seller receives any instrument of payment of any of the
accounts receivable of the Company or the Subsidiaries following the Closing
Date, Seller shall promptly deliver it to the Company or the Subsidiary (as
applicable), endorsed where necessary, without recourse, in favor of the
Company or the Subsidiary (as applicable).

(b) In the event the Company or any Subsidiary receives any instrument of
payment payable to the Seller or any of its subsidiaries, the Company or such
Subsidiary (as applicable) shall promptly deliver it to the Seller, endorsed
where necessary, without recourse, in favor of the Seller. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall take commercially reasonable efforts to
collect all amounts payable to Pace Industries de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., in
respect of refunds for value added taxes pursuant to transactions occurring
prior to the Closing, and to the extent such payment exceeds $710,000, the
Company shall promptly remit such excess to Seller.

SECTION 6.3  _Third-Party Claims_. The parties shall cooperate with each
other with respect to the defense of any Third-Party Claims subsequent to the
Closing Date which are not subject to the indemnification provisions contained
in _Article IX_ , provided that the party requesting cooperation shall
reimburse the other party for the other partys reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses of furnishing such cooperation. With respect to the defense of
claims or litigation related to the Business, "cooperate", "reasonably
cooperate" or "cooperation" means that the party shall cooperate as reasonably
necessary to conduct the defense and with assigned defense counsel, including
providing documents and other materials or information, whether in tangible
or electronic form, as may be necessary to respond to discovery requests
and/or to mount a defense; and similarly to make executives and employees
available to defense counsel for investigation of facts, responding to
discovery requests and motions, preparation for and attendance at depositions,
hearings, and trials, giving of truthful testimony or truthful affidavits, and
as otherwise necessary for the ethical and reasonable conduct of the defense.



 

24 SECTION 6.4 _Agreement to Defend and Indemnify_. For a period of six (6) years
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to comply with
all obligations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, under their respective
certificates or articles of incorporation, by-laws or operating agreements,
in each case as currently in effect, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and also advance expenses as incurred, to each person who is now or has been
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing an officer or
director of the Company, any Subsidiary or the Business (the " _Indemnified
Officers_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable and documented counsel fees and expenses),
settlement payments or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any
claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in
part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or
was an officer or director of the Company, any Subsidiary or the Business, or
by reason of the fact that such person is or was a representative of the
Company, any Subsidiary or the Business, whether or not asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing. The parties hereto intend, to the extent
not prohibited by applicable law, that the indemnification provided for in
this _Section 6.4_ shall apply without limitation to acts or omissions, or
alleged acts or omissions by the Indemnified Officers in their capacities as
officers or directors or representatives, as the case may be, other than in
the case of willful misconduct, criminal conduct, gross negligence or gross
recklessness on the part of such Indemnified Officers. Purchaser acknowledges
and accepts as contract rights (and agrees to cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms) the provisions of the
Companys and the Subsidiaries respective certificate of formation or
certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof with respect to indemnification of officers, directors, employees and
agents of the Company and the Subsidiaries (including provisions relating
to contributions, advancement of expenses and the like) and agrees such
rights shall not be modified or amended except as required by law, unless such
modification or amendment expands the rights of the Indemnified Officers to
indemnification (including with respect to contribution, advancement of
expenses and the like).

SECTION 6.5 _Non-Solicitation; Non-Hire; Non-Disparagement_.

(a) Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that, except as expressly contemplated
in this Agreement and except for solicitations made generally to the public
in newspapers, on the internet or other like general solicitations, from the
date hereof, and for a period ending three (3) years following the Closing,
each of Seller and Purchaser (each on behalf of itself and its respective
subsidiaries and Affiliates, including the Company and the Subsidiaries in the
case of Purchaser) will not (i) solicit for hire, or hire (x) in the case of
Seller, any of the present officers or employees of the Company, the
Subsidiaries and/or the Business (unless such person is no longer an officer
or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary at the time discussions are
initiated) or (y) in the case of Purchaser, any of the present officers
or employees of the Seller or its subsidiaries (unless such person is no
longer an officer, employee or of the Seller or its subsidiaries at the time
discussions are initiated) or (ii) intentionally influence any employee of the
other party to terminate his or her employment or relationship with: (x) in
the case of Sellers obligations, the Company or Purchaser or (y) in the case
of Purchasers obligations, the Seller or its subsidiaries.

(b) Following the date of this Agreement, Seller agrees, on behalf of itself
and its affiliates, that it and the officers and directors of Seller,
its subsidiaries or its affiliates shall not make, or cause or permit any of
its officers, or agents to make, any false, defamatory or disparaging
statements about Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective direct or indirect parent companies or affiliates, or the officers
or directors of the Company or the Subsidiaries or its direct or indirect
parent companies or affiliates. Following the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser agrees, on behalf of itself, the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates, that it and the officers and directors of
Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates
shall not make, or cause or  



 

25  permit any of their respective officers, or agents to make, any false,
defamatory or disparaging statements about Seller or any of its respective
direct or indirect subsidiaries or Affiliates, or the officers or directors
of the Seller or its direct or indirect subsidiaries or affiliates.

SECTION 6.6 _Seller Restrictive Covenants_.

(a) Seller acknowledges that it has a special knowledge of the Business
and recognizes the competitive nature of the Business and, accordingly, to
induce Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated herein, it agrees that, for a period of five (5) years after the
Closing Date, Seller will not, directly or indirectly (through any,
subsidiary, Affiliate or otherwise), in one or a series of transactions, own,
manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of, or aid or assist anyone else in the conduct of, any
Competitive Business in the Territory.

" _Territory_ " means all of the United States, Canada and Mexico.

" _Competitive Business_ " means (i) manufacturing for the account of any
Person who is not Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, any aluminum, zinc or
magnesium die cast products and (ii) manufacturing or selling any molds, dies,
or other tooling of the same type or directly competitive with such products
manufactured and sold by the Business as the Business is conducted as of the
Closing date.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller and each of its Affiliates shall not
be restricted by this Section from manufacturing, selling or distributing
_for its own account_ inside or outside the Territory any product composed of
or containing aluminum, zinc or magnesium die cast products.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.6_, Seller
and each of its Affiliates shall not be restricted by this covenant from (i)
selling or distributing aluminum, zinc or magnesium die cast products which
are manufactured by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller outside the Territory to
any location outside the Territory or (ii) selling or distributing
Custom Furniture Components which are manufactured by Seller or an Affiliate
of Seller outside the Territory to persons who are not Affiliates of Seller
located in the Territory.

" _Custom Furniture Components_ " means aluminum, zinc and magnesium parts,
pieces and other items manufactured using the high pressure die casting
process which are used or intended for use in the manufacture or assembly of
(i) desks, chairs, cabinets, shelving and other furniture, fixtures or
equipment intended for use in (A) office settings, (B) medical or
dental offices or examination rooms, (C) hospitals or (D) commercial
establishments such as retail stores, restaurants and other types of shops and
service providers or (ii) casual outdoor furniture.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.6_ or this
Agreement, the restrictions set forth in _Section 6.6 _shall not: (i) apply
to any business acquired by Seller or any subsidiary or Affiliate of Seller
(including any investment in or joint venture with respect to such business)
which, in a manner ancillary to that businesss primary business, conducts
operations which would otherwise violate the covenant set forth in _Section
6.6_ (a " _Restricted Activity_ "), so long as such operations did not, during
the fiscal year ending before such acquisition, have gross revenues from all
Restricted Activity in excess of Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) or
(ii) restrict Seller or any subsidiary or Affiliate of Seller from holding or
having an economic interest in up to 5% of the outstanding capital stock of a
company listed on any recognized stock exchange.



 

26 (e) Seller acknowledges that, given the nature of the Business, the covenants
contained in this  _Section 6_ contain reasonable limitations as to time,
geographic scope and scope of activity to be restrained, and do not impose a
greater restraint than is necessary to protect and preserve the goodwill of
the Business and to protect the legitimate business interests of Purchaser.
If, however, this _Section 6.6_ is determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too long a
period of time, by reason of its being too broad in geographic scope or by
reason of its being too extensive in any other respect or for any other reason
it will be interpreted to extend only over the longest period of time for
which it may be enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other aspects
as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court and in such
action. Seller agrees that Purchasers remedies at law for any breach or
threat of breach by Seller or its Affiliates of the provisions of this 
_Section 6.6_ may be inadequate, and that Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions, without the necessity for the posting of a bond
or other collateral security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this 
_Section 6.6_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

SECTION 6.7 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in a manner consistent with
past practices, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company and each Subsidiary
for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall provide, and cause the Company and each Subsidiary to provide, Seller
with all information reasonably required for completing such returns in a
manner consistent with past practices. Seller shall file, or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns prepared pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 6.7(a)_ that are filed after the Closing Date. Seller shall pay to
the relevant taxing authority all Taxes due in connection with any such Tax
Return which Seller is required to have filed.

(b) (i) Purchaser and Seller agree to determine the amount of and allocate
the appropriate portion of the Purchase Price among the assets of the Company
that are deemed to be acquired by Purchaser other than pursuant to Section
338(h)(10) of the Code or any state or foreign law equivalent, in accordance
with the fair market value of such assets. Purchaser shall deliver Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594 and any similar state or local forms, in each case
together with any required schedules or attachments thereto (collectively,
the " _8594 Allocation Forms_ ") to Seller no later than 135 days following
the Closing Date. The 8594 Allocation Forms shall be prepared on a branch by
branch basis, including asset by asset detail. If within 30 days of receipt
of the 8594 Allocation Forms, Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that Seller
objects to one or more items reflected on the 8594 Allocation Forms, Purchaser
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Purchaser
and Seller fail to resolve any such dispute within 30 days of Purchasers
receipt of Sellers notice, the parties shall submit the dispute to a jointly-
retained third party firm for determination, which shall be final and binding
on the parties. The cost and expenses of such third party firm shall be borne
one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller. Seller and Purchaser shall each
adopt and abide by the 8594 Allocation Forms for purposes of all income Tax
Returns filed by them and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith
in connection with any examination of any such Tax Return, any refund claim,
or any judicial litigation proceeding unless there has been a final
"determination" (within the meaning of Code Section 1313(a)) which finally
and conclusively establishes the amount of any liability for Taxes. In the
event that the purchase price allocation described in this _Section
6.7(b)(i)_ is disputed by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of
the dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of such dispute and
the parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with each other concerning
resolution of the dispute.

(ii) Purchaser agrees that Purchaser shall join with Seller in making an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any similar election that
may be available under applicable state or local law) in respect of the
purchase of the capital stock of Pace Industries (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_") and in taking all legally required steps to effectuate
the same. Purchaser shall prepare a complete set of Section 338(h)(10)
Election Forms (as defined below). On or prior to the  



 

27  Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall exchange completed and executed
copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any similar state or local
forms, in each case together with any required schedules or attachments
thereto (collectively, the " _338(h)(10) Election Forms_ "). If any changes
are required in these forms as a result of information that is first available
after the Closing Date, the parties hereto will promptly agree on such
changes. Furthermore, Purchaser and Seller agree to determine the amount of
and allocate the appropriate portion of the Purchase Price among the assets of
Pace Industries that are deemed to be acquired by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or any state or foreign law equivalent, in
accordance with the methodology set forth in _Schedule 1.8_. Purchaser shall
deliver Internal Revenue Service Form 8883 and any similar state or local
forms, in each case together with any required schedules or attachments
thereto (collectively, the " _338(h)(10) Allocation Forms_ ") to Seller no
later than 135 days following the Closing Date. If within 30 days of receipt
of the 338(h)(10) Allocation Forms, Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that
Seller objects to one or more items reflected on the 338(h)(10) Allocation
Forms, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such dispute. If Purchaser and Seller fail to resolve any such dispute within
30 days of Purchasers receipt of Sellers notice, the parties shall submit
the dispute to a jointly-retained third party firm for determination, which
shall be final and binding on the parties. The cost and expenses of such
third party firm shall be borne one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller.
Seller and Purchaser shall each adopt and abide by the 338(h)(10) Election
Forms and the 338(h)(10) Allocation Forms for purposes of all income Tax
Returns filed by them and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith
in connection with any examination of any such Tax Return, any refund claim,
or any judicial litigation proceeding unless there has been a final
"determination" (within the meaning of Code Section 1313(a)) which finally and
conclusively establishes the amount of any liability for Taxes. In the event
that the Section 338 Election or purchase price allocation described in this
_Section 6.7(b)(i)_ is disputed by any taxing authority, the party receiving
notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of such
dispute and the parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with each other
concerning resolution of the dispute. Purchaser shall not make any election
under Section 338(g) with respect to any of the Subsidiaries.

(c) Without the prior written consent of the Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), neither Purchaser nor Holdings will amend or permit
the Company or any Subsidiary to amend any Tax Return relating a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller
shall have an unrestricted right to amend any Tax Return relating a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date unless such
amendment would have a material adverse impact on the Purchaser and the
Seller has not obtained the written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld).

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate
of its non-foreign status that complies with Treasury Regulation
§1.1445-2(b)(2).

(e) Except as required as a result of a final "determination" (within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code), neither Holdings nor Seller will, or
will cause or permit any of its Affiliates to, take any action which would
otherwise violate the requirements for a qualified stock purchase, as defined
in Section 338(d)(3) of the Code or Treasury Regulations Section
1.338-3(b)(1).

SECTION 6.8 _Use of Seller s Name or Reputation_. Except as specifically set
forth herein, Purchaser shall not operate the Business utilizing, based on or
taking advantage of the name, reputation or corporate goodwill of Seller or
any of its subsidiaries, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 6.9 _Insurance Claims_. Purchaser shall not and shall cause its
affiliates, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, not to assert, by way
of claim, litigation or otherwise, any right to any casualty, general
liability and other insurance maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(excluding the Company or any Subsidiary) in respect of the Business, the
Company or any Subsidiary (the " _Insurance_  



 

28   __ _Policies_ ")). Seller and/or its Affiliates shall retain all right,
title and interest under all Insurance Policies. Concurrent with the Closing,
Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries release all of their rights under
the Insurance Policies.

SECTION 6.10 _Workers Compensation_. Seller shall be responsible for all
liabilities and obligations of the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect
to workers compensation claims made for compensable injuries occurring prior
to the Closing Date, and the Company or the applicable Subsidiary shall be
responsible for all liabilities and obligations of the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary with respect to workers compensation claims made for
compensable injuries occurring on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of
this Section, a workers compensation claim is deemed to have been "made" at
the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to eligibility for
workers compensation benefits or at the time the occupational disease
becomes manifest, as applicable, under the respective workers compensation
act governing the alleged injury. With respect to any workers compensation
claims for which Seller is responsible under this  _Section 6.10_, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide reasonable assistance and
cooperation with respect to the administration and/or defense of any such
claims.

ARTICLE VII

SECTION 7.1 _Continuation of Employment_. Purchaser, the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary (and not Seller or any of its subsidiaries) shall

Date, including any claims arising out of or relating to any plant closing,
mass layoff or similar event under any applicable law, rule or regulation

established by the Company or any of its Affiliates for the benefit of
Company Employees, except that no credit for any such prior service need be

by a Person other than the parties, their successors and permitted assigns,
against any Indemnified Party or to which any Indemnified Party is subject.

(k) " _Transaction Compensation_ " means all stay bonus, closing bonus or
similar bonus or payment paid or payable by or on behalf of the Company or the
Subsidiaries (whether prior to or at the Closing) to current or former
directors, officers, employees, or consultants of the Company and the

this Agreement.

(l) " _Transaction Expenses_ " means, other than any Purchaser Due Diligence
Expenses, all broker, financial and other advisory, legal, tax, accounting,
and other fees, costs and expenses incurred on or prior to the Closing by
Seller, the Company or the Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 8.3 _Seller s Indemnification Obligations_. Subject to the other
provisions of this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing Date, Seller
shall indemnify, save and keep Purchaser and its directors, managers,
officers, members, stockholders, and Affiliates (the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") harmless against and from all Damages sustained or
incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee, as a result of or arising out of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Seller or the Company to Purchaser herein;

(b) the breach by the Seller or the Company of, or failure of the Seller or
the Company to comply with, any of the covenants or obligations under this
Agreement to be performed by Seller or the Company;



 

31 (c) Taxes which are unpaid as of the Closing and which are imposed on the

(e) any Transaction Expenses;

(f) the Specified Litigation Matters;

SECTION 8.4 _Limitation on Seller s Indemnification Obligations_.
Sellers obligations pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.3_ are subject
to the following limitations:

(a) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under _Section
8.3(a)_ on any individual claim unless the Damages associated with such claim
exceed $50,000 (the " _De Minimis Threshold_ "), and then only to the extent
of such excess (it being understood that a series of related claims arising
out of the same facts and circumstances shall be deemed a single claim for
purposes of this $50,000 threshold). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the De
Minimis Threshold shall not apply to amounts recoverable under _Section
8.3(a)_ for breaches of Fundamental Representations or for a breach of
_Section 2.3(l)_ (Taxes) and shall not apply to amounts recoverable under any
of _Section 8.3(b)_ through and including  _Section 8.3(h)_.

(b) Threshold and Deductible.

(i) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any amounts under
_Section 8.3(a)_ until the total amount which Purchaser Indemnitees would
recover under _Section 8.3(a)_, but for this _Section 8.4(b)(i)_, exceeds
$3,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "); _provided_ that once the total amount of
Damages incurred by Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds the Threshold, then the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover only for Damages in excess
of $1,500,000 (subject to the Indemnification Cap where applicable) but shall
in no event be entitled to recover the first $1,500,000 of Damages.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Threshold shall not apply to amounts
recoverable under _Section 8.3(a)_ for breaches of Fundamental
Representations or for a breach of _Section 2.3(l)_ (Taxes) and shall not
apply to amounts recoverable under any of _Section 8.3(b)_ through and
including _Section 8.3(h)_.

(ii) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any amounts
recoverable under _Section 8.3(g)_ until the total amount which Purchaser
Indemnitees would recover under _Section 8.3(g)_, but for this  _Section
8.4(b)(ii)_, exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Environmental Deductible_ ");
_provided_ that once the total amount of Damages incurred by Purchaser
Indemnitees exceeds the Environmental Deductible, then the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover only for Damages in excess
of the Environmental Deductible (subject to the Indemnification Cap) but shall
in no event be entitled to recover the first $1,500,000 of Damages.  



 

32  For the avoidance of doubt, the Environmental Deductible shall be separate
from and in addition to the Threshold.

(c) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under any provision
of _Section 8.3(a) and 8.3(g)_ for Damages in excess of $30,000,000 (the "
_Indemnification Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnification
Cap shall not apply to recovery under _Section 8.3(a)_ for breaches of
Fundamental Representations or for a breach of  _Section 2.3(l)_ (Taxes).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnification Cap shall not apply to amounts
recoverable under any of _Section 8.3(b)_ through and including _Section
8.3(f)_ and _Section 8.3(h) _(and shall apply to _Section 8.3(g)_);
_provided_ that in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability for Damages
under any provision(s) of this Agreement exceed an amount equal to the Cash
Portion (as adjusted in accordance with _Section 1.3_), less any Damages
previously recovered from Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) The amount of any recovery by Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
8.3_ shall be (i) reduced by any Tax Benefit actually realized by the
applicable Purchaser Indemnitees as a result of the state of the facts which
entitled Purchaser Indemnitees to recover from Sellers pursuant to _Section
8.3_ and (ii) increased by any Tax detriment actually realized by the
applicable Purchaser Indemnitees as a result of its losses, including any
Taxes imposed on the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to the receipt of any
indemnity payment made under this Article.

(e) The amount of any recovery by Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
8.3_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds paid to Purchaser
Indemnitees under any applicable insurance policy (including title insurance
policies) or any third party indemnification agreement, as a result of the
facts which entitled Purchaser Indemnitees to recover from Seller pursuant to
_Section 8.3_ (net of any applicable deductible and net of any out of pocket
costs incurred to obtain such proceeds or reimbursement). Each Purchaser
Indemnitee agrees to make all claims under applicable insurance policies
and/or third party indemnification agreements, and to seek recovery of all
Damages under all applicable insurance policies and/or third party
indemnification agreements; provided, that nothing in this _Section 8.3(e)_
shall require Purchaser or the Company to obtain or maintain run-off or tail
insurance coverage.

(f) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto in respect
of a breach of representation, warranty or covenant shall terminate when the
applicable representation, warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to
_Section 8.1_; provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the party to
be indemnified shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period, previously made a claim pursuant to _Section 8.6_.

(g) Subject to the immediately following sentence, if it is finally
determined that a Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to any recovery of Damages
hereunder, such recovery shall be satisfied as follows: (i) first, in cash
payable by Seller, and (ii) second, by setoff against amounts
otherwise payable by Purchaser to Seller under the Promissory Note; in each
case subject to any applicable limitations set forth in this Agreement
(including without limitation, if applicable, the Threshold and the
Indemnification Cap). Notwithstanding the foregoing, _however_ , if at any
time a default by Purchaser under the Promissory Note has occurred and is
continuing (regardless of the effect of any blockage, standstill or similar
provision in any subordination agreement or similar agreement executed by
Seller with respect to the Promissory Note), any recovery of damages under
_Sections 8.3(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be satisfied (i) first, by setoff against
the amounts payable under the Promissory Note until the earliest of the time
that (A) such default has been cured, (B) the Promissory Note is no longer
outstanding or (C) the aggregate remaining principal and interest payable
under the Promissory Note is less than the amount of remaining
Damages recoverable by the Purchaser Indemnitee hereunder, and (ii) second,
in cash; in each case subject to any applicable  



 

33  limitations set forth in this Agreement (including without limitation, if
applicable, the Deductible and the Cap).

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to recover under _Section 8.3_:

(i) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ACTUALLY PAID BY A PURCHASER INDEMNITEE TO A THIRD
PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM, WITH RESPECT TO CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (REGARDLESS OF THE CHARACTERIZATION THEREOF), DAMAGES
CONSISTING OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOST PROFITS, DAMAGES COMPUTED ON A
MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS, BOOK VALUE OR ANY SIMILAR BASIS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN USED
IN ARRIVING AT THE PURCHASE PRICE OR WHICH MAY BE REFLECTIVE OF THE EQUITY
VALUE OF THE COMPANY, AND INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES;

(ii) with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation and
warranty or covenant by or of the Company or Seller which is contained herein
if as of Closing, any of the Purchaser Knowledge Parties had actual knowledge
of the misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant. " _Purchaser
Knowledge Parties_ " means Jeffrey Kenner and Thomas Wolf;

(iii) with respect to the failure to obtain any consent or approval or to
satisfy any conditions imposed incident to the giving of any consent or
approval, required in connection with, or as a consequence of,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including without limitation with respect to any contracts, permits or
industry certifications, except with respect to any consent or approval that
was required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule by the express terms
of _Section 2.3(e)_, but was not so disclosed;

(iv) to the extent the matter in question does not exceed the amount of any
reserves or liabilities with respect to such matters which are reflected in
the Closing Balance Sheet or taken into account in the calculation of the
Purchase Price; and/or

(v) without limiting the generality of subparagraph (iv), with respect to any
Damages or alleged Damages if: (A) the Working Capital calculated with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet was reduced for such Damages or (B) the
parties expressly agreed or the Arbitrating Accountant determined that Working
Capital calculated with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet should not be
reduced for such Damages.

SECTION 8.5 _Purchaser s Indemnification Covenants_. From and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify, save and keep Seller and its
directors, managers, officers, members, stockholders, and Affiliates (the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ ") harmless against and from all Damages sustained or
incurred by any Seller Indemnitee, as a result of or arising out of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty made by
Purchaser or Holdings to Seller herein or in any closing document delivered
to Seller in connection herewith; and

(b) any breach by Purchaser or Holdings of, or failure by Purchaser or
Holdings to comply with, any of the covenants or obligations under this
Agreement to be performed by Purchaser and/or Holdings (including without
limitation its obligations under this _Article VIII_ ).

SECTION 8.6 _Notice and Determination of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party
believes that it has suffered or incurred any Damages, whether or not
the applicable dollar limitation specified by  



 

34   _Article VIII_ has been exceeded, such Indemnified Party shall so notify
the Indemnifying Party promptly in writing (the " _Claim Notice_ ")
specifying the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Partys claim for
indemnification is asserted and describing such Damages, the amount thereof,
if known, or a good faith estimate of the amount, and the method
of computation of such Damages, all with reasonable particularity. After the
giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of indemnification to
which a person shall be entitled under this _Article VIII_ shall be
determined: (a) by the written agreement between the parties; (b) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) by any other
means to which the parties shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court
shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired
and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been
finally determined. The indemnified person shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Damages suffered by it. A failure by an
Indemnified Party to give timely, complete or accurate notice as provided in
this _Article VIII_ will not affect the rights or obligations of any party
hereunder except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure,
any party entitled to receive such notice was materially damaged as a result
of such failure to give timely notice _vis- a-vis_ its rights and obligations
hereunder or otherwise.

SECTION 8.7 _Third-Party Claims_.

(a) Promptly following the receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim, the
party receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim shall notify the other
party of its existence setting forth with reasonable specificity the facts and
circumstances of which such party has received notice and, if the party
giving such notice is an Indemnified Party, specifying the basis hereunder
upon which the Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification is asserted and
describing such Damages, the amount thereof, if known, or a good faith
estimate of the amount, and the method of computation of such Damages, all
with reasonable particularity. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of
all documents and information relevant to the Third-Party Claim and in the
Indemnified Partys possession.

(b) Subject to _Section 8.7(d)_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense,
compromise and settlement of any Third Party Claim as to which indemnification
is sought by any Indemnified Party from any Indemnifying Party hereunder. The
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing, as promptly
as possible (but in any case before the due date for the answer or response to
the Third Party Claim) after receipt of the notice of Third Party Claim given
by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party under _Section 8.7(a)_ of
its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in
the defense of any such Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party
has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof. The Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in connection with the defense, compromise or settlement
of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this  _Section 8.7 _and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith. 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party written notice of
the Indemnifying Partys intention to settle any Third Party Claim at least
10 days prior to the settlement of any such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise such claim or demand without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, unless the Indemnified Party is given a full and
complete release of any and all liability by all relevant parties to such
claim or demand or the damages payable under the settlement are limited to
monetary payments for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim, _provided_ that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive
any right to indemnity therefor hereunder.



 

35 (d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 8.7(b)_ to the contrary, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control, through
counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third
Party Claim that seeks as the sole remedy an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party. Additionally, the Indemnifying Party
shall lose its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle the Third Party
Claim if it shall fail to accept a tender of the defense of the Third Party
Claim or if it shall fail to diligently contest the Third Party Claim. In
such event, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control,
through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of any
such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that at least 10 days prior
to any such settlement, written notice of its intention to settle is given to
the Indemnifying Party.

SECTION 8.8  _Obligations to Mitigate Damages_. Each Indemnified Party shall
take, and shall cause all other Indemnified Parties to take, all commercially
reasonable best efforts to mitigate all Damages upon and after becoming aware
of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages. In
the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnified Party
with respect to any Damages for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall
be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party.

SECTION 8.9 _Indemnification Exclusive Remedy_. Indemnification pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the parties with respect to any matters arising under or relating to this
Agreement, any closing document executed and delivered pursuant to the
provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
only legal action which may be asserted by any party with respect to any
matter which is the subject of this _Article VIII_ shall be a contract
action to enforce, or to recover damages for the breach of, this _Article
VIII_. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, no legal
action sounding in tort or strict liability may be maintained by any party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this _Section
8.9_ shall not apply to any claim for Damages as a result of or arising out of
or by virtue of willful and wanton actual fraud of any party hereto and shall
not apply to any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any rights of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the
Company) under the terms of the Promissory Note and/or the Preferred Stock.

SECTION 8.10 _Environmental Claims_. Upon any Purchaser Indemnitee becoming
aware of the occurrence of any event or the existence of any state of facts
in respect of which Purchaser Indemnitee may seek indemnification with respect
to a claim under _Section 8.3(g)_ or for breach of any of the representations
and warranties contained in _Section 2.3(u)_ (an " _Environmental
Indemnification Claim_ "), thereafter:

(a) Purchaser Indemnitee will give to Seller prompt written notice specifying
in reasonable detail the basis for the Environmental Indemnification Claim;

(b) Purchaser Indemnitee will promptly deliver to Seller copies of all draft
and final environmental reports, studies, surveys, test data and reports,
assessments, cost estimates and all other information available to it or the
Company or the Subsidiaries relating to or supporting the
Environmental Indemnification Claim excluding any legal analysis prepared for
Purchaser Indemnitee of any associated liabilities relating to the
Environmental Indemnification Claim but excepting therefrom any factual or
supporting documentation or information upon which the legal analysis is
based and which such factual or supporting documentation or information shall
be promptly delivered to Seller;

(c) Purchaser Indemnitee, the Company and the Subsidiaries will provide
advance written notification of each and every proposed test, investigation or
inspection or retention of any consultant to perform testing, investigation or
inspection relating to any potential or actual Environmental Indemnification
Claim (" _Proposed Investigation_ ") including the basis for undertaking the
Proposed Investigation and provide the Seller a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proposed  



 

36  Investigation prior to initiating the Proposed Investigation; provided,
however, that no advance written notification of the Proposed Investigation
shall be required in the event of an imminent threat to the health, safety or
welfare of employees or the public (an " _Imminent Threat_ ") or in response
to an immediate government demand to take some corrective action (a
"Government Demand"), in which case Purchaser Indemnitee shall provide
written notice to Seller of the Proposed Investigation as soon as reasonably
possible thereafter;

(d) Except in the case of an Imminent Threat or a Government Demand, Purchaser
Indemnitee, the Company and/or the Subsidiaries shall give Seller reasonable
prior written notice of any discussions between any Purchaser Indemnitee, the
Company and/or the Subsidiaries (or any representative or advisor thereof) and
any governmental authority relating to any Environmental Indemnification Claim
and/or an event or the existence of the state of facts that may give rise to
a potential Environmental Indemnification Claim and Seller shall be entitled
to participate in such discussions;

(e) Purchaser Indemnitee shall cause to be furnished to Seller drafts of all
proposed investigation, remediation or other response plans relating to an
Environmental Indemnification Claim and/or an event or the existence of the
state of facts that may give rise to a potential Environmental
Indemnification Claim not less than ten business days prior to (i) the date on
which they are required to be submitted to any applicable governmental
authorities (except in the case of an Imminent Threat or a Government Demand,
in which case, Purchaser Indemnitee shall provide drafts a reasonable time in
advance of submission) or (ii) the date on which the investigation or
remediation activities are to be commenced, as applicable, and shall
give Seller a reasonable opportunity to comment on such draft plans, and
shall adopt all reasonable changes proposed by Seller or their representatives
thereto except to the extent such changes would be inconsistent with existing
law;

(f) With respect to any Environmental Indemnification Claim involving any
proposed remedial action to bring the Real Property into compliance with
such Environmental Laws (a " _Response Action_ "), Purchaser Indemnitee shall
use any alternative that: (i) is necessary to achieve compliance with
Environmental Laws; (ii) uses the most cost-effective, commercially
reasonable approach that complies with Environmental laws assuming the
continued use of the Real Property for similar commercial and industrial uses
present as of the Closing Date; and (iii) to the extent allowed by
Environmental Laws, uses institutional controls, containment remedies or
other remedies which do not require excavation and disposal of hazardous
substances, unless such control, containment or other remedy are reasonably
expected to interfere with the continued use of the Real Property for similar
commercial or industrial uses present as of the Closing Date or creates an
unreasonable risk of migration of hazardous substances to adjacent properties
(the " _Reasonable Alternative_ "). In no event shall any
Purchaser Indemnitee be entitled to indemnity for: (i) any Response Action
costs in excess of the costs of the Reasonable Alternative, and/or (ii) any
costs for a Response Action intended to exceed applicable clean-up levels
assuming the continued use of the Real Property for similar commercial and
industrial uses present as of the Closing Date established by or under
Environmental Laws. All costs and expenses for such Response Action shall be,
to the extent possible, reasonable and customary charges in the location of
the Real Property or off-site facility for the type and kind of services to be
rendered;

(g) Purchaser Indemnitee, the Company and the Subsidiaries will permit
representatives of Seller (including advisors and consultants) to visit and
inspect from time to time any of the properties to which any such
Environmental Indemnification Claim relates, and to enter on such properties
from time to time for the purpose of conducting such duplicate or split-sample
environmental tests as Seller may reasonably desire with respect to the
Environmental Indemnification Claim. All such visits, inspections
and sampling shall be solely at the risk and expense of Seller or its
advisors and consultant and shall be during normal business hours, in manners
and at times that do not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the
Company and the Subsidiaries; 



 

37 (h) Seller may elect to assume control over defending, remedying, managing,
compromising or settling, through counsel, consultant, or contractor of its
choosing, any Environmental Indemnification Claim not involving investigation
or remedial action on the Real Property; provided that Purchaser Indemnitee
may participate at its own expense, through counsel of its choice, in the
defense of any such Environmental Indemnification Claim as to which Seller has
so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof; provided further that
Seller will only have the rights to such election if made by Seller in
writing within thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of written notice from
Purchaser Indemnitee of such Environmental Indemnification Claim and to the
extent performed diligently and without unreasonable delay.
Purchaser Indemnitee shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall
furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and appeals as may be reasonably
requested by Seller in connection therewith; and

(i) A failure by Purchaser, the Company and Subsidiaries or any Purchaser
Indemnitee to perform any obligation under this  _Section 8.10_ will not
affect the rights or obligations of either party hereunder unless the other
party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to perform the
obligation _vis- a-vis_ its rights and obligations hereunder or otherwise.

copies of such claim and all other writings received from the government or
taxing authority related to such claim. Any contest pursuant to this section
shall be subject to the control and prosecution of Seller, subject to the
reasonable notice and approval of Purchaser.

Directors_ ") may determine. All shares of Common Stock shall be of equal rank
and shall be identical.

(b) _Liquidation Rights_. In the event of a Liquidation of the Corporation and
after all required payments to holders of Preferred Stock, the holders of

assets available for distribution to the holders of Common Stock ratably in
proportion to the total number of shares of Common Stock then issued and
outstanding.

(c) _Voting Rights_. The holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote
per share in voting or consenting to the election of directors and for all
other corporate purposes to the extent authorized by this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or the GCL.

2\. _Serial Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly
authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by law, by resolution
or resolutions and by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of
the State of Delaware, to provide, out of the unissued shares of Preferred
Stock, for series of Preferred Stock in addition to the Series A Preferred
Stock, and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included
in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and
rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereof.

The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series of
Preferred Stock in addition to Series A Preferred Stock shall include, but not
be limited to, determination of the following:

(a) The number of shares constituting that series and the distinctive
designation of that series;

(b) The rate of dividend, and whether (and if so, on what terms and
conditions) dividends shall be cumulative (and if so, whether unpaid
dividends shall compound or accrue) or shall be payable in preference or in
any other relation to the dividends payable on any other class or classes of

(d) Whether the shares must or may be redeemed and, if so, the terms and
conditions of such redemption (including, without limitation, the dates upon
or after which they must or may be redeemed and the price or prices at which
they must or may be redeemed, which price or prices may be different in
different circumstances or at different redemption dates);



 

2 (e) Whether the shares shall be issued with the privilege of conversion or
exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange
(including without limitation the price or prices or the rate or rates of
conversion or exchange or any terms for adjustment thereof);

(f) The amounts, if any, payable under the shares thereof in the event of the
Liquidation of the Corporation in preference of shares of any other class or
series and whether the shares shall be entitled to participate generally in
distributions in the Common Stock under such circumstances;

(g) Sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or purchase of the
shares (the term "sinking fund" being understood to include any similar fund,
however designated); and

(h) Any other relative rights, preferences, limitations and powers of that
series.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, for as long
as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, all Preferred
Stock issued under this paragraph 2 of ARTICLE FOURTH shall be Junior Stock
with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock.

3\. _Series A Preferred Stock_. The Series A Preferred Stock, consisting
of 25,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, has the preferences and
relative and other rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof, as follows:

(a) _Dividends_.

(1) Commencing on the initial Dividend Accrual Date, cumulative annual
dividends shall accrue on each share of issued and outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock in an amount equal to 8% of the Dividend Base Amount per
share, compounded annually, whether or not declared or paid, and regardless of
whether there are profits, surplus or other funds legally available for
payment of dividends. Accrual of such dividends shall be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and shall accrue and compound
annually in arrears on each Dividend Accrual Date. Dividends shall be paid in
full in cash when the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemed by the
Corporation in the manner provided in _paragraph 3(d)_ of this ARTICLE FOURTH.

(2) All dividends paid with respect to shares of Series A Preferred Stock
pursuant to this paragraph 3(a) shall be paid pro rata to the holders
entitled thereto. In the event that the funds legally available therefor shall
be insufficient for the payment of the entire amount of cash dividends payable
at any Dividend Accrual Date, subject to this paragraph 3(a), such funds shall
be allocated for the payment of dividends with respect to the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock pro rata based upon the sum of the Liquidation
Preference of the outstanding shares plus accrued but unpaid dividends
thereon.



 

3 (b) _Priority; Restrictions on Dividends and Redemption_. The Series A
Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend rights, redemption rights,
rights on Liquidation and rights upon a Redemption Triggering Event, rank
senior to all Junior Stock.

(1) _Dividends_. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, the Corporation shall not (i) declare, or pay, with respect to
any Junior Stock, any dividend whatsoever, whether in cash, property or
otherwise (other than dividends payable in shares of the class or series of
such Junior Stock upon which such dividends are declared or paid), or (ii)
make any distribution with respect to any Junior Stock, provided, that
the accrual of dividends on Junior Stock will not be restricted by the
foregoing.

(2) _Redemption_. The Corporation shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire
for value any Junior Stock (or pay, set aside or make available any money for
the purchase or redemption thereof) unless, at the time of making such
redemption, purchase or other acquisition, the Corporation shall have
redeemed, or shall contemporaneously redeem, all of the then outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the applicable redemption price as set
forth in  _paragraph 3(d)_ of this ARTICLE FOURTH; provided, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no redemption default by the
Corporation has occurred and is continuing under _paragraph 3(d)(1)_ of this
ARTICLE FOURTH, the Corporation may repurchase shares of Capital Stock or
other Equity Interests held by bona fide full-time employees of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for cash, junior notes or any
combination thereof in connection with the death, disability or termination
of employment of such employees or any plan or agreement governing the
Corporations issuance of option or other equity-based awards to employees.

(3) _Restrictions under Senior Credit Agreements and Law_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the Corporation shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary
of the Corporation to, make any dividends or distribution with respect to, or
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, any shares of
Capital Stock of the Corporation, unless the Corporation is permitted to do
so under both (i) the Senior Credit Agreements and (ii) 8 Del. C. §170 of the
GCL; _provided_ that the Corporation shall make any dividend or distribution
or purchase or otherwise acquire such shares for consideration as otherwise
required under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as soon
as it is permitted to do so under both (i) the Senior Credit Agreements and
(ii) 8 Del. C. §170 of the GCL.

(c) _Distributions Upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_. In the event
of any Liquidation, but before any distribution or payment shall be made to
the holders of Junior Stock, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to be paid, in cash, out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders, an amount equal to the
aggregate Liquidation Preference of all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock plus accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to such shares
of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed as of the date of such
Liquidation. If, upon any such Liquidation, the assets of the Corporation
distributable to the holders of all outstanding shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock  



 

4  shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full to such holders of the
preferential amounts to which they are entitled, then the entire assets of
the Corporation shall be distributed to the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise
be respectively entitled. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a
Redemption Triggering Event, shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation of the
Corporation for purposes of this _paragraph 3(c)_ , it being understood that
any redemption payments or distributions on or in respect of the Corporations
Capital Stock or other Equity Interests that are made in connection with a
Redemption Triggering Event pursuant to _paragraph 3(d)_ of this ARTICLE
FOURTH shall be distributed in accordance with the same priority as applied in
a Liquidation.

Written notice of any Liquidation, stating a payment date and the place where
the distributive amounts shall be payable, shall be given in accordance with
_paragraph 3(f)(2)_ of this ARTICLE FOURTH, not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of the
Series A Preferred Stock at their respective addresses as the same shall
appear on the books of the Corporation.

(d) _Redemption by the Corporation_.

(1) Subject to _paragraph 3(b)(3)_ of this ARTICLE FOURTH, the Corporation
shall redeem all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the
date that is the earlier of: (i) a Redemption Triggering Event, or (ii) the
seventh anniversary of the Issue Date, at a price per share equal to the Face
Amount plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon as of the redemption date
(subject to the remaining provisions of this _paragraph 3(d)(1)_ , the "
_Series A Redemption Price_ "). If a Redemption Triggering Event shall occur
prior to December 31, 2011, then the "Face Amount" shall be deemed to be
$25,000,000 and the Series A Redemption Price payable upon such Redemption
Triggering Event shall equal $25,000,000 plus accrued but unpaid dividends at
a rate of 8% per annum on such amount from the Issue Date through
and including the redemption date, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the definition of "Face Amount" in _paragraph 3(n)_ of this ARTICLE FOURTH.

(2) The Corporation may redeem all then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock at any time at a price per share equal to $25,000,000,
payable in full in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, plus
all accrued but unpaid dividends at a rate of 8% per annum on such amount from
the Issue Date through and including the redemption date.

(3) Notice of every proposed redemption of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
sent by or on behalf of the Corporation to the holders of record of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock so to be redeemed prior to the date fixed
for redemption (the " _Series A Redemption Date_ "), which Series A Redemption
Date shall be no sooner than 30 days and no later than 60 days from such
notice, (i) notifying such holders of the election or obligation of the
Corporation to redeem such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and of the
Series A Redemption Date, (ii) stating the place or places at which the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption shall, upon presentation
and surrender of the certificates evidencing such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, be  



 

5  redeemed, and the Series A Redemption Price therefor, and (iii) stating that
unless the Corporation defaults in making the redemption payment,
dividends on the Dividend Base Amount shall cease to accrue on the Series A
Redemption Date.

(4) If the Corporation fails to make a full payment or delivery as aforesaid

pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, including, without limitation, an action by
or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of his acting as a director or
officer of the Corporation (and the Corporation, in the discretion of the
Board of Directors, may so indemnify a person by reason of the fact that he
is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation in any other capacity for or on behalf of the

incurred by such person in respect thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the

connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by

thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a
defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim
for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where any undertaking required by the By laws of the Corporation
has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the
standards of conduct which make it permissible under the GCL and
subdivision (a) of this _paragraph 1_ of this ARTICLE FIFTH for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of
the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
GCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

(c) Indemnification shall include payment by the Corporation of expenses in
defending an action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such
action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by the person indemnified
to repay such payment if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification under this ARTICLE FIFTH, which undertaking may be
accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make
such repayment.

6\. _Insurance_. The Corporation shall have the power (but not the obligation)
to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss incurred by such person in any such
capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under this
ARTICLE FIFTH or the GCL. 

7\. _Other Rights_. The rights and authority conferred in this ARTICLE FIFTH
shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may otherwise have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, By-law, agreement, contract, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

8\. _Additional Indemnification_. The Corporation may, by action of its Board
of Directors, provide indemnification to such of the directors, officers,
employees and agents of the Corporation to such extent and to such effect as
the Board of Directors shall determine to be appropriate and authorized by the
GCL.

  

 

16 9\. _Effect of Amendments_. Neither the amendment, change, alteration nor
repeal of this ARTICLE FIFTH, nor the adoption of any provision of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By laws of the
Corporation, nor, to the fullest extent permitted by GCL, any modification of
law, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this ARTICLE FIFTH or the rights
or any protection afforded under this ARTICLE FIFTH in respect of any acts or
omissions occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, adoption or modification.

_SIXTH_ : At all meetings of stockholders, each stockholder shall be entitled
to vote, in person or by proxy, the shares of voting stock owned by such
stockholders of record on the record date for the meeting. When a quorum is
present or represented at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority
in interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy at such meeting
and entitled to vote thereon shall decide any question, matter or proposal
brought before such meeting unless the question is one upon which, by express
provision of law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
the By laws applicable thereto, a different vote is required, in which case
such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.

_SEVENTH_ : 

10\. _Number of Directors_. The number of directors of the Corporation shall
be fixed from time to time by the vote of a majority of the entire Board of
Directors, but such number shall in no case be less than one (1). Any such
determination made by the Board of Directors shall continue in effect unless
and until changed by the Board of Directors, but no such changes shall
affect the term of any directors then in office.

11\. _Term of Office; Quorum; Vacancies_. A director shall hold office until
the annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until
his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to
prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.
Subject to the By laws, a majority of the entire Board of Directors shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Any vacancies and newly
created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors
shall be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office even
though less than a quorum and shall hold office until his successor is elected
and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office.

12\. _Removal_. Subject to the By-laws, any director may be removed upon the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes which could be
cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to
vote for the election of directors given at a duly called annual or special
meeting of stockholders.

_EIGHTH_ : For the management of the business and for the conduct of the
affairs of the Corporation, and in further definition, limitation
and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and of
its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further
provided:

(1) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors.



 

17 (2) The directors shall have the power, subject to the terms and conditions of
the By-laws of Corporation, to make, adopt, alter, amend, change, add to or
repeal the By-laws of the Corporation.

(3) In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the GCL, this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-laws adopted by
the stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that no By-Laws hereafter adopted
by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which
would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

_NINTH_ :

13\. _Stockholder Meetings; Keeping of Books and Records_. Meetings of
stockholders may be held within or outside the State of Delaware as the By
laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any
provision contained in the GCL) outside the State of Delaware at such place or
places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in
the By laws of the Corporation.

14\. _Special Stockholders Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders,
for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by law, may be
called by the President or the Chairman of the Board, if one is elected, and
shall be called by the Secretary at the direction of a majority of the Board
of Directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders owning a majority
in amount of the Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote.

15\. _No Written Ballot_. Elections of directors need not be by written
ballot unless the By laws of the Corporation shall so provide.

_TENTH_ : No repeal, alteration or amendment of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall be made unless the same is first approved
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation pursuant to a resolution adopted
by the directors then in office in accordance with the By laws and applicable
law and thereafter approved by the stockholders to the extent required by
applicable law; provided that any amendment to (i) ARTICLE FOURTH herein or
(ii) any other provision herein that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect (economically or otherwise) the powers, preferences or
rights of the Series A Preferred Stock or the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock, shall require the prior written approval of a majority of the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock. 

_TWELFTH_ : The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed under Section
203 of the GCL. This election took effect on June 24, 2008.



 

18 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned officer of the Corporation has executed
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation on behalf of the
Corporation this 15th day of July, 2008.
