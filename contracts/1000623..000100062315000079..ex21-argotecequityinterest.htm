accordance with the Company Accounting Principles.

(b) Within forty-five (45) days after delivery to Seller of the Buyer
Calculation, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written notice either (i)
advising Buyer that Seller agrees with and accepts the Buyer Calculation,
which shall then become the final determination of the Closing Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness Payoff Amount, Seller Transaction
Expenses and Transaction Bonus Amount (which, without limiting Section
11.2(a)(v), shall not be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment,
absent common law fraud) for purposes of this Section 2.6, or (ii) setting
forth a reasonably detailed explanation of those items in the Buyer
Calculation that Seller disputes and a statement, with reasonable detail as to
the disputed matters, of what Seller believes is the correct calculation of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Seller
Transaction Expenses and Transaction Bonus Amount (the "Seller Calculation"),
which shall be in the form of the Closing Statement and shall be calculated in
accordance with the Company Accounting Principles. The only disputes that
Seller may include are disputes that (A) the Buyer Calculation was not
calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Company
Accounting Principles and (B) the Buyer Calculation includes mathematical
errors. All items not disputed by Seller will become final and binding upon
delivery of the Seller Calculation for purposes of this Section 2.6. If Seller
fails to provide notice either accepting or disputing the Buyer Calculation
within the forty-five (45) day timeframe, the Buyer Calculation will become
final and binding on the Parties in all respects for purposes of this Section
2.6. Seller and the accountants engaged by Seller, if any, shall be entitled
to review the Company's working papers, trial balances and similar materials
(excluding any working papers or similar materials prepared by independent
auditors engaged by Buyer or the Company) relating to the Company's
preparation of its balance sheet as of the Closing Date, if any, for purposes
of reviewing the Buyer Calculation. The Company shall also provide Seller and
its accountants with (1) the assistance of the Company's personnel and (2)
timely access, during the Company's normal business hours, to the Company's
personnel, properties, books and records for purposes of Seller's review of
the Buyer Calculation, such access to be provided without charge to Seller. In
no case shall Buyer be required to afford Seller or any of its representatives
access to the Company or its personnel or books and records in a manner that
unreasonably interferes with the Company's business or operations.

(c) In the event that Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any disputes
regarding the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness
Payoff Amount, Seller Transaction Expenses or Transaction Bonus Amount within
forty-five (45) days after the date Buyer receives the Seller Calculation,
then such disputes shall be referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or another
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller (the "Settlement
Accountants"). Seller and Buyer shall instruct the Settlement Accountants to
reach a determination as to the disputed matters not more than forty-five (45)
days after such referral. Within fifteen (15) Business Days following such
referral, Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Settlement Accountants (and the
other Party) documentary materials and analyses that Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, believes support its respective position relating to the disputed
matters set forth in the Buyer Calculation or Seller Calculation, but
excluding any work papers of independent certified public accountants. The
determination of the Settlement Accountants shall be final and binding for
purposes of this Section 2.6 and, without limiting Section 11.2(a)(v), shall
not be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment, absent common law
fraud or a scrivener's or mechanical error. Nothing herein, however, shall be
construed to authorize or permit the Settlement Accountants to resolve any
dispute by making an adjustment to the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness Payoff Amount, Seller Transaction Expenses or Transaction
Bonus Amount, as applicable, that is outside of the issues or the range
defined by the Buyer Calculation and the Seller Calculation. In the event the
Settlement Accountant agrees entirely with either the Buyer Calculation or the
Seller Calculation, then the non-prevailing party shall be responsible for all
of the fees and expenses of the Settlement Accountant (and in such case the
non-prevailing promptly shall promptly (i) pay to the Settlement Accountant
all such fees and expenses then due and owing and (ii) if applicable,
reimburse the prevailing party for any portion of such fees and expenses
already paid by the prevailing party); otherwise, the fees and expenses of the
Settlement Account shall be split proportionally, as determined by the
Settlement Accountant, between Buyer and Seller based on the difference (when
compared to each other) between each Party's calculation and the final
resolution by the Settlement Accountant (and each party shall promptly pay to
the Settlement Accountant such party's proportionate share of such fees and
expenses then due and owing). The date on which the Final Working Capital,
Final Cash, Final Closing Indebtedness Payoff Amount, Final Seller Transaction
Expenses and Final Transaction Bonus Amount are agreed or finally determined
is referred to as the "Determination Date".

(d) No later than five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date, Seller
or Buyer, as the case may be, shall make the following payments, after
netting, without duplication, against each other all payments required to be
made by Seller and/or Buyer, as the case may be, pursuant to clauses (i)

applicable Person(s) via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the

amount equal to the difference;

(ii) if the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Final Working
Capital, then Seller shall deliver to Buyer an amount equal to the difference;

(iii) if the Final Cash is greater than the Estimated Cash, then Buyer shall,

Company to, deliver to Seller an amount equal to the difference;

Estimated Closing Indebtedness Payoff Amount, then Seller shall deliver to
Buyer an amount equal to the difference;

(vii) if the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses is greater than the Final
Seller Transaction Expenses, then Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to,
deliver to Seller an amount equal to the difference;

(viii) if the Final Seller Transaction Expenses is greater than the Estimated

to the difference.

If pursuant to this Section 2.6(d) Buyer is required to make a payment to
Seller, Buyer and Seller shall deliver to the Escrow Agent no later than five
(5) Business Days after the Determination Date, an instruction to the Escrow
Agent to release from the Escrow Account to Seller an amount equal to the

Buyer access to their customers for Customer Interviews, as and to the extent
provided in the final sentence of this Section 6.2(a). From and after the Cut

to have a representative participate in any call between Buyer and such
Specified Customers and Buyer shall not discuss any topics, other than those
set forth on Schedule 6.2(a)(ii) (the "Specified Categories") with such
Specified Customers, without the Company's consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (ii) with respect to any
customers or suppliers other than the Specified Customers, only with the prior
consent of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, (A)
from and after the Cut Bait Time, Buyer may communicate with any customers or

reasonable efforts to allow a representative of the Company to participate in
calls with such customers or suppliers, and (2) does not affirmatively raise
topics not included in the Specified Categories during such communications;
and (B) the restrictions on customer and supplier contact in this Section
6.2(a) do not apply to contact with customers, suppliers or other business
relations of Buyer or any of its Affiliates relating solely to the conduct of
Buyer's business. In connection with any access provided pursuant to this
Section 6.2(a), Buyer and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company

of Intermediate LLC, the Company and the Subsidiaries resulting from such
access. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
6.2(a), prior to Closing, (x) Buyer shall not have access to individual
medical histories (including any protected health information) or other
information the disclosure of which, in the Company's reasonable opinion,
would violate applicable Law or could reasonably be expected to subject
Intermediate LLC, the Company or the Subsidiaries to risk of Liability, (y)
Buyer shall not be entitled to conduct any invasive sampling or testing with
respect to the properties of any Person without the prior written consent of
Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and (z) nothing herein shall require Seller, Intermediate LLC, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to furnish to Buyer or provide Buyer with access to
information that legal counsel for Seller, Intermediate LLC, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries reasonably conclude may give rise to a violation of
antitrust or competition Laws or that is subject to attorney-client privilege.
Seller, Argotec Holdings and the Acquired Companies shall use their reasonable
best efforts to provide Buyer with the opportunity to conduct interviews with
five of the Specified Customers and may only ask such customers the questions
within the Specified Categories (each such interview, a "Customer Interview")
in each case at times reasonably convenient for Buyer and in no event later
than 5:00 p.m. New York City Time on Monday, September 21, 2015.

(j) Access to Company Property.

(i) From the date hereof through Closing, subject to any confidentiality

times as the Company shall find satisfactory; provided, however, that neither
Buyer nor any representative or agent of Buyer shall be permitted to perform
any invasive environmental investigation, including soil or groundwater
sampling without the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "Real Property Access").
With regard to any Real Property Access, Buyer shall conduct all audits,
examinations and inspections of the Company Property in a manner that will not
materially harm or damage the Company Property and in compliance with
applicable Law. Buyer shall restore the Company Property to its condition
prior to any such audits, examinations or inspections promptly after
conducting the same, and repair promptly any damage to the Company Property
caused by Buyer or any representative or agent of Buyer. With respect to any
invasive environmental investigation, Buyer will: (i) submit to Seller for its
approval a work plan that generally describes the type and extent of such
planned investigation and (ii) obtain, and maintain, for so long as Buyer
intends to enter upon the Company Property, insurance coverage demonstrating
that Buyer or its representatives who will conduct such investigation have
appropriate insurance coverage for the type of investigation proposed by Buyer
with minimum limits of $1,000,000.00 for each type of coverage, naming Seller
as an additional insured under all such coverage, and furnishing Seller with
additional insured endorsements and certificates evidencing such coverage
prior to conducting any investigation. Seller will have the right, but not the
obligation, to accompany Buyer during such investigation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold
Seller harmless from any and all damages to property of the Acquired Companies
(or injuries to any employees of the Acquired Companies) caused by Buyer
during Buyer's invasive environmental investigation on any property of the
Acquired Companies pursuant to this Section 6.2. The provisions of this
Section 6.2(b) shall survive any pre-Closing termination of this Agreement,
but shall terminate at Closing.

writing of any event, condition, fact or circumstance (a) that would make the
timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article IX
impossible or unlikely, (b) which, if existing or occurring prior to the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or (c) which would have been required to be set forth in
the Company Disclosure Schedule hereto if the Knowledge of the Company on the
Closing Date were the Knowledge of the Company on the date hereof (such
notification, a "Disclosure Schedule Supplement"). No Disclosure Schedule
Supplement shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure
Schedule in any respect, including for the purpose of (i) determining the
accuracy of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III
and Article IV of this Agreement (except that the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV of this Agreement shall be
deemed amended by a Disclosure Schedule Supplement solely for purposes of
determining the right of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to indemnification
under Article XI in the event that (A) the facts disclosed in such Disclosure
Schedule Supplement (and the matters that caused such facts) arose after the
date hereof, (B) the facts set forth in such Disclosure Schedule Supplement
give rise to a termination right in favor of Buyer pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(iii) relating to a breach of a representation or warranty by the
Company that arose after the date hereof and such Disclosure Schedule
Supplement is accompanied by written notice from Seller that the facts set
forth in the Disclosure Schedule Supplement give rise to a termination right
in favor of Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1 and provides the same level of
specificity with respect to the facts described therein as the Disclosure
Schedules dated the date hereof (such notice, a "Termination Right Notice"),
(C) Buyer has at least five Business Days after the date such Disclosure
Schedule Supplement is received to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(a)(iii), (D) from and after the delivery of such Disclosure
Schedule Supplement, Seller, Argotec Holdings and the Acquired Companies
provide to Buyer any access to any of them or their personnel or
representatives requested by Buyer in connection with such Disclosure Schedule
Supplement, (E) Seller shall have conducted good faith negotiations regarding
a Purchase Price adjustment relating to such Disclosure Schedule Supplement
during such five (5) Business Day period and (F) Buyer does not terminate this
Agreement; or (ii) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in
Article IX.

their diligent reasonable efforts to (a) promptly prepare the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at September
30, 2015 and the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows of
the Acquired Companies for the trailing twelve months then ended in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied; (b) deliver a copy of such financial
statements to Buyer promptly following completion of such financial statements
and in any event no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date; (c)
provide "Monthly Financial Statements" regarding the Acquired Companies as the

Ordinary Course of Business; and (d) at Buyer's expense, cooperate in the
preparation of pro forma and interim financial information for filing with,
and request and obtain the consent of the Acquired Companies' independent
auditor for use of their reports in, any applicable Securities and Exchange
Commission filings of Buyer and its Affiliates. Seller and the Acquired
Companies shall provide such other reasonable cooperation to Buyer as Buyer,
at Buyer's expense, may request in connection with the preparation by Buyer of
financial and other reporting materials. From the date hereof until Closing,
Seller and the Acquired Companies shall provide commercially reasonable
assistance to Buyer, at Buyer's expense, with respect to the efforts of Buyer
and its Affiliates to obtain financing.

ARTICLE VII 
OTHER COVENANTS

7.1. Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that the information being provided
to it in connection with the consummation of the Transaction is subject to the
terms of the non-disclosure agreement between Buyer and the Company dated
January 22, 2015 (the "Non-Disclosure Agreement"), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or
effect.

7.2. WARN Act. Seller agrees to provide, and shall cause Intermediate LLC, the
Company and the Subsidiaries (as applicable), to provide, any required notice
under and to otherwise comply with, and to retain and be liable for all
Liabilities relating to, the entire or partial closure or cessation of
operations at, or reduction in workforce at, any facility, location or other
site of employment of Seller, Intermediate LLC, the Company and the
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing Date (it being understood and
agreed that Seller is not making any representation in this Section 7.2 with
respect to its compliance with the WARN Act with respect to periods prior to
the date hereof), including such facilities in Massachusetts, and further
including, any Liabilities under the WARN Act and any similar state and local
Law. Buyer shall be liable for any Liabilities under the WARN Act or any other
Law respecting reductions in force or the impact on employees of plant
closings or sales of businesses for any actions taken by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing Date.

7.3. Comparability of Employee Benefits. For a period of 12 months following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide or shall cause Intermediate LLC, the
Company and the Subsidiaries to provide, all individuals who are employees of
the Company and the Subsidiaries at the Closing Date (the "Assumed
Employees"), while they remain employees of the Company, any Subsidiary or
Buyer, with base compensation that is not less than that in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date and employee benefits that are at least as favorable
in the aggregate to those in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date
(other than any equity compensation arrangements and special bonus
arrangements, including transaction bonus arrangements) (it being understood
and agreed that Buyer may move Assumed Employees to the employee benefit plans
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates if doing so otherwise complies with Buyer's
obligations under this sentence). Buyer shall or shall cause Intermediate LLC,
the Company and the Subsidiaries to recognize all accrued but unused vacation
and sick pay of the Assumed Employees as of the Closing Date. Following the
Closing Date, each Assumed Employee shall receive full service credit for all
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes) for employment,
PTO (paid time off) and employee benefit plan purposes, if applicable. Buyer
shall provide Assumed Employees with full credit under Buyer's health and
welfare plans applicable to each Assumed Employee and his or her dependents
for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same
plan year as the Closing. Buyer shall waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions exclusions (or actively at work or similar limitations), evidence
of insurability requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to the Assumed Employees and their
eligible dependents under any health and welfare plan that such employees may
be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing to the contrary, none of the provisions contained herein shall
operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any Assumed Employee. This
Section 7.3 is for the benefit of Buyer and Seller to this Agreement only and
shall not be construed to grant any rights, as a third party beneficiary or
otherwise, to any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or to any
Assumed Employee, nor shall any provision of this Agreement be deemed to be
the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that term
is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise to limit the right of
Intermediate LLC, the Company, the Subsidiaries or Buyer to amend, modify or
terminate any such employee benefit plan. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.3 shall require Buyer, Intermediate LLC,
the Company or any Subsidiary to continue the employment of any Assumed
Employee for any period of time after the Closing. This Section 7.3 does not
override the required implementation and application of the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act.

7.4. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(d) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall cause each of Intermediate LLC, the Company, the Subsidiaries and
any of their successors or assigns to, indemnify, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing
Date were directors, managers or officers of such entities (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of Seller, Intermediate LLC, the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing Date.
Buyer agrees, for and on behalf of itself, Intermediate LLC, the Company, the
Subsidiaries or any of their successors or assigns, that all rights of the
Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the
respective Organizational Documents of such entities as now in effect, and any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of or on behalf of Intermediate
LLC, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, shall survive the Closing Date
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitees, unless such modification
is required by Law. In addition, Buyer shall, and shall cause Intermediate
LLC, the Company, or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay any expenses of
any Indemnitee under this Section 7.4, as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, provided that the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall ultimately
be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by
Intermediate LLC, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) Buyer, for the six year period after the Closing Date, shall cause the
Organizational Documents of Intermediate LLC, the Company and the Subsidiaries
to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of certain liabilities of directors, managers, officers, employees
and agents and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in such Organizational Documents, which provisions in each case
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.

(f) Each of Buyer, Intermediate LLC, the Company, the Subsidiaries and the
Indemnitee shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense of any Action as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

(g) Prior to Closing, the Acquired Companies shall purchase a fully prepaid
directors' and officers' liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance
program with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date
(such coverage to be on terms and conditions and for an amount not materially
less favorable to the Acquired Companies' directors, managers and officers
currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the
date hereof).

(h) The provisions of this Section 7.4: (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by Contract or otherwise.

(i) In the event that Buyer, Intermediate LLC, the Company, any Subsidiary or
any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer,
Intermediate LLC, the Company, and each Subsidiary (as the case may be) shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 7.4.

(j) The obligations of Buyer, Intermediate LLC, the Company, each Subsidiary
or any of their successors or assigns under this Section 7.4 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee
to whom this Section 7.4 applies without the consent of the affected
Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
Section 7.4 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.4).

(k) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this Section
7.4 shall not override or otherwise impair a Buyer Indemnified Party's right
to seek indemnification in accordance with Article XI, and, if any Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under Article XI
(without regard to the limitations contained in Article XI) with respect to
the same matter, no Indemnitee will be entitled to be exculpated, indemnified
or reimbursed, or receive advancement of any expenses, under the
Organizational Documents of Intermediate LLC, the Company, the Subsidiaries or
Buyer, this Agreement or otherwise, with respect to such matter.

7.5. Communications With Employees. Prior to Closing, no officer, director,
employee, agent or representative of any member of any Acquired Company,
Seller, Argotec Holdings, or Ultimate Equity Holder shall make any
communication to any employees of any Acquired Company regarding any
compensation or benefits to be provided after the Closing (except severance)
or any other matter with respect to the terms of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or relating to any post-Closing matter without the advance
written approval of Buyer.

7.6. Specified Annual Bonus Amounts.

(h) Seller shall deliver to Buyer, no later than four (4) Business Days prior
to Closing, an updated version of Schedule 1.1(a)(ii) for purposes of
reflecting a more accurate estimate of the pro rata amount of bonuses that
would be payable to the Assumed Employees for fiscal year 2015 if the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' performance through the Closing Date (but
excluding the effect of the Transaction) were continued for the balance of
fiscal year 2015. Subject to Buyer's approval of such updated Schedule (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such updated Schedule
1.1(a)(ii) shall replace the Schedule 1.1(a)(ii) attached hereto as of the
date of this Agreement and such updated Schedule 1.1(a)(ii) shall be deemed to
be Schedule 1.1(a)(ii) hereto for all purposes hereunder.

(i) In the event that an Assumed Employee listed on Schedule 1.1(a)(ii) is
paid either (i) no annual bonus for fiscal year 2015 or (ii) an annual bonus
for fiscal year 2015 in an amount less than the Specified Annual Bonus Amount
for such Assumed Employee, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, refund
to Seller an amount equal to the difference between (A) the Specified Annual
Bonus Amount for such Assumed Employee and (B) (1) the amount of the annual
bonus actually paid to such Assumed Employee for fiscal year 2015, if any
(such an amount with respect to such Assumed Employee, the "Actual Annual
Bonus Amount"), plus (2) the amount of the employer portion of any Taxes
associated with the payment of the Actual Annual Bonus Amount, if any. Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company to, refund all amounts payable to Seller
pursuant to this Section 7.6(b) promptly, and in any event within thirty (30)
days, following the Buyer's and the Company's payment of the Actual Annual
Bonus Amounts for all of the Assumed Employees listed on Schedule 1.1(a)(ii);
provided, that in no event shall such payments be made later than March 31,
2016. Any refund payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 7.6(b)
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Seller.

or advisable to permit consummation of the Transaction, including filing any
notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act
as promptly as practicable and in no event later than (i) five (5) Business
Days after the date hereof for filings required under the HSR Act (which shall

business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or

contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period; (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Antitrust Entity entering
an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

shall cooperate with Intermediate LLC and the Company in any reasonable manner
in connection with Intermediate LLC or the Company seeking or obtaining any
such consents, approvals and waivers and filing any such notices or

with respect to obtaining a consent, approval or waiver without the prior
written consent of the Buyer.

8.3. Fulfillment of Closing Conditions. At and prior to the Closing, each
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill, and shall
cooperate with each other to fulfill, as soon as practicable the conditions
specified in Article IX to the extent that the fulfillment of such conditions
is within its or his control. In connection with the foregoing, each Party
will (a) refrain from any actions that would cause it to be unable to deliver
the certificates required pursuant to Sections 9.2(e) or 9.3(c), (b) execute
and deliver the applicable agreements and other documents referred to in
Article IX, (c) comply with all applicable Laws in connection with its
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (d) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain in a
timely manner all necessary waivers, consents and approvals, and make any
notice or application filings, in each case as required under any Laws,
Contracts or otherwise, including any Required Consents, and (e) use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.4. Public Announcements. During the 12 months following the Closing Date,
none of Argotec Holdings, Seller, the Acquired Companies or Buyer, or any of
their respective Affiliates, shall issue any press releases or otherwise make
any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, without the approval of Buyer and Seller (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall allow Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance. For the avoidance of doubt, no communication or
disclosure shall be made by Argotec Holdings, Seller, the Acquired Companies
or Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates, to any third party or any
officer, director, advisor or employee (other than on a need to know basis)
unless and until the Cut Bait Time shall have been reached without termination
of this Agreement and a public announcement has been made by Buyer in respect
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.5. Tax Matters.

(j) Tax Returns for Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. Seller, at
its own expense, shall prepare or cause to be prepared (in a manner consistent
with prior practice) all income Tax Returns for Intermediate LLC, the Company
and the Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date.
Intermediate LLC, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall timely file such
income Tax Returns as so prepared.

(k) Tax Returns for Periods Beginning on or Before and Ending After the
Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed any income Tax Returns of Intermediate LLC, the Company and the
Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin on or before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date ("Straddle Periods"). Buyer shall permit Seller to
review and comment on such income Tax Returns prior to filing and shall not
file such Tax Returns without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of Section
11.2(a)(vii), the amount of Taxes attributable to the portion of a Straddle
Period through the end of the Closing Date, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are not based upon or related to income or
receipts or expenses, shall be deemed to be the amount of Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.
In the case of all Straddle Period Taxes not described in the preceding
sentence, the portion of the Taxes associated with the portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be apportioned
between the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
of the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of
days in each such period.

(l) Amended Tax Returns. Buyer shall not, nor shall it permit or cause any of
its Affiliates, Intermediate LLC, the Company, or any of the Subsidiaries to,
amend, file, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election
of Intermediate LLC, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to
Tax periods that begin prior to the Closing Date without consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(m) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller shall and shall cause their
Affiliates to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other, in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns (including the
completion of any IRS Forms 5471) and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include (i) the
retention and (upon the other's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any Tax Return, audit, litigation
or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder; (ii) assistance to the other party in preparing any Tax
Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in
accordance with this Section 8.5 and in connection therewith, providing the
other party with any necessary powers of attorney; and (iii) cooperating fully
in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes with Taxing
Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary.

(n) Transfer Taxes. All transfer (including real property transfer and equity
interest transfer), documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller
when due. All necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
such Taxes will be prepared and filed by the party required to file such Tax
Returns under applicable Law.

(o) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds (and interest, if any, thereon) or benefit of
crediting an overpayment or over-accrual of Taxes (and interest, if any,
thereon) that are received by or credited to Buyer, Intermediate LLC, the
Company, or any of the Subsidiaries, with respect to a taxable period or
portion of the Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be
for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid over to
Seller any such refund or benefit of crediting of an overpayment (and any
interest with respect thereto); provided that such refund or benefit of
crediting an overpayment is not reflected in and taken into account as a
Current Asset in the calculation of Working Capital. Such payment shall be
paid over to Seller within sixty (60) Business Days after receipt or benefit
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, all Tax refunds (and interest, if any,
thereon) or benefit of crediting an overpayment or over-accrual of Taxes (and
interest, if any, thereon) with respect to a taxable period or portion of the
Straddle Period that begins on or after the day after the Closing Date shall
be for the account of the Buyer, Intermediate LLC, the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries.

(p) Deductions. Buyer and Seller agree that payments made with respect to
Indebtedness of Intermediate LLC or the Company, Seller Transaction Expenses
and Transaction Bonus Amounts, to the extent such payments give rise to Tax
deductions, Tax Losses, and Tax credits or otherwise may offset taxable income
or Tax under applicable Law, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
be considered to arise in the taxable period of Seller that ends on December
31, 2015, and shall be claimed by Seller in such period, and provisions of
this Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent
therewith.

(q) No Closing Date Tax Actions. Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates (including
Intermediate LLC, the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing) shall
cause to be made any extraordinary transaction or event on the Closing Date
that could result in any increased Tax Liability for which Seller would be
responsible (through payment, indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, or
otherwise); provided, however, that Buyer, at its sole discretion, shall be
permitted to make elections under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to
Argotec Asia and Argotec GmbH.

(r) Tax Mitigation. The Parties agree to use reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Person or take such other actions as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could otherwise
be imposed with respect to a taxable period or portion of the Straddle Period
ending on or before the Closing Date.

(s) Responsibility for Post-Closing Taxes. Buyer shall be responsible for all
Taxes of Intermediate LLC, the Company and all Subsidiaries that are
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period that begins the day after
Closing, and all Tax periods that begin after the Closing.

8.6. Certain Restrictive Covenants. During the period from the date hereof
through the date that is three (3) years following the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), Seller, Argotec Holdings and each of the Persons
identified on Schedule 8.6 (each, a "Restricted Party" and together, the
"Restricted Parties") shall not, directly or indirectly, as agent, employee,
consultant, distributor, representative, stockholder, manager, partner or in
any other capacity:

(a) employ or engage, or recruit or solicit for employment or engagement (as a
consultant or otherwise) any management employee of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (provided that the solicitation or hiring of such employees (i)
through the use of general solicitations, including through media
advertisements, job boards or employment search firms in the ordinary course
of business that are not targeted at such employees, or (ii) if such employee
has ceased to be employed or retained by the Company or its Subsidiaries for
at least six (6) months prior to such solicitation or hiring, shall be deemed
not to violate the foregoing provisions); or

(b) make (or cause to be made) to any Person any disparaging or derogatory or
otherwise negative or false comments or statements concerning the Company, the
Subsidiaries or Buyer, or any of their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees, partners, shareholders or agents (or any of their
products or services or respective business reputation or personal
reputation).

The period of time during which the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.6
will be in effect will be extended for a given Restricted Party by the length
of time during which such Restricted Party is in breach of the terms of those
provisions as determined by any court of competent jurisdiction.

8.7. Restrictions on Competition and Interference. During the period from the
date hereof through the date that is four (4) years after the Closing Date,
none of the Restricted Parties shall, directly or indirectly, through any
Affiliate or any of their officers, directors, agents or otherwise:

(i) interfere or attempt to interfere with the relationship of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates with any
Specified Business Contact, or encourage, induce, attempt to induce, solicit
or attempt to solicit (on his, her or its own behalf or on behalf of any other
Person) any Specified Business Contact to terminate or adversely modify its
business relationship with the Company or its Subsidiaries; or

(j) in the Restricted Area, own, manage, engage in, operate, control, work
for, consult with, render services for, do business with, maintain any
interest in (proprietary, financial or otherwise) or participate in the
ownership, management, operation or control of, any business, whether in
corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, that engages in
the Business (a "Restricted Business"); provided, however, that the
restrictions contained in this Section 8.7 shall not restrict the acquisition
of less than 5% of the outstanding Equity Interests of any publicly traded
company engaged in a Restricted Business; provided further, however, that the
restrictions contained in this Section 8.7(b) shall not prohibit or limit any
Person listed on Schedule 8.6 who is employed by Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary following the Closing from performing his or her duties as an
employee of Buyer or the Acquired Companies. As used herein, "Restricted Area"
shall mean the entire world.

(k) For purposes of this Agreement, "Specified Business Contact" shall mean
any Person that has, or at any time during the twelve (12) month period prior
to the Closing had, a business relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or as to whom Seller, Argotec Holdings or a Person listed on
Schedule 8.6 obtains or obtained confidential information concerning the
business relationship or potential business relationship between such Person
and the Company, its Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates).

(l) The period of time during which the restrictions set forth in this Section
8.7 will be in effect will be extended for a given Restricted Party by the
length of time during which such Restricted Party is in breach of the terms of
those provisions as determined by any court of competent jurisdiction.

(m) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in
Sections 8.6 and 8.7 are reasonable (including as to scope, time and area),
not unduly restrictive of each applicable Restricted Party's rights, supported
by adequate consideration and necessary protection of the immediate interests
of Buyer, and any violation of these restrictions may cause immediate and
irreparable injury to Buyer for which there may be no adequate monetary
damages. In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions
contained in Sections 8.6 and 8.7 are essential elements of this Agreement and
that but for these restrictions, Buyer would not have agreed to enter into
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Restricted
Party agrees not to challenge the validity or importance of such restrictions.
If any court determines that any provision of Section 8.6 or 8.7 is
unenforceable, such court will have the power, and is hereby requested in such
event, to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be,
or terminate such provision until, in such reduced form, such provision shall
be enforceable. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing
restrictions shall not be terminated, unless so terminated by a court, but
shall be deemed amended to the extent required to render them valid and
enforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of
Sections 8.6 and 8.7 in the jurisdiction of the court that has made the
adjudication.

8.8. Exclusivity. During the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section

Equity Holders shall not, and shall direct their managers, officers,
employees, investment bankers and other Affiliates and representatives not to,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the initiation of any inquiry,
proposal, or offer concerning any acquisition (of assets or Equity Interests),
equity or debt financing, joint venture, merger, reorganization,
consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, liquidation,
dissolution, equity exchange, sale of Equity Interests, sale of assets or
similar business transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(a "Sale Transaction") or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any third party regarding, or furnish to any third party any information
in connection with, any Sale Transaction. If Seller, any Acquired Company,
Argotec Holdings or any Ultimate Equity Holder receives any offer, proposal or
inquiry with respect to a Sale Transaction, they shall promptly inform Buyer
of such offer, proposal or inquiry by written notice (such notice to include
all material details of such offer, proposal or inquiry).

8.9. Business Confidential Information. Seller, Argotec Holdings and each
Ultimate Equity Holder understands and acknowledges that such Person has had
access to and has learned (i) information proprietary to Intermediate LLC, the
Company and the Subsidiaries, including Intellectual Property and Technology,
policies and strategies, details of client and consultant contracts,
operations methods, product development techniques, business plans and all
other confidential information with respect to the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) other confidential or proprietary information of
Intermediate LLC, the Company and its Subsidiaries obtained by such Person
prior to the Closing, including the terms of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby, and (iii) other confidential or proprietary
information of Intermediate LLC, the Company, the Subsidiaries, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates obtained by such Person pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby (collectively, the

Confidential Information to any third party (including, in the case of the
Wind Point Equity Holders, any of their respective portfolio companies) or use
any Business Confidential Information in any way, in each case other than (in
the case of any Ultimate Equity Holder that is an Assumed Employee) for the
benefit of Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries in performance of such
Person's duties as an officer or employee of Buyer, the Company or a
Subsidiary. The restrictions contained in this Section 8.9 shall not apply to
any information which (x) is at the Closing Date or thereafter becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure,
directly or indirectly, by Seller, Argotec Holdings or any Ultimate Equity
Holder in violation of this Agreement or a breach by any other Person of any
legal or contractual obligation known to Seller, Argotec Holdings or any
Ultimate Equity Holder, (y) is required to be disclosed by applicable Law,
provided, that, in such event, Seller, Argotec Holdings or the applicable
Ultimate Equity Holder (as applicable) shall use reasonable efforts to give
reasonable advance notice of such requirement to Buyer to enable Buyer or any
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy with respect to such permitted disclosure, or (z) becomes

provided that such source is not known to Seller, Argotec Holdings or such
Ultimate Equity Holder (as applicable) to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

8.10. Related Party Accounts and Agreements. On or before the Closing Date,
the Acquired Companies shall: (a) cancel all loans or other accounts between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Related
Person, on the other hand; and (b) take all actions necessary to terminate all
rights and obligations under all Contracts (other than as to any restrictive
covenants contained therein which bind any current or former owners, officers
or employees of the Company or any Subsidiary), business relationships or
commitments between the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and any Related
Person, on the other hand (the "Related Party Agreements"). Following the
Closing Date, except with respect to any restrictive covenants assigned
pursuant to the Master Restrictive Covenant Assignment Agreement, neither the
Acquired Companies nor any of their Affiliates (including Buyer and its
Affiliates), on the one hand, nor any Seller or any other Related Person, on
the other hand, shall have any Liability to the other with respect to any
Related Party Agreement (other than any rights to indemnification contemplated
by Article XI).

the Closing Payment Amount, Seller, Argotec Holdings and each Ultimate Equity
Holder, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (collectively for purposes of
this Section 8.11, the "Releasing Parties") hereby consents to the

10.3. Remedies. Any Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1
shall have the right to recover damages sustained by such Party as a result of
any willful breach by the other Party of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or fraud or willful
misrepresentation; provided, however, that the Party seeking relief is not in
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement under circumstances which would have permitted the other Party
to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.1.

to which the Person to be indemnified shall have given notice to the
indemnifying party in accordance with Section 11.4(a) and (b) before the
applicable Expiration Date.



11.2. Indemnification by Seller.

(t) Subject to Sections 11.5 and 11.6 hereof, Seller shall, indemnify and hold
the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses
(without duplication), and pay to the applicable Buyer Indemnified Parties the
amount of, any and all Losses based upon, resulting from or in connection
with:

(i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Seller,
Intermediate LLC or the Company in Article III of this Agreement to be true
and correct in all respects at and as of the date hereof and at and as of the
Closing Date;

(ii) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Seller in
Article IV of this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects at and as
of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date;

(iii) the breach of any Pre-Closing Covenant on the part of Intermediate LLC
or the Company;

(iv) the breach of any covenant on the part of Seller;

(v) any failure to properly calculate the unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses,
the Transaction Bonus Amount, the Closing Indebtedness Payoff Amount or the
Closing Working Capital;

(vi) any fraud of Seller, Argotec Holdings or any Ultimate Equity Holder;

(vii) the non-payment of any Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through
the end of the Closing Date for any Straddle Period (computed in accordance
with Sections 8.5(b)); and

(viii) any breach or violation by any of the Acquired Companies of the Stevens
Consent Injunction occurring prior to the Closing.

(u) Buyer shall use and shall cause its Affiliates to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate and otherwise minimize any Loss to
the extent required by applicable Law upon and after becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses that may be
indemnifiable under this Section 11.2 (it being understood and agreed that any
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with
such mitigation shall themselves constitute Losses, to the extent the Losses
mitigated would have been indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 11.2).

11.3. Indemnification by Buyer.

(c) Subject to Sections 11.5 and 11.6 hereof, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against (without
duplication), and pay to the applicable Seller Indemnified Parties the amount
of, any and all Losses based upon, resulting from or in connection with:

(xv) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Buyer in
this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects at the date hereof and
at and as of the Closing Date;

(xvi) the breach of any covenant on the part of Buyer; and

(xvii) any breach on the part of Intermediate LLC, the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their successors or assigns of any covenant that by its
nature is to be performed after Closing.

(d) Seller shall use and shall cause its Affiliates to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate and otherwise minimize any Loss to
the extent required by applicable Law upon and after becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses that may be
indemnifiable under this Section 11.3 (it being understood and agreed that any
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with
such mitigation shall themselves constitute Losses, to the extent the Losses
mitigated would have been indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 11.3).

11.4. Indemnification Procedures.

(n) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party
claim may be asserted by notice to (i) Seller, in respect of a claim for which
indemnification is sought under Section 11.2(a), and (ii) Buyer, in respect of
a claim for which indemnification is sought under Section 11.3(a), in each
case prior to expiration of the applicable survival period for the provision
or obligation forming the basis thereof.

(o) In the event of any Indemnification Claim (including an audit with respect
to Taxes), the indemnified party subject to such claim shall promptly cause
written notice of the assertion of such Indemnification Claim of which it has
knowledge to be forwarded to (i) to Seller, in respect of an Indemnification
Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 11.2, and (ii) to Buyer,
in respect of an Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under
Section 11.3. The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt
notice of any such Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise
affect the indemnifying party's obligations with respect thereto except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result of such failure.
The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense,
to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified by it hereunder. The indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume control of an Indemnification Claim and the indemnifying party shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the indemnified
party if (A) the Indemnification Claim relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal proceeding, action, indictment or allegation, or (B) the
Indemnification Claim seeks injunctive or other equitable relief, or which, if
adversely determined, would impair in any material respect the financial
condition, business, operations, reputation or prospects of the indemnified
party. All expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the indemnified
party in connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the indemnifying
party. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against by it hereunder, it shall within thirty (30) days (or
sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the
indemnified party of its intent to do so and acknowledge in writing without
qualification its indemnification obligation. If the indemnifying party does
not elect to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim and its costs of doing so shall
constitute Losses for purposes of Section 11.2 or 11.3. If the indemnifying
party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the indemnified
party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such
Indemnification Claim; provided, however, that such Person shall be entitled
to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party (but subject to Section 11.5 and 11.6) if, (i) so requested
by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such
separate representation advisable; and provided, further, that the
indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
(plus any appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection
with any Indemnification Claim. The Parties hereto agree to cooperate fully
with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of
any such Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.4
to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party
shall, without the written consent of Seller or Buyer as applicable (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or
compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or consent to entry
of any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide to such other party
an unqualified release from all Liability in respect of the Indemnification
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money
damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying
party notifies the indemnified party in writing of such Person's willingness
to accept the settlement offer and issue a full release of both the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party and, subject to the applicable
limitations of Sections 11.5 and 11.6, pay the amount called for by such
offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the
indemnified party may continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of
any participation by the indemnifying party at its own expense, and the amount
of any ultimate Liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the
indemnifying party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the
lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that the indemnified party
declined to accept plus any other Losses of the indemnified party relating to
such Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement
offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to
such Indemnification Claim (but in any case, subject to Sections 11.5 and
11.6).

(p) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at an
agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder, the indemnified
party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing
by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such
matter.

(q) Following the determination of any applicable amount that Seller shall be
obligated to indemnify pursuant to Section 11.2(a), Seller and Buyer shall, to
the extent funds remain in the Escrow Account as of such time, promptly
execute a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to distribute to the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party such amount in
satisfaction of such obligations.

11.5. Certain Limitations on Indemnification.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XI, neither Seller nor
Buyer shall have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Section
11.2(a)(i), Section 11.2(a)(ii) or Section 11.3(a)(i), (i) for any individual
item, or group of items arising out of the same or series of similar facts,
conditions or events, where the aggregate amount of Losses relating thereto is
less than the Sub-Basket and where the aggregate amount of Losses relating
thereto is equal to or exceeds the Sub-Basket, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
or Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
indemnification for the full amount of such individual item (or group of items
as set forth above), subject to clause (ii) below, and (ii) unless the
aggregate amount of all Losses on a cumulative basis suffered by Buyer
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, exceeds
the Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess. In no event shall
the aggregate indemnification for which Seller is obligated under Section
11.2(a)(i) and Section 11.2(a)(ii) exceed the Cap, provided that the
limitations on indemnification set forth in this Section 11.5(a) shall not
apply to Losses based upon or resulting from the failure of any of the
Fundamental Representations of the Company or of Seller or the Specified
Representations to be true and correct in all respects at and as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be
liable, other than with respect to fraud, for any amount in excess of the
Purchase Price. Other than with respect to fraud, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties' first recourse for indemnification by Seller under Section 11.2(a)
shall be by application to the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, and thereafter, Buyer shall have recourse, at its sole
discretion, to Seller in an amount up to the Cap, provided that to the extent
that the Escrow Amount shall have first been exhausted, the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to (i) Losses based upon or resulting from the
failure of any of the Fundamental Representations of the Company or of Seller
or the Specified Representations to be true and correct in all respects as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing Date or (ii) claims for indemnification
under Sections 11.2(a)(iii) through (viii).

(f) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall make any claim for indemnification under
this Article XI in respect of any amount to extent that it is specifically
reflected in and taken into account as a Current Liability in the calculation
of Working Capital, including any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.6.

11.6. Calculation of Losses.

(h) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article XI shall (i) be net of any Tax benefits actually recognized as a cash
reduction in Taxes or by the indemnified party and amounts actually recovered
by the indemnified party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to
such Losses (net of any Tax or expenses incurred in connection with such
recovery), (ii) be net of any amounts recovered by the indemnified party from
Collateral Sources, (iii) take into account all increases in Taxes payable by
the indemnified party as a result of the receipt of the indemnity payment, and
(iv) to the extent not previously taken into account in computing the amount
of the Loss, all increases in Taxes payable by the indemnified party for all
affected taxable years and periods as a result of the event giving rise to
such Loss. If amounts are recovered from a Collateral Source after an
indemnifying party makes a payment to or on behalf of an Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article XI, the net proceeds thereof shall promptly be
remitted to the Indemnifying Party that made such payment. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that no right of subrogation to any rights of any party
hereunder shall accrue or inure to the benefit of any Collateral Source.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any punitive
damages of such other Person, except to the extent payable to a third party.

11.7. Materiality. The Parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that,
except for the representations set forth in Section 3.8(b), for the purpose of
determining the amount of the applicable Losses and for purposes of
determining whether a breach has occurred, qualifications as to materiality or
material adverse effect (or any similar qualification) in any representation,
warranty or covenant set forth herein or in any other document contemplated by
this Agreement shall be ignored.

11.8. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All payments made pursuant to
this Article XI shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

11.9. Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, other than with respect to
any fraud claim, the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any breach or
failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and
correct, of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement, shall be indemnification in accordance with this Article XI.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, other than with respect to any fraud
claim, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights
of contribution, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist
or may arise in the future, that it may have against Seller or Buyer, as the
case may be, arising under or based upon any Law to the extent arising out of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 11.9 shall not operate to interfere with or impede the operation of
the provisions of Article II concerning the (i) resolution of certain disputes
relating to the Purchase Price between the Parties and/or by a Settlement
Accountant and (ii) the rights of the parties to seek equitable remedies
(including specific performance or injunctive relief).

11.10. Guarantee of Seller Indemnification Obligations. The Ultimate Equity
Holders, severally but not jointly, in accordance with their respective
Ownership Percentages, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee to
Buyer, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, the full and timely
payment and performance of Seller's covenants and agreements in this Article
XI (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). This is a guarantee of
payment and performance, and not merely of collection, and each Ultimate
Equity Holder acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and
unconditional, and no amendment, modification, release or extinguishment of
Seller's obligations or liabilities, whether by decree in any bankruptcy
proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guarantee; provided, however, that a Delay of Payment
must have occurred before any Buyer Indemnified Parties may seek to enforce a
Guaranteed Obligation against any Ultimate Equity Holder. Seller and each
Ultimate Equity Holder hereby waive, for the benefit of Buyer, (a) any right
to require Buyer, as a condition of payment or performance by any Ultimate
Equity Holder, to proceed in any Legal Proceeding against Seller or pursue any
other remedies whatsoever after a Delay of Payment has occurred and (b) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived
from or afforded by any Law that limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, other than defense of payment and performance in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each of the Ultimate Equity Holders understands
that Buyer is relying on this guarantee in entering into this Agreement. Each
Ultimate Equity Holder hereby represents and warrants, on behalf of itself,
himself or herself only, that (i) it, he or she has all requisite power and
authority or capacity to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and (ii)
this Agreement represents (assuming the valid authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Buyer) the legal, valid and binding obligation
of such Ultimate Equity Holder, enforceable against such Ultimate Equity
Holder in accordance with its terms. The foregoing representations and
warranties of the Ultimate Equity Holders shall survive until the expiration
of Seller's obligations pursuant to Article XI.

12.9. Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents and the documents,

the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms.

12.10. Captions. All captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

12.11. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid or

provision in any other jurisdiction.

12.12. Specific Performance. Each of the Parties agrees that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof and that each
Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. In furtherance of and without
limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, (a) prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, each of Seller and
Buyer shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches of, or enforce compliance with, those covenants of Buyer that require
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or Seller that
require Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, as the case
may be, and (b) from and after the Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of, or enforce compliance with,
those covenants of Seller, Argotec Holdings and the Ultimate Equity Holders
set forth in Article VIII that contemplate performance after the Closing.

12.13. Conflicts and Privilege. Buyer agrees that, notwithstanding any current
or prior representation of Intermediate LLC, the Company and the Subsidiaries
by Pepper Hamilton LLP ("Pepper"), Pepper shall be allowed to represent Seller
or any of its Affiliates in any matters and disputes (or any other matter),
including in any matter or dispute adverse to Buyer, Intermediate LLC, the
Company or any Subsidiary that relates to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (a "Dispute") and Buyer hereby (a) waives any claim it has
or may have that Pepper has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited
from engaging in such representation and (b) agrees that, in the event that a
Dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, Intermediate LLC, the Company
or any Subsidiary and Seller or any of its Affiliates, Pepper may represent
Seller or any of its Affiliates in such Dispute even though the interests of
Seller or its Affiliate may be directly adverse to Buyer, Intermediate LLC,
the Company or the Subsidiaries and even though Pepper may have represented
Intermediate LLC, the Company or the Subsidiaries in a matter substantially
related to such Dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company or
the Subsidiaries; provided, however, that that no such representation shall be
a waiver of any attorney-client privilege between Intermediate LLC, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Pepper, on the other
hand, and Seller shall cause Pepper acting as its counsel to not take any
actions or engage in any representation that would affect or be deemed to be
such a waiver. Following the Closing, Buyer agrees that it will not (i)
request from Pepper or Seller or (ii) use or intentionally access any of the
communications among Pepper, Intermediate LLC, the Company or any Subsidiary,
and/or Seller relating to the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Communications") in connection with any Dispute or potential Dispute;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer from
requesting, using or accessing any Communications in connection with document
production requests or discovery in any Legal Proceeding so long as such
Communications would not be subject to an attorney-client privilege if they
were being requested in a Legal Proceeding by an unrelated third party and
such Communications are produced or required to be produced in response to
such document production requests or discovery. Following the Closing, Seller
shall be permitted to use the Communications in connection with the defense of
any Dispute with Buyer, Intermediate LLC, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, that such use does not waive any applicable privileges
or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of any
Communications to any third party. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 12.13 or in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
applicable privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent
disclosure of any Communications to any third party, and Seller shall not take
any action, or cause Pepper to take any action, that would reasonably be
expected to waive any such privilege or protection as to any third party.

12.14. Interpretation.

(a) The meaning assigned to each term defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term and vice
versa, and words denoting either gender shall include both genders as the
context requires. Where a word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other
grammatical forms shall have a corresponding meaning.

(b) The terms "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import

or Schedule, such reference is to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule to
this Agreement as amended unless otherwise specified.

(f) Reference to any Law means such Law as amended, modified, codified,
replaced or reenacted, and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(g) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. Any rule of construction or interpretation otherwise requiring
this Agreement to be construed or interpreted against any Party by virtue of
the authorship of this Agreement shall not apply to the construction and
interpretation hereof.

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Buyer, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or any of the
Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Closing Date, and nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give the Company or Seller, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct Buyer's or its subsidiaries'
operations. Prior to the Closing Date, each of Buyer and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries' respective operations.

(i) Except to the extent a shorter time period is expressly set forth herein
for a particular cause of action, Actions hereunder may be brought at any time
prior to the expiration of the longest time period permitted by Section
8106(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any cause of action for
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall
accrue, and the statute of limitations period shall begin to run, upon
discovery of such breach by the Party seeking to assert such cause of action.

12.15. Further Assurances. After the Closing, from time to time, as and when
requested by any Party, each Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other reasonable actions, as such other
Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, in the case of Seller,
executing and delivering to Buyer such assignments, deeds, bills of sale,
consents and other instruments as Buyer or its counsel may reasonably request
as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

12.16. Parent Guarantee. Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees to Seller, as primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the full
and timely payment and performance of Buyer's covenants and agreements in this
Agreement (collectively, the "Buyer Guaranteed Obligations"). This is a
guarantee of payment and performance, and not merely of collection, and Parent
acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no
amendment, modification, release or extinguishment of Buyer's obligations or
liabilities, whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise,
shall affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee;
provided, however, that a Delay of Payment must have occurred before any
Seller Indemnified Parties may seek to enforce a Buyer Guaranteed Obligation
against Parent. Parent hereby waives, for the benefit of Seller, (a) any right
to require Buyer, as a condition of payment or performance by Parent, to
proceed in any Legal Proceeding against Buyer or pursue any other remedies
whatsoever after a Delay of Payment has occurred and (b) to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or
afforded by any Law that limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or
sureties, other than defense of payment and performance in full of the Buyer
Guaranteed Obligations. Parent understands that Seller is relying on this
guarantee in entering into this Agreement. Parent hereby represents and
warrants that (i) it has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement represents (assuming the
valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other
parties hereto) the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable
against Parent in accordance with its terms. The foregoing representations and
warranties of Parent shall survive until the Buyer Guaranteed Obligations have
been performed or paid and satisfied in full.
