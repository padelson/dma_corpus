additional information and assistance as Merger Sub may reasonably request for
purposes of communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial
holders of Company Common Stock. All information furnished in accordance with
this _Section 2.3(c)_ shall be held in confidence by Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
March 21, 2016, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and shall be used by Parent and Merger Sub only in connection
with the communication of the Offer and the Merger to the holders of Company
Common Stock, and, if this Agreement is terminated or the Offer is otherwise
terminated, Parent or Merger Sub shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
at Parents election, either deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Company
or destroy all copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in
their possession or in the possession of their Representatives. The Company
shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to register) the
transfer of Company Shares accepted for payment effective immediately after
the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , that Merger Sub pays for such Company
Shares at or immediately after such transfer.

2.4 _Board of Directors_. Subject to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall be
entitled to designate a number of directors, rounded to the nearest whole
number, constituting a majority of directors on the Company Board as of the
Acceptance Time, and the Company and the Company Board shall promptly take
all actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed
to the Company Board as of the Acceptance Time, including increasing the size
of the Company Board to create vacancies and/or seeking and accepting
resignations of incumbent directors. The Companys obligations to appoint
Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and the Company shall
take any action required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder (subject to the Companys receipt of the information
with respect to Parent and its nominees, officers, directors and
Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder). The provisions of this Section 2.4 are in addition to, and shall
not limit, any right that Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent or
Merger Sub may have (with respect to the election of directors or otherwise)
under applicable Law as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company
Common Stock.

3.6 _Effect on Stock_. At the Merger Effective Time, as a result of and by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger
Sub:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than (i) Company Shares
that are owned by the Company as treasury shares and Company Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or the
Company (such Company Shares, " _Excluded Shares_ "), and (ii) Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with this
_Article III_ , an amount equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_.

 

(i) Each Company Share converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.6(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each share of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (the " _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") (other than Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares
or Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon transfer of such Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with this _Article III_.

 

(ii) Each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding
and shall be automatically canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time shall be converted into one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. If, from the Acceptance Time until the
Merger Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted, without
duplication, to provide the holders of Company Common Stock

 



20  the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ , that no such adjustment shall result in any increase or
decrease of the aggregate Merger Consideration. Nothing in this _Section
3.6(d)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any
such change that it is not otherwise specifically authorized or permitted to
be taken pursuant to this Agreement.

 

3.7 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, any holder of any Company Common Stock or
Restricted Stock Units or any other Person, each Restricted Stock Unit that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be fully vested and become free of
all vesting restrictions immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, retired
and cease to exist and be converted into the right to receive (without
duplication) an amount in cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of
Company Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Unit. As of the Merger
Effective Time, each holder of a Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except pursuant to this _Section 3.7(a)_. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash payable with respect to any
Restricted Stock Units. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.7(a)_.

any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, any holder of any Company Common Stock or PSUs or any
other Person, each PSU that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be fully vested
and become free of all vesting restrictions immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time and shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled, retired and cease to exist and be converted into the right to
receive (without duplication) an amount in cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by
(ii) the number of Company Shares subject to such PSU (with respect to PSUs
that are in their performance period as of the Merger Effective Time,
determined in accordance with the existing award agreement related to each
outstanding PSU). As of the Merger Effective Time, each holder of a PSU shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except pursuant to this
_Section 3.7(b)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash payable
with respect to any PSUs. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to effectuate this  _Section 3.7(b)_.

(c) _Company Options_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, any holder of any Company Options or any
other Person, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be fully vested and
become free of all vesting restrictions immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time and shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled, retired and shall cease to exist and be converted into the right to
receive (without duplication), an amount in cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of

 



21  (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Company Share
subject to such Company Option, and (ii) the number of Company Shares
underlying such Company Option. To the extent that the exercise price per
Company Share of a Company Option is equal to or higher than the Merger
Consideration, then such Company Option shall be terminated immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time and the holder thereof shall be entitled to no
consideration in connection with such cancellation. As of the Merger Effective
Time, each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except pursuant to this _Section 3.7(c)_. No interest shall
be paid or accrued on any cash payable with respect to any Company Option.
Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.7(c)_.

 

(d) _Phantom Units_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, any holder of any Company Common Stock or Phantom
Units or any other Person, each Phantom Unit that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) shall be fully vested and become free of all vesting restrictions
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, retired and cease to exist
and be converted into the right to receive (without duplication) an amount in
cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of Company Shares subject to such
Phantom Unit. As of the Merger Effective Time, each holder of a Phantom Unit
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to
receive the cash payments described in this _Section 3.7(d)_. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any cash payable with respect to any Phantom
Unit. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.7(d)_.

 

(e) Unless a later time for payment is otherwise agreed between Parent and an
individual holder, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company
Options, PSUs and Restricted Stock Units the cash payments described in this
_Section 3.7_ promptly after the Merger Effective Time, but in any event not
later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Merger Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash payments described in this _Section
3.7_ shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(f) _Company Actions_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Merger Effective Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company
Board, as applicable, (x) shall adopt any resolutions and amendments and (y)
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents or waivers (if any)
from the holders of any Company Options, PSUs, Phantom Units and/or Restricted
Stock Units, that may be necessary (or reasonably requested by Parent) to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.7_, in each case, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and shall take all such
other actions, without incurring any liabilities in connection therewith, as
Parent may reasonably deem to be necessary or required to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.7_. The Company shall take all
steps necessary to provide that the Company Equity Plans (as well as any
outstanding awards under any such plans) shall be terminated effective as of
the Closing and to ensure that from and after the Merger Effective Time
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any
Person pursuant

 



22  to or in settlement of Company Options, PSUs, Phantom Units or Restricted
Stock Units after the Merger Effective Time.

 

3.8 _Exchange of Company Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_.

(i) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or promptly
following the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent, separate and apart from its other funds, for the benefit of holders of
Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration which such holders are entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_
"). The Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for all fees and expenses
of the Paying Agent.

 

(ii) The Merger Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii)
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest or
(iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from
either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of
The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination thereof, as directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to the holders of Company Common Stock following completion
of the Merger pursuant to this _Article III_ , and Parent shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that the Merger Fund includes at all times
following the Merger Effective Time cash sufficient to satisfy Parents then-
remaining obligation under this _Article III_. Any and all interest and other
income earned on the Merger Fund shall promptly be paid to Parent or as Parent
otherwise directs.

 

(iii) As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days following the Merger Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make
available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form approved by Parent and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon transfer of such Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for effecting the transfer of the
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(iv) Upon (A) delivery to the Paying Agent of a letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions and
(B) compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent
for delivery of Book-Entry Shares, each holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the aggregate Merger
Consideration in respect thereof in the form of a check to be mailed within
three (3) Business Days of receipt by the Paying Agent of such Book-Entry
Shares, and the Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due transfer
of the Book-Entry Shares. The Paying Agent shall

 



23  accept such Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of such Company Common Stock upon their
surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

(b) _Book Entry Holder_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a person other than the person in whose name the applicable Book-
Entry Share so transferred is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration thereof that the surrendered Book-Entry Share shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such
registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such
Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(c)  _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ upon conversion of any Company
Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Merger Effective Time that may have been
declared or made by the Company on such Company Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Merger Effective Time, and after the Merger Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time.

 

(d) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months
after the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as
general unsecured creditors with respect to the applicable Merger
Consideration and subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws
for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Merger Fund delivered to a public official to the extent
required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Company Common Stock (or with respect to all amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 3.7_) pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or under any other provision of
applicable federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. Prior to the Closing,
Parent shall consult with the Company regarding

 



24  withholding obligations related to non-U.S. employees in order to minimize
such withholding obligations. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holders of Company Shares (or to the recipient of any amount
payable pursuant to _Section 3.7_) in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent.

3.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Company Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand, and
who properly demands, appraisal of such Company Common Stock pursuant to, and
who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.6(a)_, but rather, the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(and, at the Merger Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Merger
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in
_Section 3.6(a)_. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of
any Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Merger Effective Time, except as required by applicable Law, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in
accordance with the DGCL or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

3.10 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the Merger
Effective Time, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent reasonably
believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its
right, title or interest in, to or under any of the property, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of either of the Company or
Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to consummate the Merger
or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the
Merger Effective Time, then the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective officers and directors shall, and shall be authorized to,
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

 



25 ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as (i) set forth in any Company SEC Document filed or furnished on or
after January 1, 2016 (including the exhibits and other information
incorporated by reference therein) and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement (but excluding any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any
"risk factors" section, any disclosures in any "forward-looking statements"
section and any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are
predictive or forward-looking in nature), it being understood that this clause
(i) shall not be applicable to _Section 4.1_,  _Section 4.2_, _Section
4.3_, _Section 4.4_, _Section 4.5_, _Section 4.26_, _Section 4.27_ and
_Section 4.28_, or (ii) set forth in writing in the applicable section of
the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ "), or in another section of the Company Disclosure Letter to the
extent that it is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such section, the Company represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

4.1 _Organization; Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and, where relevant, in good standing under the
Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted.
Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is qualified to do business
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the
concept of good standing) as a foreign corporation or other entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified, or, where relevant, in good standing,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent, prior to the date of this Agreement, a complete and
accurate copy of the Company Governing Documents as amended to the date
hereof. The Company Governing Documents are in full force and effect and the
Company is not in violation of any provision of either of the Company
Governing Documents. The Company has made available to Parent materially
complete and accurate copies the certificates of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each of the Companys
"significant subsidiaries" (as defined in Regulation S-X promulgated under the
Securities Act), each as currently in effect.

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity ownership interests, options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,
profit participation rights, contingent value rights, restricted stock units,
stock-based performance units or similar interests or rights in, each Company
Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and
are wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens. _Section 4.1(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and correct structure chart
showing each Company Subsidiary (including its direct and indirect owners and

 



26  jurisdiction of organization or formation) and each Person in which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary owns an equity interest.

 

4.2 _Capitalization of the Company_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 107,000,000
Company Shares and 5,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock. At the close
of business on June 3, 2016 (the " _Company Capitalization Date_ "), (i)(A)
29,292,877 Company Shares were issued and 29,292,528 Company Shares were
outstanding, (B) 349 Company Shares were held in treasury, (C) no Company

for 2,035,709 Company Shares were outstanding, (E) Restricted Stock Units
covering 435,565 Company Shares were outstanding, (F) PSUs covering up

issuance upon the exercise and subsequent conversion of outstanding BCE
Warrants, (ii) 2,249,223 Company Shares were reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Company Equity Plans and (iii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock
were issued or outstanding. All of the outstanding Company Shares are, and all
Company Shares reserved for issuance as noted above shall be, when issued in
accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and free of pre-emptive rights. Since the
Company Capitalization Date and through the date of this Agreement, the
Company has not issued any securities (including derivative securities) except
for any Company Shares issued upon any exercise or conversion of Company
Equity Awards, in each case, outstanding prior to such date and disclosed in
this _Section 4.2(a)_.

(b) _Section 4.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list, as of the close of business on the Company Capitalization Date,
(i) each Company Equity Award, (ii) the name of the Company Equity Award
holder, (iii) the number of Company Shares underlying each Company Equity
Award (including, with respect to each PSU, the target and maximum number of
Company Shares underlying such PSU), (iv) the date on which the Company Equity
Award was granted, (v) the Company Equity Plan under which the Company Equity
Award was granted, (vi) the number of Company Shares underlying each Company
Equity Award that are vested and unvested as of the Company Capitalization
Date, (vii) the exercise price of each Company Equity Award, if applicable,
and (viii) the expiration date of each Company Equity Award, if applicable.
All of the Company Options, PSUs, Phantom Units and Restricted Stock Units
have been granted to service providers of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (or any predecessor company) pursuant to the Company
Equity Plans. Each Company Equity Award was granted in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions
of the Company Equity Plan under which it was granted. Each Company Option
(A) has a grant date identical to (or after) the date on which the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) actually awarded such
Company Option, (B) qualifies for the tax and accounting treatment afforded
to such Company Option in the Tax Returns of the Company and the Company SEC
Documents, respectively, (C) was granted with an exercise price per Company
Share that was not less than the fair market value of a Company Share on the

written notice from the FDA or any other Governmental Authority (A)
contesting the premarket clearance or approval of, the uses of or the labeling
and promotion of any products of the Company or (B) otherwise alleging any

the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any violation of any
Regulatory Law or other Law (including rules and regulations promulgated by
the FDA) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in their product development
efforts, submissions, record keeping and reports to FDA that could reasonably
be expected to require or lead to investigation, corrective action or
enforcement, regulatory or administrative Action that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company

that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the various limitations,

representations and warranties in the first sentence of  _Section 5.9_, the
Company and the Company Board have taken all action necessary to exempt this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions from the

share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover laws
enacted under U.S. state or federal Laws apply to this Agreement or any of the

(B) the Company Board determines in good faith that, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such Alternative

Superior Proposal, and (C) the Company has given Parent prior written notice
of its intention to take any of the following actions and of the identity of
the Person or group making such Alternative Transaction Proposal and (y) it

disclosure obligations to Parent pursuant to this Agreement, and (B)

to lead to, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, the Company shall provide
Parent with oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity

Representatives, on the other hand. The Company shall provide Parent with
seventy-two (72) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is
provided to the members of the Company Board) of any meeting of the
Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider
any Alternative Transaction Proposal. Any material amendment (including the
form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) to any Alternative
Transaction Proposal will be deemed to be a new Alternative Transaction
Proposal for the purposes of this _Section 6.2_.

thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withhold, withdraw or qualify
(or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), publicly propose to

proposed transaction agreements with the Person or group making such Superior
Proposal and other material documents (the " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal

to constitute a Superior Proposal;

 

(iv) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation

fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(v) the Company shall have complied with _Section 6.2(a)_ and shall not

Change (it being understood and agreed that any material development in an
Intervening Event shall require a new notice and a new three (3) Business Day
period) and (B) prior to making such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
to the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement so as to obviate the need to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change on the basis of such Intervening Event so that
the Transactions may be effected;

(v) the Company shall not have breached any of the other provisions set forth

effect, or disclose pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position which
constitutes, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless specifically
permitted pursuant to the terms of _Section 6.2(d)_; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any disclosure other than (i) a "stop-look-and listen" communication to
the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the Company Stockholders), (ii)

practicable, a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to the requirements

case as may be restricted by applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose
any information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company on advice of
outside counsel, would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege with
respect to such information or which would constitute a waiver of any other
privilege or trade secret protection held by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; _provided_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts (x) to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or waiver of any other privilege
or trade secret protection or (y) to develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company. The Company shall advise Parent in such circumstances
that it is unable to comply with Parents requests for information pursuant
to the first sentence of this _Section 6.4(a)_ and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to generally describe the types of information
being withheld. The Company shall be entitled to have representatives present
at all times during any such inspection, and no notice, access, review or
investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ or information provided, made
available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this  _Section 6.4_ or
otherwise shall affect any representations or warranties of the Company or
conditions or rights of Parent contained in this Agreement. No investigation
after the date hereof shall affect or be deemed to modify or supplement any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein.

(b) _Confidentiality_. All information and materials provided pursuant to
this Agreement will be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the

terminated as of the Closing.

consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) preparing and
filing as soon as practicable after the date hereof all forms, registrations
and notices required to be filed to consummate the Transactions and taking
such actions as are reasonably necessary to obtain any requisite approvals,
consents, Orders, exemptions or waivers by any Governmental Authority or other
third party, including filings pursuant to the HSR Act with the United States
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (and the preparation and filing, as soon as reasonably
practicable, of any form or report required by any other Governmental
Authority relating to antitrust, competition, trade, pre-merger notification
or other regulatory matters), other applicable Antitrust Laws, and with the
NYSE or NASDAQ, (ii)

 



65  obtaining all necessary consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers from
third parties and providing any further information as may be required by such
third parties, (iii) defending any Actions challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, including
seeking to have vacated or reversed any Order that would restrain, prevent or
delay the Closing and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Each
of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. In addition, each of the parties
hereto shall consult with the other with respect to, provide any necessary
information with respect to and provide the other (or its counsel) copies of,
all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority or any other
information supplied by such party to a Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions.

(b) _Antitrust Filings_. Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.5(a)_,
each of the parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to file or cause to be filed, as promptly as practicable (but in

to the HSR Act), all required filings under the HSR Act and all required
filings under other applicable Antitrust Laws that Parent reasonably
determines in good faith to be necessary or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to obtain
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and other
applicable Antitrust Laws. The parties shall consult and cooperate with each
other in the preparation of such filings, and shall promptly inform the other
parties of any material communication received by such party from any
Antitrust Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company shall not agree to any voluntary extension of any statutory
deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of
the Transactions at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the
written consent of Parent.

communications, advise the other orally of) any communications from or with
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions, (iii) to the extent practical, not participate in any meeting
with any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
the other Transactions unless it consults with the other in advance, and (iv)
furnish the other with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the Company or Parent, as applicable, may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any
such Governmental Authority.

(d)  _Objections_. In furtherance of the covenants set forth in _Section
6.5(a)_, if any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under
any Antitrust Law or if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission, the

 



66  Department of Justice or any other applicable Governmental Authority
challenging any of the Transactions or which would otherwise prohibit,
materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
the Company shall take all actions necessary to resolve any such objections or
Actions (or threatened Actions) so as to permit consummation of the
Transactions to close as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided_ ,
that (i) the Company shall not propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, transfer,
license, divestiture or other disposition of, or any prohibition or limitation
on the ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of
ownership of, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any
of its Affiliates or of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries ("
_Divestitures_ ") without the prior written consent of Parent and (ii) the
obligations of the Company under this _Section 6.5(d)_ shall be conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parents and
Merger Subs obligations under this _Section 6.5(d)_ to use commercially
reasonable efforts shall not include (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to
or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, any
Divestiture, and (B) defending any judicial or administrative action or
similar proceeding instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any Person
under any Antitrust Law or seeking to have any stay, restraining order,
injunction or similar order entered by any Governmental Authority vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned.

(e) _Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of
NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the Company and of Company Common Stock from
NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time and the
deregistration of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting.

6.6 _State Takeover Statutes_. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, (a) the Company shall take all reasonable action necessary to
ensure that no "fair price," "business combination," "control share
acquisition" or other state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any of the Transactions and (b) if any "fair
price," "business combination," "control share acquisition" or other state
takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, the Company and the Company Board shall take all action
necessary, including granting such approvals, to ensure that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or
provided for, in this Agreement and otherwise to render inapplicable (or, if
not possible, minimize the effect of) such Law on the Merger and the other
Transactions.

6.7  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnification_. For a period of six (6) years following the Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any
and all indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any of their
respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes
a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the
Merger Effective Time (the

 



67  " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6) years
following the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, as the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time.

 

(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years following the Merger Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the current policies
(whether through purchase of a "tail" policy or otherwise) of directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") maintained
by the Company, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Merger Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (a true, correct and complete
copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect
to the coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of
the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
no less advantageous in the aggregate to former officers and directors of the
Company; and _provided_ , _further_ that if the aggregate annual premiums for
such policies at any time during such period will exceed 300% of the per year
premium rate paid by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof for such policies, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall only
be required to provide such coverage as will then be available at an annual
premium equal to 300% of such rate.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party
notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Merger Effective Time that an Action (whether arising before, at or after the
Merger Effective Time) has been commenced against such Indemnified Party in
respect of which such Person would be entitled to and expects to seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.7_, the provisions of this
_Section 6.7_ shall continue in effect with respect to such Action until the
final disposition of such Action.

(d) _Successors_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with, or merge
with or into, any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in
each case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall take such action as may
be necessary so that such Person shall assume the obligations of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

(e) _Enforceability_. Each of the directors and officers or other persons who
are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_ with full rights of enforcement as if a
party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who
are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
paragraph (b) above (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section
6.7_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
that such persons may have

 



68  under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity).

6.8 _Public Announcements_.

 

(a) The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press
release of the Company and Parent. Thereafter, the Company and Parent each
shall consult with each other prior to issuing, and will provide each other
the opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, and use reasonable
best efforts to agree on, any press releases or other public announcements or
any filings with any Governmental Authority or other third party with respect
to the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, except as either party,
after consultation with outside counsel, may determine is required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market or by the
request of any Governmental Authority if it has used reasonable best efforts
to consult with the other party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and
content of any such press release or public statement. In addition, neither
party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or
disclosure concerning the other party or the other partys
business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of
such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

(b) Prior to making any general, broad-based written or oral communications to
the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
Transactions, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended
communication, (ii) Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review
and comment on the communication, and (iii) Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that the employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries at the Merger Effective Time who continue to remain
employed with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") will, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
continuing through December 31, 2016, be provided with (i) base salary or wage
rate and annual cash bonus opportunities the same as are provided as of the
date hereof and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity compensation
benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
as of the date hereof.

 

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause any pre-
existing conditions and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any group plan of Parent or its Affiliates providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or other health benefits to be
waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents as
of the Closing Date and (ii) for any plan year in which the Merger Effective
Time occurs, to cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket
expenses paid by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof)
during the portion of the plan year in which such Continuing Employee
participated in the Company Benefit Plan to be taken into account for the
purposes of satisfying the 

 



69  corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable Parent benefit plan in the
applicable plan year. Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing
Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the extent
that it would not result in a duplication of benefits, to give each Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with the
Company as if such service had been performed with Parent to the extent that
such service was recognized under a similar Company Benefit Plan, in each
case, for all purposes, including, as applicable, vesting, eligibility
to participate, and level of benefits under the corresponding benefit plan
offered by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including vacation plans or
arrangements, defined contribution, and any severance and welfare plans;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this provisions shall not apply for purposes of
any frozen Parent benefit plan, any defined benefit pension plan, any retiree
medical or life plan, and any Parent benefit plan under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service under any equity incentive plan.

(c) Upon written request by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company
Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, (each a "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ ") effective not later than the day immediately
preceding the Merger Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that
such Company 401(k) Plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant
to resolution of the Company Board (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately
preceding the Merger Effective Time. In the event Parent provides the written
notice described in this _Section 6.9(c)_, Parent shall have in place a tax
qualified defined contribution retirement plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ")
in which Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in any
Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date (whether or not
actively participating) shall be immediately eligible to participate. The
Parent 401(k) Plan shall permit each such Continuing Employee with an account
balance in any Company 401(k) Plan to make rollover contributions, including
rollover of any outstanding loans held by participants.

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board or the appropriate committee of the Company Board shall take all
reasonable actions, including adopting any necessary resolutions, to (i) cause
any open offering period as of the date hereof under the Companys 2013
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") to be the final offering period
under the ESPP, such that no new offering period will commence under the ESPP
after such date and the current offering period underway shall be terminated
no later than the Business Day immediately prior to the anticipated Closing
Date (the " _Final Exercise Date_ "), (ii) treat such shortened offering
period as fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes
under the ESPP, (iii) prohibit participants in the ESPP from altering their
payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other
than to reduce the rate of payroll deductions or stop such payroll deductions
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP), (iv) provide that
each participants Company Share purchase rights under the ESPP be exercised
as of the Final Exercise Date and the amount of the accumulated contributions
of each participant under the ESPP as of immediately prior to the Final
Exercise Date shall, to the extent not used to purchase Company Shares in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP, be refunded to such
participant as promptly as practicable following the Final Exercise Date
(without interest), and (v) terminate the ESPP on the Final Exercise Date).

 



70 (e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended (i) to be treated as an amendment to
any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) to prevent Parent from amending or
terminating any of its benefit plans or, after the Merger Effective Time, any
Company Benefit Plan in accordance their terms, (iii) to prevent Parent, after
the Merger Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing
Employee, or (iv) to create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
individual other than the parties hereto including any employee of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or under any
benefit plan which Parent or the Company may maintain.

6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other party of (a) any notice or other communication
received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Merger Effective Time, alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (b) any
Action commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, that
purport to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions that make allegations that, if
true, would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be, and (c) (i) in the case of the Company, the
Knowledge of the Company of any breach of or inaccuracy in its representations
or warranties set forth herein or failure to perform its covenants or
agreements set forth herein to the extent such inaccuracy, breach or failure
to perform would give rise to the failure of any Offer Condition set forth in
_section (a)_ or _section (b)_ of _Annex I_ , or (ii) in the case of
Parent, the Knowledge of Parent of any breach of or inaccuracy in the
representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub set forth herein or
failure to perform the covenants or agreements of Parent and Merger Sub set
forth herein to the extent such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect any remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to
deliver such notice shall not, in and of itself, give rise to an incremental
breach for purposes of _Section 8.1_ or _section (a)_ or _section (b)_ of
_Annex I_ , separate and apart from the relevant underlying inaccuracy, breach
or failure to perform giving rise to the requirement to deliver the notice.

6.11 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any Action threatened or commenced after the date hereof
against the Company or any of its directors by any stockholder of the Company
relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions and
shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any such Action and shall consider
Parents views with respect to such Action and, and notwithstanding _Section
6.1(n)_, shall not settle any such Action without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



71 6.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including,
in each case, derivative securities) resulting from the Transactions by each
officer or director of the Company who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.13 _Section 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Company (acting through the Company Board or
the compensation committee of the Company Board) will take all such steps as
may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding that has
been or will be entered into by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with
any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which compensation,
severance or other benefits is paid to such officer, director or employee to
be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act and to otherwise satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

 

6.14 _BCE Warrants_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause each holder
of a BCE Warrant to exercise his or her BCE Warrant for all, and not less
than all, of the number of shares of Medicals capital stock issuable pursuant
to the terms of such BCE Warrant, and to immediately thereafter exchange all,
and not less than all, of such capital stock issued upon exercise of the BCE
Warrant for shares of Company Common Stock, in amounts and types calculated
pursuant to the terms of that certain Second Amended and Restated Put-Call
Agreement, dated August 6, 2013, by and among the Company, Medical, and the
parties listed on Schedule A and Schedule B thereto.

termination, the Company pays to the Parent the amounts contemplated by
_Section 8.3_.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in  _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and have no effect and the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate, except for the obligations set forth in the second
to the last sentence of  _Section 2.3(c)_, _Section 6.4(b)_, this _Section
8.2_ and _Section 8.3_, as well as _Article I_ and _Article IX_ to the extent
applicable to such surviving sections, each of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of
its willful and material

 



74  breach of any provision of this Agreement or from any rights, claims, causes
of action or remedies arising from fraud. No termination of this Agreement
shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms. In the event this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly, and in any event within one (1)
Business Day of such termination, terminate the Offer.

 

8.3 _Payments_.

(a)  _Company Termination Fee_. In the event that:

(i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_;

 

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ and prior
to such termination, an Alternative Transaction Proposal has been made and (B)
within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with any third party to consummate, or consummates, an
Alternative Transaction Proposal; or

(iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(g)_;

then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to Thirty-Four Million Two
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($34,200,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Any fee
due under this _Section 8.3(a)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day
funds to an account provided in writing by Parent to the Company (A) in the
case of termination pursuant to clauses (i) or (iii) above, on the date of
termination of this Agreement or (B) in the case of termination pursuant to
clause (ii) above, within two (2) Business Days of the date of the first to
occur of (x) the execution of a definitive agreement relating to an
Alternative Transaction Proposal and (y) consummation of a transaction
relating to an Alternative Transaction Proposal. The amounts payable pursuant
to this _Section 8.3_ constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. For
purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)_, the term " _Alternative Transaction
Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 1.1_,
except that all percentages therein shall be changed to "fifty percent
(50%)".

(b) _Interest and Costs_. Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and that,
without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would have entered
into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be
payable only once and not in duplication even though the Termination Fee may
be payable under one or more provisions hereof. Other than in the case of
a willful and material breach of this Agreement or fraud, in the event Parent
shall receive the Termination Fee, the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions (and the termination thereof or any matter forming the basis for
such termination), and in such case neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall be entitled to 

 



75  bring or maintain any other Action against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any
matters forming the basis for such termination. In the event that the Company
shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, and in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for such fee, then the Company shall pay to Parent its costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of
enforcement) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amounts owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published
in the Wall Street Journal, plus five percent (5%) per year, from the date
such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by such
party.

 

(c) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party
shall bear its own Expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, except that Parent shall pay any filing fees incurred in
connection with any filings pursuant to the HSR Act or to any non-U.S.
Antitrust Law. Furthermore, in the event that this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(e)_ due to a willful breach by the Company,
then the Company, in addition to any payments it may be required to make to
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ in respect of such termination, shall

9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of copies of
this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile, or electronic transmission
shall constitute

 



77 effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may
be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the
parties transmitted by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be deemed to
be their original signatures for all purposes.

 

9.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) (a)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement), among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
neither party is relying on any other oral or written representation,
agreement or understanding and (b) except for the provisions of _Section 6.7_
(which upon the Merger Effective Time are intended to benefit the Indemnified
Parties), and  _Section 3.6_ and _Section 3.7_ (which upon the Merger
Effective Time are intended to benefit the Company Stockholders and the
holders of Company Equity Awards, respectively) is not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

9.5 _Governing Law_. All disputes, claims or controversies (whether at law, in
contract in tort or otherwise) that may be based on, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of
this Agreement, or the Transactions shall be deemed made in and shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

9.6 _Amendments and Supplements_. This Agreement may be amended or
supplemented at any time by additional written agreements signed by, or on
behalf of the parties, as may mutually be determined by the parties to be
necessary, desirable or expedient to further the purpose of this Agreement or
to clarify the intention of the parties.

9.7 _Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or extended except
by a written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver or
extension is to be effective. No failure or delay on the part of any party
hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
of any other right.

 

9.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

9.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to

 



78  the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to
the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.
The rights and remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

9.10 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding  _Section 8.3_, the parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have
any adequate monetary remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed (or prohibited from being performed, as
applicable) in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, and the parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT AND MERGER SUB
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HERBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY, PARENT OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.11_. 

9.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, or to the extent such Court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, a Federal Court of the United Stated of America sitting in
Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") solely in respect of the interpretation
and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents
referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, and hereby waive, and agree not
to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or that
this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen
Courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims, actions,
suits and proceedings or other causes of action (whether at Law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Chosen
Courts. Each of the

 



79  parties agrees not to commence any action or proceeding except in the Chosen
Courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in the
manner provided in _Section 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted
by law shall be valid, effective and sufficient service thereof.

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

Merger Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment, and (subject to the
rules and regulations of the SEC) shall not be obligated to pay for, any
Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted
for payment or paid for) unless, prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it
may have been extended pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ of the Agreement), there
shall have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn Company Shares
that, considered together with all other Company Shares (if any) beneficially
owned by Parent and its Affiliates (excluding Company Shares tendered pursuant
to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received," as such
term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for the
Offer pursuant to such procedures), represent more than fifty percent (50%) of
the aggregate number of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
acceptance of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer.

The condition set forth in the above paragraph is referred to as the "
_Minimum Condition_ ".

 

Furthermore, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment, and
(subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC) shall not be obligated to
pay for, any Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not
theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) if, upon the expiration of the
Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ of
the Agreement) and before acceptance of such Company Shares for payment, any
of the following conditions exists and is continuing, regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to such condition:

 

(a) (i) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in
_Sections 4.1_, _4.3_ , _4.4_ , _4.9(a)_ ,  _4.26_ , _4.27_ and _4.28_ shall
fail to be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Acceptance Time as though made on and as of such date (except to
the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of
an earlier date, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct in all respects as of such earlier date), (ii) the representations
and warranties contained in _Section 4.2(a)_ and the first sentence of
_Section 4.2(b)_ shall fail to be true and correct in all respects as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time as though made on and as
of such date (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak
as of an earlier date, in which case, such representations and warranties
shall be true and correct in all respects as of such earlier date and except
for any inaccuracies that are _de minimis_ in both amount and nature), and
(iii) the other representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct (without giving effect to any
limitation on any representation or warranty indicated by the words
"Company Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects," "in any
material respect," "material," "materially" or words of similar import) as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time as though made on
and as of such date (except to the extent such representations and warranties
speak as of an earlier date, in which case, such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct in all respects as of such earlier date),
except in the case of clause (iii), where all failures of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct as of such dates have
not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



I-1 (b) The Company shall have failed to perform and comply with, in any material
respect, its obligations under the Agreement on or prior to the Acceptance
Time and such failure shall not have been cured on or prior to the Acceptance
Time;

 

(c) Since the date of the Agreement, there shall have been any event, change,
effect, development, condition or occurrence that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

(d) The Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed
by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company
and certifying as to the satisfaction by the Company of the applicable
conditions specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c) immediately above;

(e) A Law, Order, or other legal restraint or prohibition, entered, enacted,
promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction, shall be in effect, or be pending, which prohibits,
renders illegal or enjoins the consummation of the Transactions;

 

(f) Any waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to consummation
of the Merger under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated;
and

(g) The Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

The foregoing conditions (including the Minimum Condition) are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and, subject to applicable Law, may be
waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time in their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Condition), in each
case subject to the terms of the Agreement. Any reference in this _Annex I_ or
the Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed
to be satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived. The foregoing
conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The failure by Parent
or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meaning
as set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 6, 2016
(the " _Agreement_ "), by and among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.
