permitted by applicable Law (as hereinafter defined)) of the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to

conditions), or at such other place or at such other date or time as the
parties hereto may mutually agree.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by executing, delivering and filing a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and
other applicable Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective at such time
as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Parent
and the Company in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the DGCL (such time as the Merger becomes effective is
referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

(a) The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof, hereof and applicable Law, in each case consistent with
the obligations set forth in Section 5.9.

(b) The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be
the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof, hereof and applicable Law, in each
case consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 5.9.

Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger

resignation or removal.

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Closing Date shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective
Time, Parent may revise the structure of the Merger or otherwise revise the
method of effecting the Merger and related transactions, in any such case in
its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such revision shall



 

-2- (a) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration or alter or
change adversely the treatment of the holders of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Options, (b) alter or change ParentÂ’s or the CompanyÂ’s
obligations hereunder, or (c) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event Parent makes such
an election, Parent shall provide the Company with reasonable notice of such

Agreement in order to reflect such revision.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a)  _Parent Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(e)
and 2.1(f), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ", and each, a " _Share_
") together with the associated Rights (as defined herein), other than any
Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in Section 2.1(c))
and any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in Section
2.1(f)), shall thereupon be automatically converted into the right to receive
$48.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares,
together with the associated Rights, that have been converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(b) shall
be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Shares (and associated Rights) shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares and Rights other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

(c) _Cancelled Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, or held
by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of
third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
for such cancellation and retirement.

(d) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.



 

-3- (e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, or in the securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in
this Section 2.1(e) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

(f) _Dissenters Â’ Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the applicable provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to payment for such shares in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such holderÂ’s shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with Section 2.1(b), without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or
offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank, trust company or registrar
and transfer agent that shall be appointed by Parent and approved in advance
by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to act as a
exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") immediately available
funds equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ ")
and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.



 

-4- (b) _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares
(together with associated Rights) were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares ("
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and
shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as
specified by Parent and the Exchange Agent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
and (B) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) or non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in
exchange for the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares.

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss and customary security bonds, to the extent
required by ParentÂ’s then-current policies, in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of
Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective
Time (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) the Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
its Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this ARTICLE II.

(iii) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of U.S. state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined), such withheld or deducted
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made.

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
the Company, the proper amount of cash shall be paid to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.



 

-5- (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand,
and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in
accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund in cash, cash equivalents and investment funds
investing primarily in government securities as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided, however,_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
this ARTICLE II. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section
2.2(d).

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of an
indemnity agreement with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

Section 2.3 _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares and Deferred Equity Units; ASPP_. Except for Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Shares (each, as defined below) as to which the
treatment in the Merger has been or is hereafter separately agreed by Parent
and the holder thereof, which Company Stock Options and Company Restricted
Shares shall be treated as so agreed:

(a)(i) With respect to the holders of any outstanding options to purchase
Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") under the Company Stock Plans who
are Key Employees, at the Effective Time, each then unvested Company Stock
Option held by such Key Employee, shall be converted into an option to
acquire a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of Shares subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and



 

-6- (y) the Conversion Number, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Share of such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the
Conversion Number; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Company
Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any
Company Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise
price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to
such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following
the Effective Time, each converted Company Stock Option shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. " _Conversion
Number_ " means the quotient of (1) $48.00 and (2) the average, rounded to the
nearest tenth of a cent, of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on
the Nasdaq Stock Market as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five
full trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date of the
Effective Time.

(ii) Except as specifically provided above, any other Company Stock Option,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully
vested (based on a deemed achievement of performance awards at the maximum
level) and, subject to the terms of the Company Stock Plans, be converted into
the right to receive a payment in cash, payable in U.S. dollars and without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option shall not
theretofore have been exercised, whether or not then vested or exercisable.
The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the
cash payments described in this Section 2.3(a) on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within three (3) Business
Days following the Closing Date.

 

(b)(i) With respect to the holders of any award of restricted or performance
restricted Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") who
are Key Employees, each Company Restricted Share held by such Key Employee
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into restricted shares of Parent Common Stock determined by
multiplying the number of Company Restricted Shares by the Conversion Number.
Such restricted shares of Parent Common Stock shall be subject to the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Restricted Share.
The Company shall take all necessary actions to ensure that, from and after
the Effective Time, the Parent (or its assignee) shall be entitled to exercise
any repurchase option, vesting schedule or other rights set forth in the
restricted stock agreements, vesting schedules or any other agreement. (ii)
Except as expressly provided above, any other award of Company Restricted
Shares and any accrued stock dividends shall vest in full (based on a deemed
achievement of performance awards at the maximum level) and be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b).
The Surviving Corporation will vest and pay all cash dividends accrued but
unpaid on such Company Restricted Shares to the holders thereof within
three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time.



 

-7- (c) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 to any holder of
Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares such amounts as the
Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings
with and payments to Tax authorities relating to any such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock
Options or Company Restricted Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

(d) No later than seven days prior to the Effective Time, the then-current
Offering Period (as defined in the CompanyÂ’s Associate Stock Purchase Plan

the Company to Parent contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement

respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate, partnership or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted, except when the failure to have

Company Material Adverse Effect. True, complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") and
the by-laws of the Company (the " _Company By-laws_ "), as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, were made available to Parent prior to the date of
this Agreement and the Company Charter and Company By-laws are in effect in
such form.

(b) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the date of
this Agreement, the Company has made available to Parent a correct and
complete list of each jurisdiction where the Company and its Subsidiaries are
organized and qualified to do business. The organizational or governing
documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as provided to Parent

governing documents in any material respect.

 

(c) As used in this Agreement, any reference to any fact, circumstance, event,
change, effect or occurrence having a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "
means any fact, circumstance, event, change, effect or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate with all other facts, circumstances, events,
changes, effects or occurrences, (1) has had or is reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operation or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or

ability of the Company to consummate, the Merger, but, in the case of the
foregoing clause (1), shall not include the following facts, circumstances,
events, changes, effects or occurrences: (i) those generally affecting the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, or the economy

any regulatory and political conditions or developments, or (B) any outbreak
or escalation of hostilities, declared or undeclared acts of war or terrorism;

which Parent has requested or to which Parent has consented, in each case in
writing; (iv) those which the Company demonstrates through specific evidence
to have resulted proximately from the announcement of the Merger or this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including any loss

other business partners, to the extent but only to the extent so resulting);
or (v) any decline in the market price or trading volume of the equity
securities of the Company or any failure, in and of itself, of the Company to
meet any internal or public projections, forecasts or estimates of revenues or
earnings ( _provided_ that the exception in this clause (v) shall not prevent
or otherwise affect a determination that any fact, circumstance, event change,
effect or occurrence underlying such decline or failure has resulted in, or
contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ that with
respect to clauses (i) and (ii) any such fact, circumstance, event, change,
effect or occurrence does not disproportionately adversely affect the Company
and its Subsidiaries compared to other companies operating in the industries
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

with GAAP and any other applicable legal or accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions. 



 

-13- (c) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material

is recorded or made known on a timely basis to the CompanyÂ’s principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the periods in which periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act are being prepared. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the CompanyÂ’s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to material information required to be
included in the CompanyÂ’s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under

of Internal Controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Internal
Controls. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to the CompanyÂ’s auditors and audit committee
since June 30, 2005.

(e) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in

tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Entity necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and
operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they
are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure
to have any of the Company Permits would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not, and since June 30, 2004 have
not been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any material Company
Permit.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or conducts, and

Subsidiaries, to the Knowledge of the Company, is valid and enforceable.

business operations (in the manner presently carried on by the Company or such
Subsidiary). All leases under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
leases any real or personal property are in good standing, valid and
effective in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under
any of such leases, any existing default and no event has occurred which, with
notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a breach, violation or default
by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or permit termination, modification,
acceleration or repudiation by any third party thereunder, except for, in each
case, any ineffectiveness, invalidity, failure to be binding,
unenforceability, breach, violation, default, termination, modification,
acceleration or repudiation that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

concerning its business, properties and personnel as such persons may
reasonably request, except that nothing herein shall require a



 

-30- party or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information that would
reasonably be expected to cause a violation of any agreement to which such
party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or would cause a risk of a loss of
privilege to such party or any of its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant

fee or incur any unreimbursed liability in connection with the

best efforts to cause any person to whom the Company has provided documents,
data or other

consideration of any business combination involving the Company to return or
destroy any such documents, files, data or other materials in accordance with
the confidentiality agreement between the Company and such person.

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to Section 5.3(b)-(f), the Company agrees that neither it nor any
Subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall direct its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives,
including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries (" _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage (including by providing
information) or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect
to, or the making or completion of, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide or cause to be provided
any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with, or have any discussions with any person
relating to, an actual or proposed Alternative Proposal, or otherwise
knowingly encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement

Alternative Proposal, (v) amend, terminate, waive or fail to enforce, or grant
any consent under, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement, or
(vi) resolve to propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided,
however,_ it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the
Board of Directors of the Company permitted under Section 5.3(c) or (d) shall
not be deemed to be a breach or violation of this Section 5.3(a).

(b) The Company shall, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
direct each of its Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto)
that has made or indicated an intention to make an Alternative Proposal, in
each case that exist as of the date hereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(a) or (b), if the
Company receives an unsolicited Alternative Proposal from a person (other
than Parent) which did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of
Section 5.3(a), and which the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisors, is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, then, prior
to the Company Meeting (but not thereafter) the Company may, and may permit
its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, (i) furnish non-public
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Alternative Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement with such person on substantially the same
terms as and that is no less restrictive of such person than the
Confidentiality Agreements, and (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding such
Alternative Proposal; _provided, however,_ that the Company shall
simultaneously provide or make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to such
person or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made
available to Parent.

Sub, the Recommendation, (ii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to any
Alternative Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that failure to so withdraw or modify its Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may withdraw
or modify its Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such withdrawal
or modification may be made until after at least 48 hours following ParentÂ’s
receipt of written notice from the Company advising that management of the
Company currently intends to recommend to its Board of Directors that it take
such action and the basis therefor, including all necessary information under
Section 5.3(e). In determining whether to withdraw or modify its
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall taken into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by
Parent in response to such notice.

(e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Alternative Proposal or indication or
inquiry with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Alternative Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not
reasonably expected to be related to an Alternative Proposal, and (iii) any
inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding an Alternative
Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making any such
Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry and the material terms of any
such Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry (including copies of any
document or correspondence evidencing such Alternative Proposal or inquiry).
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status (including any material change to the terms thereof) of
any such Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a "stop, look and
listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of such Board
of Directors, after consultation and the receipt of advice from its outside
counsel, failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to
violate its obligations under applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that if any
such disclosure constitutes a withdrawal of the Recommendation or a
modification of the Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, Parent shall have the rights specified in Section 7.1(d)(ii) and
7.2(a)(ii).

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries



 

-33- for (i) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, tender offer,
exchange offer, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving an acquisition of the Company or
any Significant Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) the acquisition in any
manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the voting power in or
business or assets of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, in
each case other than the Merger.

fide written Alternative Proposal (i) on terms which the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal
(including the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and the identity of
the person making the proposal), and this Agreement (including any proposal
committed to by Parent in good faith to amend the terms of this Agreement and
the Merger in response to such proposal or otherwise; _provided_ that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in
the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
and Parent shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy
Statement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any oral or written
comments from the staff of the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall cooperate and provide Parent with the opportunity to review and

supplement thereto) and (ii) all written responses to requests for additional
information by and replies to written comments of the staff of the SEC, prior
to filing of the Proxy Statement with or sending such to the SEC, and the
Company will provide to Parent copies of all such filings made and
correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect thereto. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by any party
hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and
disseminated by the Company to its stockholders.

(b) The Company shall (i) take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL and the Company Charter and the Company By-laws to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Proxy



 

-34- Statement is cleared by the SEC (such meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Meeting_ "), and (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption
and approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and include its Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may
withdraw or modify its Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3(d);
_provided_ that this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall be submitted to the stockholders of
the Company at the Company Meeting for the purpose of approving this
Agreement, the Merger and such other transactions contemplated hereby and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation, _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have withdrawn or modified its Recommendation in accordance with
Section 5.3(d), then in submitting this Agreement to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement
to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders without Recommendation (although the resolutions
adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors of the Company may communicate
the basis for its lack of Recommendation to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders in the
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by applicable law.

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period following the Effective Time until December 31, 2008, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee of the

base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits, in each
case, that are no less favorable than such annual base salary and base wages,
cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (x) Parent shall or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose employment
terminates during the one-year period following the Effective Time with
severance benefits in an amount that is equal to the severance benefits that
such Company Employee would have been entitled to pursuant to and under
circumstances consistent with the terms of the CompanyÂ’s severance plan
applicable to such Company Employee; _provided_ , that such severance benefits
shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the
Effective Time in base salary or base wages paid to Company Employees and
shall take into account the service crediting provisions set forth in Section
5.5(b) below, and (y) the Company shall be entitled to establish a retention
plan (the " _Retention Plan_ ") pursuant to which awards in the aggregate not
in excess of the amount set forth on Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter may be granted by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to such
officers and employees (other than Key Employees and any other employee who is
a party to a retention agreement or severance agreement with the Company) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries specified by, and payable on such terms and
conditions as determined by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company after
consultation with the senior management of Parent. Parent shall or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor the Retention Plan in accordance with its
terms. 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent

Company Benefits Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit
plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any final
average pay defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
to the extent legally permissible, (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable
coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employeeÂ’s participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Benefit Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, provided that, subject to the requirements of Section 5.5(a), nothing
herein shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating
any particular Company Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms or
applicable Law.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.5 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any
other individual associate therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of the Agreement and nothing herein shall be construed
as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan for any purpose.

Date); _provided_ that no party shall become subject to, or consent or agree
to any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a
Governmental Entity, unless such requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order is binding on such party only in the event that the Closing
occurs; and, _provided, further,_ that nothing in this Agreement, or any
"reasonable best efforts" standard generally, shall be deemed to require
Parent to proffer to, or agree to, or to permit the Company to proffer to or
agree to, with respect to assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate or agree to sell, divest,

actions) or to agree to any changes (including through a licensing
arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of ParentÂ’s ability to
own or operate, any such assets, licenses, product lines, businesses or
interests therein or ParentÂ’s ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or
otherwise exercise full



 

-37- ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation, if
and to the extent that any such conduct, action or agreement would be
reasonably likely to result in any adverse term, condition, limitation or
effect that would be material (measured on a scale relative to the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) to Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation (such adverse term, condition, limitation or effect a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and the other

opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any

with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed

extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means any and all
state, federal and foreign statutes, rules, regulations,

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "business
combination," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover
statute or regulation shall become applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the date of this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
herein and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute
or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be construed to permit Parent or Merger

waiver of any of the CompanyÂ’s rights under, any other provision of this
Agreement.



 

-38- Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release, employee communication or other public statement or comment

shall be a joint release of Parent and the Company.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor
of the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect and
Parent shall honor such obligations.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent to
which the Company would be permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current
and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, together with such personÂ’s heirs, executor or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (and shall advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law
provided the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened Action, arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have

directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or taken by them at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an

was at the request or for the benefit of the Company).

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase, and, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, a fully pre-
paid "tail" policy to the current policy of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance maintained as of the date hereof by the Company (the " _Current
Policy_ "), which tail policy shall cover a period from the Effective Time
through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at
the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain no less
favorable coverage (including the scope and amount thereof) as, and contain
terms and conditions that are equivalent to, the coverage set forth in the
Current Policy; _provided_ that the cost thereof does not exceed 400% of the
aggregate amount per annum that the Company and its Subsidiaries paid for
such coverage in its last full fiscal year.



 

-39- (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the Company Charter or Company By-laws or other organization documents
of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the
contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties.

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, to the
extent not otherwise occurring by operation of law, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.9 . The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be
deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive
or impair any rights to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 5.9 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any
such policies. 

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partyÂ’s Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the
Conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or
satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any
provision of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or
non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice; and, _provided,
further,_ that the failure to give prompt notice hereunder pursuant to clause
(iii) shall not constitute a failure of a Condition to the Merger set forth in
Article VI except to the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not
so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure.

Section 5.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



 

-40- Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partyÂ’s
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the CompanyÂ’s operations prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent and expressly shall not be a liability
of stockholders of the Company.

Section 5.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.2(a)

required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 7.2(a) shall be

the Merger and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

notification shall only be effective on the date specified in such notice or
five (5) Business Days after the notice is given, whichever is later.
Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver because of
changed address or facsimile of which no notice was given shall be deemed to
be receipt of the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal or
inability to deliver.

Section 8.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties,
except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all of
its rights, interest and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Any attempt to make any
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Parent shall cause Merger Sub, and any assignee thereof, to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and shall be responsible for any failure of
Merger Sub or such assignee to comply with any representation, warranty,
covenant or other provision of this Agreement.

Section 8.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any person (including the officers and directors of
Parent, the Company and Merger Sub) or circumstance is determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances
other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will
remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination, the parties will negotiate in
good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute
provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter)
and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and, except as set forth in Section 5.9, is not intended
to and shall not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.



 

-48- Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver,
by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided, however,_
that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or
waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the Nasdaq National Market or Nasdaq Global Select Market, as the case may
be, require further approval of the stockholders of the Company or Parent, the
effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
the stockholders of the Company or Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. 

Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
