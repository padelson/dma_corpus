         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made as of this 9th day of August,
2001 by and among Fresh International Corp., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), Performance Food Group Company, a Tennessee corporation ("Parent"),
and PFGC Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Acquisition Sub").

                                  WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, Parent has formed Acquisition Sub for the purposes of merging
with and into the Company (the "Merger") and acquiring the Company as a wholly
owned subsidiary;

         WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Acquisition Sub and the Company,
and Parent as the sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub, have each approved the
terms of the Merger; and

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as an
inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain Common Stockholders
have entered into a Voting Agreement (the "Voting Agreement"), the form of which
is attached hereto as Exhibit 1, pursuant to which each such Common Stockholder
agrees, among other things, to vote any and all of such Common Stockholder's
shares of Common Stock in favor of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

         I.       CLOSING. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP,
located at 333 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California, on the commencement
of business on the fourth Business Day following (a) the satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth herein
(other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied on the Closing
Date) and (b) the first to occur of (i) the date and time that Parent notifies
the Company that it has sufficient funds for the payment of the Initial Merger
Consideration and the Closing Date Payments and (ii) November 9, 2001, or at
such other place and on such other date and time as the parties may mutually
agree in writing (the time and date on which the Closing occurs hereinafter is
referred to as the "Closing Date").

         II.      THE MERGER.

         2.1      Stockholders' Approval. The Company shall, promptly following
execution of this Agreement and in no event later than forty (40) days after the
date hereof, submit this Agreement and the terms of the Merger to the Common
Stockholders for approval in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL.

         2.2      The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Agreement of Merger, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
pursuant to the Agreement of Merger, with the Company as the surviving
corporation (in such capacity, the "Surviving Corporation"), the


<PAGE>   8

separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company, as
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, shall continue its corporate existence
under the laws of the State of Delaware.

         2.3      Consummation of the Merger; Effects of Merger. Pursuant to the
DGCL, the parties hereto shall cause the Agreement of Merger and related
certificates to be filed, as promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, in the
offices of the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective immediately upon the filing of the Agreement of Merger and
related certificates with the office of the Secretary of State for the State of
Delaware in accordance with the DGCL (the date and time of such filing being the
"Effective Time"). At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Acquisition Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company
and Acquisition Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         2.4      Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and
Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (a)      At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to be
identical to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of
Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
amended or repealed as provided therein or by applicable law.

                  (b)      The directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors are elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c)      The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold
office until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal.

         2.5      Closing Payments.

                  (a)      At the Closing, the Company shall (i) pay, or cause
to be paid, the Company Indebtedness, (ii) except as otherwise agreed in writing
among the Parent, the Company and any holder (each, a "Unit Holder") of a
phantom stock unit (a "Unit") issued under the Phantom Stock Plan, pay to the
Disbursement Agent for distribution to the Unit Holders the aggregate amount
owed on the Closing Date under each vested and unvested Unit that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Phantom Deferred Compensation"),
(iii) pay, or cause to be paid, the aggregate amount owed under the Company's
value creation pool (the "Other Deferred Compensation" and together with the
Phantom Deferred Compensation, the "Deferred Compensation") and (iv) pay, or
cause to be paid, all fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including without
limitation the fees payable to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (the "Closing
Fees" and, collectively with the Company Indebtedness and the Deferred
Compensation, the "Closing Date Payments"). The amount of the Closing Date
Payments shall


                                       2
<PAGE>   9

be transferred on the Closing Date from Parent to the Company on behalf of and
for the benefit of the Common Stockholders or, at the Representatives' option,
Parent shall satisfy the Company's obligations set forth in this Section 2.5 by
paying such amounts directly to the recipients thereof on the Closing Date. Not
less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a statement (the "Closing Payment Statement") setting forth the amount
of the Closing Date Payments.

                  (b)      At the Closing, Parent shall deposit cash in the
amount of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (the "Escrow Amount") in an
escrow account to be maintained with Wilmington Trust Company (the "Escrow
Agent"), which shall be held in connection with (i) any potential payments to
Parent by the Common Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.7 of this Agreement and
(ii) any potential reimbursement of Parent from the Escrow Fund pursuant to
Section 9.1 of this Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held under the terms
of an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") substantially in the form of
Exhibit 2 attached hereto.

         2.6      Conversion of Outstanding Capital Stock. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

                  (a)      Each share of Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares as to
which appraisal rights are perfected under Section 262 of the DGCL and any
shares of Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any Subsidiary) shall be
canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into and become a right
to receive an amount, payable without interest at the Closing, in cash equal to
the quotient of the Initial Merger Consideration divided by the number of Common
Shares Outstanding (the "Initial Per Share Merger Consideration"). The "Initial
Merger Consideration" shall equal Two Hundred Ninety Million Dollars
($290,000,000) (i) minus the Closing Date Payments, (ii) plus the amount by
which (A) ninety-five percent (95%) of the Estimated Closing Date Net Worth
exceeds (B) the net worth of the Company on July 31, 2001 calculated in
accordance with the methodology set forth in Exhibit 3 (it being acknowledged by
all parties that the numbers contained in Exhibit 3 are for illustrative
purposes only) and otherwise calculated in accordance with GAAP (the "Baseline
Net Worth") or minus the amount by which (x) the Baseline Net Worth exceeds (y)
ninety-five percent (95%) of the Estimated Closing Date Net Worth, (iii) less
the Escrow Amount, (iv) plus the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the

         2.7      Net Worth Adjustment.

                  (a)      Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company will in good faith estimate, on a reasonable basis using
the Company's then available financial information, the Closing Date Net Worth
(such estimate, the "Estimated Closing Date Net Worth").

                  (b)      As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, and in
any event no later than forty-five (45) days thereafter, Parent shall prepare in
good faith and on a reasonable basis a closing statement reflecting the Closing
Date Net Worth (the "Closing Statement"), and furnish to the Representatives the
Closing Statement together with the Parent's underlying workpapers pertaining
thereto. The Representatives shall have the right to review the Closing
Statement and such underlying work papers and to dispute or disagree with the
Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall become final and binding for
purposes of this Agreement unless the Representatives shall have furnished
written notice to Parent of any dispute or disagreement with the Closing
Statement within thirty (30) days after the Representatives' receipt of the
same. Such notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the nature and extent of
such dispute or disagreement.

                  (c)      If the Representatives timely notify Parent of any
dispute or disagreement with the Closing Statement, the Representatives and
Parent shall negotiate to resolve such dispute or disagreement in good faith. If
the Representatives and Parent are unable to resolve such dispute or
disagreement within thirty (30) days after receipt by Parent of the
Representatives' written notice of dispute or disagreement, Parent or the
Representatives shall jointly retain an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing, other than any such accounting firm having a
relationship with any of the parties hereto (the "Firm"), to resolve any
remaining disputes. The Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine and resolve
such dispute or disagreement, based solely on the presentations by the
Representatives and Parent and not by independent audit. The Firm shall make its
determination regarding such dispute or disagreement within thirty (30) days
after the date upon which the Representatives and Parent submit the dispute or
disagreement, together with their presentation and evidence, and in that
undertaking shall not be required to follow any particular procedure but shall
proceed in a manner designed to achieve a prompt and economic resolution of the
dispute. The Firm shall set forth its determination, which shall be binding and
conclusive, in a written statement delivered to Parent and the Representatives,
stating its reasons therefor.

                  (d)      Promptly following the date upon which the Closing
Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Section 2.7, but not later than five (5) Business Days after such date,
(i) Parent shall pay to the disbursement agent designated by the Representatives
(the "Disbursement Agent"), for immediate distribution to the Common
Stockholders and the Unit Holders pursuant to a disbursement agent agreement
(the "Disbursement Agent Agreement") in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and Parent, as additional Merger Consideration, (A)
the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Net Worth, as reflected on the
final and binding Closing Statement (the "Final Closing Date Net Worth"),
exceeds ninety-five percent (95%) of the Estimated Closing Date Net Worth used
to determine the Initial Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6 plus (B)
an amount equal to 38% of the portion of the amount owed pursuant to Section
2.7(d)(i)(A) which is to be paid, pursuant to the Phantom Stock Plan and/or the
Company's value creation pool, to the beneficiaries thereof as calculated by the
Representatives, which portion shall in no event be


                                       4
<PAGE>   11

greater than 12.5% of the aggregate amount owed pursuant to Section
2.7(d)(i)(A), or (ii) the Representatives shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to
Parent from the Escrow Fund, the amount, if any, by which ninety-five percent
(95%) of the Estimated Closing Date Net Worth used to determine the Initial
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6 exceeds the Final Closing Date Net
Worth; provided, however, that interest at the rate of four and one-half percent
(4.5%) per annum shall accrue on, and be payable with respect to, the amount of
any payment under this Section 2.7 from the Closing Date until the date upon
which such payment is actually made.

         2.8      Contingent Payment.

                  (a)      As additional Merger Consideration, Parent shall pay
to the Disbursement Agent, for immediate distribution to the Common Stockholders
and Unit Holders pursuant to the Disbursement Agent Agreement, (i) an amount
(the "Contingent Payment") equal to (A) Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000)
multiplied by the sum of (I) a fraction, so long as such fraction is 1/2 or
greater, the numerator of which is gross revenues from sales of fresh fruit
("Fruit Sales") by the Company (determined in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 2.8(c)) during any consecutive twelve (12) month period
beginning on or after the Closing Date as set forth in any Final Calculation and
the denominator of which is Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), (II) a fraction,
so long as such fraction is 1/2 or greater, the numerator of which is the
aggregate value of realized synergies (determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.8(c)) ("Synergies") during any consecutive
twelve (12) month period beginning on or after the Closing Date as set forth in
any Final Calculation and the denominator of which is Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) and (III) provided that the Company's operating income for a given
calendar year calculated in accordance with Exhibit 5 ("Operating Income") is in
excess of the operating income targets for that calendar year as set forth on
Exhibit 5, 100%, less (B) the aggregate amount previously paid pursuant to
Section 2.8(a)(i) plus (ii) an amount equal to 38% of the portion of the amount
owed pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) which is to be paid, pursuant to the Phantom
Stock Plan and/or the Company's value creation pool, to the beneficiaries
thereof as calculated by the Representatives, which portion will in no event be
greater than 12.5% of the aggregate amount owed pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i).
In no event shall the Contingent Payment exceed Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000).

                  (b)      The Contingent Payment shall be paid to the
Disbursement Agent within ten (10) days after determination of the Final
Calculation pursuant to Section 2.8(c) below and at the written request of the
Representatives in cash or immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by the Disbursement Agent.

                  (c)      Not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of
the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2001 and each of the calendar quarters
ending on the last day of March, June, September and December of 2002, 2003 and
2004 (the "Quarterly Periods"), Parent will prepare and present to the
Representatives the calculations of Fruit Sales, Synergies and Operating Income
for each month since the Closing Date for each Quarterly Period ending December
31, 2001, March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002 and, for all
other Quarterly Periods, each twelve (12) month period ending on each month
during such Quarterly Period (the "Proposed Calculations"). The parties agree
that each Proposed Calculation shall be prepared so that it presents fairly the
Fruit Sales, Synergies and Operating Income for such periods using practices and
procedures specified in Exhibit 5 hereto. The Representatives and


                                       5
<PAGE>   12

the Representative's auditors shall have the right to review and copy, promptly
upon request, the workpapers of Parent utilized in preparing the Proposed
Calculations for purposes of verifying the accuracy of the Proposed
Calculations. The Proposed Calculations shall be binding upon the parties to
this Agreement unless the Representatives give written notice of disagreement
with any of said values or amounts or items in the Proposed Calculations to
Parent within thirty (30) Business Days after their receipt of the Proposed
Calculations, specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of such
disagreement. If Parent and the Representatives mutually agree upon the Proposed
Calculations within thirty (30) Business Days after Parent's receipt of such
notice from the Representatives, such agreement shall be binding upon the
parties to this Agreement. If the Representatives timely notify Parent of any
dispute or disagreement with the Proposed Calculations, the Representatives and
Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute or disagreement. If
the Representatives and Parent are unable to resolve such dispute within thirty
(30) days after receipt by Parent of the Representatives' written notice of
dispute or disagreement, Parent and the Representatives shall jointly retain a
Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. The Firm shall act as an arbitrator to
determine and resolve such dispute or disagreement, based solely on the
presentations by the Representatives and Parent and not by independent audit.
The Firm shall make its determination regarding such dispute or disagreement
within thirty (30) days after the date upon which the Representatives and Parent
submit the dispute or disagreement, together with their presentation and
evidence, and in that undertaking shall not be required to follow any particular
procedure but shall proceed in a manner designed to achieve a prompt and
economic resolution of the dispute. The Firm shall set forth its determination,
which shall be binding and conclusive, in a written statement delivered to
Parent and the Representatives, stating its reasons therefor. The Proposed
Calculations as finally determined pursuant to the method described in this
Section 2.8(c) with respect to any Quarterly Period shall be referred to as the
"Final Calculation."

         2.9      Appraisal Rights. Common Stockholders who have complied with
all requirements for demanding and perfecting appraisal rights as set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Stockholders") are entitled to their rights
under such laws. Each share of Common Stock held by Dissenting Stockholders
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration set forth herein. Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled
to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares held by them in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Each share of Common
Stock held by holders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section
262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, when and as payable under the terms of this Agreement,
without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section
2.10, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares.
The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any assertions of
appraisal rights or withdrawals of assertions of appraisal rights, and any other
instrument in respect thereof received by the Company and the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL.

         2.10     Exchange of Certificates.

                  (a)      Upon the surrender to the Surviving Corporation of
each certificate representing shares of Common Stock and a duly executed letter
of transmittal (each, a "Letter of Transmittal") related thereto, the holder of
such certificate shall be entitled to receive in


                                       6
<PAGE>   13

exchange therefor by check or wire transfer (as selected by such holder) an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
evidenced by such certificate and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, when
and as payable under the terms of this Agreement, and such certificate shall,
after such surrender, be marked as canceled.

                  (b)      If any consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in which the certificate or option surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Surviving Corporation any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a Person
other than that of the registered holder of the certificate or option so
surrendered, or such Person shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

                  (c)      At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no transfers of any
shares of Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, certificates previously
representing the Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the appropriate Merger Consideration, when
and as payable under the terms of this Agreement.

                  (d)      The Company shall request each Common Stockholder to
submit to Parent, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing,
instructions for delivery of the Initial Merger Consideration. At the Closing,
and upon the surrender by each Common Stockholder of all of such Common
Stockholder's certificates representing shares of Common Stock, along with a
duly executed and delivered Letter of Transmittal related thereto, Parent shall
cause Acquisition Sub to pay the Initial Merger Consideration calculated in
accordance with Section 2.10(a) to the Disbursement Agent for disbursement to
the respective Common Stockholders, in each case in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Disbursement Agent Agreement and the payment instructions
delivered to Parent.

                  (e)      Any portion of the Merger Consideration that would
have been paid with respect to shares held by a Dissenting Stockholder shall be
deposited with the Disbursement Agent for distribution in accordance with the
terms of the Disbursement Agent Agreement.

         III.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.

         any manner that would result in the Company or any Subsidiary paying
         any Person in excess of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000);

                           (ix)     fail to comply in any material respect with
         (A) all Laws applicable to it and the Business and (B) all Laws
         compliance with which is required for the valid consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

                           (x)      agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to
         do any of the foregoing.

                  (b)      The Company covenants and agrees that, prior to the
Closing, it shall, to the extent that it has knowledge of any of the following,
promptly notify Parent in writing of all events, circumstances, facts and
occurrences arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement which could
reasonably be expected to result in any material breach of a representation or
warranty or covenant of the Company in this Agreement.

                  (c)      The Company will use reasonable efforts to maintain
and preserve and keep in full force and effect the existence and material rights
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to preserve the material business
organizations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to keep available to Parent
the officers and key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to
preserve the present relationships of the Company with its material suppliers
and customers.

         5.2      Access to Records and Properties. From the date hereof until
the Closing Date or earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company will, and
will cause each Subsidiary to:


                                       26
<PAGE>   33
                  (a)      upon notice by Parent and permission granted by the
Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provide Parent and
Acquisition Sub and their officers, counsel and other representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the facilities of the Company
and such Subsidiary, their principal personnel and representatives, and such
books and records pertaining to Company and such Subsidiary as Parent and
Acquisition Sub may reasonably request, provided that Parent and Acquisition Sub
agree that such access will give due regard to minimizing interference with the
operations, activities or employees of Company and such Subsidiary and provided
that such access and disclosure would not violate the terms of any agreement to
which the Company or any such Subsidiary is bound or any applicable Law;

                  (b)      furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub or their
representatives such additional financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Company and each Subsidiary as may be reasonably
requested, to the extent that such access and disclosure would not violate the
terms of any agreement to which the Company or any such Subsidiary is bound or
any applicable Law.

         5.3      Consents.

                  (a)      Each of the Company and Parent shall, in no event
later than five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, file with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report form pursuant to
the HSR Act), required for the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, substantially comply with
any request for additional information and documents pursuant to the HSR Act.
Each of Parent and the Company shall inform the other promptly of any
communication made by or on behalf of such party to, or received from, the FTC
or the DOJ and shall furnish to the other such information and assistance as the
other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filing,
submission or other act that is necessary or advisable under the HSR Act. The
Company and Parent shall keep each other timely apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC or the DOJ, and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request. The parties hereto acknowledge that time shall be of the essence in
this Agreement and agree not to take any action or omit to take any action that
will have the effect of unreasonably delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt
of any required authorizations, consents, orders or approvals.

                  (b)      The parties hereto shall cooperate with one another
in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority (excluding the actions and filings described in clause
(a) above) is required or reasonably appropriate, or any action, consent,
approval or waiver from any party to any Material Contract is required or
reasonably appropriate, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, in taking such actions or making
any such filings, the parties hereto shall furnish information required in
connection therewith and timely seek to obtain any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers.

                  (c)      Without limiting the generality of Parent's
undertakings pursuant to Section 5.3(a), Parent shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain any clearance under the


                                       27
<PAGE>   34

HSR Act or to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable antitrust,
anti-competition or similar Law, in each case as promptly as practicable;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall require Parent to take
any such action if the taking of such action could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or deprive
Parent of the economic benefit of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any material respect.

         5.4      Public Announcements. On and after the date hereof and through
the Closing Date, the Company, Acquisition Sub and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any press release or make any public
statement prior to obtaining the other parties' written approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, in the event of any press
release or public statement that is required by Law, the parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before issuing, and to
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any such press
release or other public statement.

         5.5      Non-Solicitation. After the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date, the Company agrees (i) that it shall, and shall direct its
directors, officers, employees, advisors, accountants and attorneys, not to
initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the
making or implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
acquisition, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company, or any
purchase of all or any significant portion of the assets or any equity
securities of the Company (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred
to as an "Acquisition Proposal") or engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with,
any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any
effort to attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) that it
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties other than Parent conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing; and (iii) that it will notify
Parent immediately if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such negotiations or discussions are
sought to be initiated or continued with, it. Parent agrees that this Section
5.5 shall be of no force and effect in the event of termination of this
Agreement or in the event the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated.

         5.6      Further Action. Each of the parties hereto shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper and advisable under
applicable Law, and execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may
be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         5.7      Insurance; Indemnity.

                  (a)      For a period of six (6) years following the Effective
Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and shall advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law to) each Person who is now or has
been an officer, director, employee or agent of the Company (or any Subsidiary),
including, without limitation, each Person controlling any of the foregoing
persons


                                       28
<PAGE>   35

(individually, an "Indemnified Individual" and collectively, the "Indemnified
Individuals"), against (i) all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action arising
out of or pertaining to acts or omissions (including negligent acts or
omissions), or alleged acts or omissions (including alleged negligent acts or
omissions), by them in their capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or
claimed before or after the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities") and (ii)
all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on or arising out of or
pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (b)      Immediately before the Effective Time, Parent shall
purchase and maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase and
maintain, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance covering the Indemnified
Individuals who are currently covered by the Company's existing directors and
officers liability insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time and providing at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms that are no less advantageous to the
insured parties as those in effect on the date hereof; provided that in no event
shall Parent, after using its reasonable best efforts to obtain a policy with
the same coverage and terms at the lowest cost, be required to expend for the
policy or policies an aggregate amount in excess of $90,000, and provided
further that if the aggregate costs of such insurance are less than $90,000, the
Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage it can
obtain upon the exercise of its reasonable best efforts for an amount not
exceeding $90,000.

                  (c)      The provisions of this Section 5.7 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Individual and
each party entitled to insurance coverage under Section 5.7(b), respectively,
and his or her heirs and legal representatives, and shall be in addition to any
other rights an Indemnified Individual may have under the certificate or
articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational document) of the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary, under the DGCL or otherwise. The
obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent contained in
this Section 5.7 shall be binding on the successors and assigns of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.7.

         5.8      Benefit Plans.

                  (a)      For one year after the Effective Time, at the option
of Parent (which may be applied on a plan basis and/or separately to different
groups of employees), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
offer to those Persons employed by the Company or any Subsidiary and eligible to
participate in the employee benefit plans (other than the Company's Phantom
Stock Plan or any other nonqualified deferred compensation plans) ("Benefit
Plans") maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary immediately prior to the


                                       29
<PAGE>   36

Effective Time (determined without regard to any termination of the same
pursuant to Section 5.8(c)) ("Company Persons") and dependents thereof, either:

                           (i)      continued rights to participate in the
         Benefit Plans on substantially the same basis as in effect immediately
         prior to the Effective Time, subject to any changes required by
         applicable law, and to the right to convert the vesting schedule for
         matching contributions in the Company's 401(k) plan to the vesting
         schedule for matching contributions in the Parent's 401(k) plan, or

                           (ii)     rights to participate in Parent's or the
         Surviving Corporation's employee benefit plans ("Parent Benefit Plans")
         on substantially the same basis as similarly situated employees (taking
         into account all applicable factors including, without limitation,
         position, location of employment, employment classification, age,
         length of service, pay, part time or full time status), provided that
         with respect to any health insurance plan, such participation for all
         Company Persons and dependents thereof who were participating in the
         Company's health insurance plans shall be available without exclusions
         for pre-existing conditions, and provided further that expenses that
         were taken into account under a Benefit Plan providing medical or
         dental benefits in which the Company Persons participated immediately
         prior to commencing participation in a Parent Benefit Plan providing
         medical or dental benefits shall be taken into account to the same
         extent under such Parent Benefit Plan, in accordance with the terms of
         such Parent Benefit Plan, for purposes of satisfying applicable
         deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions and
         life-time benefit limits;

provided, however, that the value of coverages and benefits offered to each of
such Company Persons and dependents thereof shall be, in the aggregate,
substantially equivalent to the value of coverages and benefits of the Benefit
Plans in which each of such Company Persons and dependents thereof participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of participation in any
Parent Benefit Plan, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall recognize the
past service of Company Persons with the Company and its Subsidiaries for
vesting and eligibility purposes only.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
5.8 and in lieu of providing participation in employee benefit plans pursuant to
Section 5.8(a), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
to those Persons employed by the Company and any Subsidiary under (i) the
collective bargaining agreements which the Company and its Subsidiaries are
subject to, the benefits required under those collective bargaining agreements,
and (ii) employment agreements, the benefits (other than participation in the
Company's Phantom Stock Plan after the Closing) required under such agreements.

                  (c)      The Company will terminate and will cause each
Subsidiary to terminate effective as of the Closing each and any Pension Plan of
the Company or any Subsidiary that is subject to Section 401(k) of the Code, on
or before the Closing Date if so directed in writing by Parent, which
termination may be contingent on Closing and which direction may include a
requirement that all benefits be paid out prior to or at Closing in which case
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall assume no liability therefor.

         5.9      No Financing Contingency. Parent will have at the Effective
Time sufficient funds for the payment of the Initial Merger Consideration and
the Closing Date Payments and to


                                       30
<PAGE>   37

perform its obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere herein, the parties
acknowledge and agree that it shall not be a condition to the obligations of
Parent or Acquisition Sub to effect the Initial Merger that Parent has
sufficient funds for the payment of the Initial Merger Consideration and the
Closing Date Payments and to perform its obligations with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         5.10     Tax Returns. With respect to any Tax Returns of the Company
due after the Closing Date with respect to any year or period during which the
Company was an S Corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the
Code, Parent shall prepare such Tax Returns and shall report all items with
respect to any such periods in accordance with the instructions of the
Representatives, provided that such instructions shall be consistent with past
practice of the Company and that Parent shall have reasonable opportunity to
provide reasonable input to the Representatives with respect to such Tax Returns
and the Representatives shall consider such input in good faith. With respect to
any other Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to any
year or period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare such
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practice (with the Company electing
to file a consolidated federal income tax return with the Subsidiaries), shall
cause the Company to consult with the Representatives concerning such Tax
Returns and shall provide the Representatives reasonable opportunity to provide
reasonable input to Parent with respect to such Tax Returns. Parent agrees that
it shall not, and it shall cause the Company not to, amend any Tax Return of the
Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any year or period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date without the prior consent of the Representatives (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless required to do so by
applicable law.

         5.11     Review of Parent Change of Control Agreements. Parent agrees
that, as soon as may be practicable following the Closing and in any event
within one year of the Closing, it will review in good faith the existing
policies and agreements regarding compensation and benefits to its employees
following a change of control of Parent and make such changes or modifications,
if any, as it, in its discretion, may determine.

         5.12     Environmental Diligence and Reimbursement. Parent shall be
entitled to conduct continued environment diligence with respect to the
properties identified in Section 5.12 of the Disclosure Schedule in accordance
with the terms set forth in Section 5.2. On or before August 30, 2001, Parent
shall submit to the Company all of the data and materials it has or its
representatives have collected as a result of such diligence together with a
good faith estimate of the aggregate cost of fully remediating all environmental
issues identified as a result of such environmental diligence (the "Remediation
Cost"). Within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such data and estimate, the
Company shall decide, in its sole discretion, to (a) agree that the Initial
Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of the Remediation Cost or
(b) after negotiating in good faith with Parent as to amount of the Remediation
Cost, terminate this Agreement.

         5.13     Texas Operations. Parent will not use and will not permit the
use of any of the assets used in the Business in a manner that would violate
Section 22.3 of the Taylor Agreement.

         5.14     Benefit Filings. Prior to Closing, the Company shall file or
supplement a previous filing for any due and not yet filed annual return/report
(Form 5500 Series, with related


                                       31
<PAGE>   38

schedules) or statements in lieu of such annual return/report relating to any
Plan. The Company shall be liable for all costs associated with such filings,
including any excise taxes, penalties, or fees. The Company shall be liable for
any and all costs, including taxes, penalties and interest, associated with any
failure by it or any Subsidiary to comply with the written plan document
requirement under Section 125 of the Code for any contributions erroneously
treated by it or any Subsidiary as pretax contributions excluded from an
employee's income and wages for income and employment tax purposes for any
period prior to Closing; and the Company at its expense shall use its best
efforts to correct or cause any affected Subsidiary to correct any such written
plan document deficiency prior to Closing.

         5.15     Unsigned Leases. For each lease identified in Section 3.6(c)
of the Disclosure Schedule as being unsigned on the date hereof, any definitive
lease agreement entered into by the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the
Closing shall be on substantially the same terms as those in effect on the date
hereof or on terms approved by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

         5.16     Modification of Escrow Agreement. As soon as practicable, but
in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company
and Parent will agree as to the maximum exposure of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Tax liabilities attributable to the nondeductibility under
Section 280G and/or 162 of the Code with respect to payments of Deferred
Compensation and other payments to or for the benefit of Unit Holders pursuant
to this Agreement. In the event the Company and Parent cannot agree, Parent and
the Company shall jointly retain a Firm to determine such amount, such
determination to be not less five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, and
such amount (or the amount agreed by the Company and Parent) shall be the
"Exposure Amount". In the event the Exposure Amount is more than $250,000, the
Company and Parent shall amend the form of Escrow Agreement to be executed and
delivered at Closing to provide that the amount of Escrow Funds to be released
by the Escrow Agent on the first Business Day following the first anniversary of
Closing shall be reduced by the Exposure Amount.

         VI.      CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB.

         The obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the fulfillment,
in all material respects, of each of the following conditions by the Company on
or before the Closing Date, unless waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub:

         6.1      No Litigation. No litigation brought by a Governmental
Authority shall be pending, and no litigation shall be threatened by any
Governmental Authority, which seeks to enjoin or prohibit the consummation of
the Merger, and no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other
legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall
be in effect.

         6.2      Truth of Representations and Warranties.

                  (a)      Subject to Section 6.2(b), (i) the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
or document delivered to Parent and Acquisition Sub pursuant hereto that are
qualified by materiality shall be true and correct in all


                                       32
<PAGE>   39

respects when made and on the Closing Date, with the same force and effect as
though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the
Closing Date (other than for such representations and warranties made as of
another date, which shall, in all respects, be true and correct as of such
date), and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered to Parent and Acquisition
Sub pursuant hereto that are not qualified by materiality shall be true and
correct in all material respects when made and on the Closing Date, with the
same force and effect as though such representations and warranties had been
made on and as of the Closing Date (other than for such representations and
warranties made as of another date, which shall, in all material respects, be
true and correct as of such date), (ii) except where the failure of any of such
representations and warranties referenced in this Section 6.2(a) to be true and
correct would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall deliver a
certificate of an appropriate officer thereof relating to such representations
and warranties, as well as the covenants made herein by the Company, as provided
in Section 6.3.

                  (b)      In the event of a failure to satisfy the conditions
set forth in clause (i) of Section 6.2(a), the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(a) will be deemed satisfied in all respects only if, prior to Closing, the
Company either (i) reimburses Parent to its reasonable satisfaction for any Loss
resulting from or arising out of any breaches of representations or warranties
that would otherwise cause the conditions set forth in clause (i) of Section
6.2(a) not to be met whether or not any such breach would have a Material
Adverse Effect, or (ii) cures any such breach to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent, with Parent acting in good faith in each of clause (i) and (ii) above;
provided, however, that the Representatives will not have to so agree and the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) will still be met if Parent had actual
knowledge on or before the date hereof that the representation or warranty that
would otherwise cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a)(i) not to be
met was or would be inaccurate.

         6.3      Fulfillment of Covenants. The Company shall have performed or
complied with, in all material respects, all of the covenants, obligations and
agreements contained in this Agreement to be performed and complied with by it

amendments have been made to such certificate of incorporation (or similar
document) since such date, and (ii) the bylaws (or similar organizational
documents) of the Company and of each Subsidiary, certified by the Secretary or
Assistant Secretary of each such entity.

the Closing Date (other than for such representations and warranties made as of
another date, which shall, in all material respects, be true and correct as of
such date), except where the failure of any of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct would not have a Parent Material Adverse

         VIII.    TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

         8.1      Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time:

                  (a)      by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company,
if the Board of Directors of each so determines by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the members of its entire Board of Directors;

                  (b)      by Parent (provided that Parent is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein), upon a material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in
either case continuing twenty (20) days following notice to the Company of such
breach or untruth and of a nature such that the conditions set forth in Section
6.2 or Section 6.3, as the case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by
November 15, 2001;

                  (c)      by the Company (provided that the Company is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein), upon a material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub
shall have become untrue, in either case continuing twenty (20) days following
notice to Parent of such breach or untruth (provided that in no event shall
Parent be entitled to notice of or to cure a breach of Section 5.9 before the
Company can exercise its right to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)) and
of a nature such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as
the case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by November 15, 2001;

                  (d)      by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
the Merger and such order, decree or ruling or other action shall have become
final and nonappealable;


                                       36
<PAGE>   43

                  (e)      by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall
not have occurred by November 15, 2001, unless the failure to consummate the
Merger is the result of a breach of covenant set forth in this Agreement or a
material breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement by
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;

                  (f)      By the Company (provided that the Company is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein), if the Merger shall not have occurred as a result of Parent
not having by November 15, 2001 sufficient funds for the payment of the Initial
Merger Consideration and the Closing Date Payments; or

                  (g)      by the Company in accordance with Section 5.12.

         8.2      Effect of Termination.

                  (a)      If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1, (i) this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force and
effect, except as provided in Sections 8.2(b), (c) and (d), and (ii) except as
provided in Section 8.2(d), none of the parties hereto (nor any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, shareholders, officers, employees, agents,
consultants, attorneys-in-fact or other representatives or any Affiliate,
director, officer, stockholder, partner (limited or general), employees, agents,
consultants, attorneys-in-fact or other representatives thereof) shall have any
liability in respect of such termination; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 8.2(a) shall relieve either party from liability for any willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement or for any breach of a covenant of this
Agreement.

                  (b)      Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the
parties hereto shall bear their respective expenses incurred in connection with
the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all fees
and expenses of counsel and accountants.

                  (c)      If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1, the parties agree that all provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and each party shall comply with its
obligations thereunder and each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
agrees that it shall be bound by the terms thereof as if it were a signatory
thereto.

                  (d)      If this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(f) of this Agreement, then not later than two (2)
Business Days after the Company has given Parent notice of such termination, the
Company shall be entitled to cause the escrow agent of the Termination Fee
Escrow Account to pay to the Company a termination fee in the amount of Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee shall
be paid from an escrow account (the "Termination Fee Escrow Account") to be
established with Wilmington Trust Company as escrow agent, or with such other
escrow agent as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree acting in good
faith, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Company acting in good faith. By not later than the close of
business on August 16, 2001, the Termination Fee Escrow Account shall be
established and Parent shall deposit into the Termination Fee Escrow Account
cash in the amount of the Termination Fee. If Closing occurs, the funds held in
the Termination Fee Escrow Account shall be released to Parent or, at Parent's
direction, paid to the Disbursement Agent and applied to payment of the Initial
Merger Consideration. If the Termination Fee becomes payable to the

                                       37
<PAGE>   44

Company as a result of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
the Termination Fee shall be treated as a non-exclusive source of recovery for
damages incurred by the Company as a result of such termination of this
Agreement, and shall not preclude the Company or the Common Stockholders from
asserting a claim against Parent for any damages in excess of the amount of the
Termination Fee which are incurred as a result of such termination.

         IX.      REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION.

         9.1      Reimbursement from Escrow Fund. Parent and Acquisition Sub,
and each director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate and successor and assign
thereof (the "Parent Parties"), shall be reimbursed from the Escrow Fund for
each claim, loss, liability, cost and expense (including without limitation,
interest, assessments, levies, fines, penalties, reasonable costs of preparation
and investigation, and the reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of
attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors) (collectively,
"Losses"), directly or indirectly relating to, resulting from or arising out of
(a) any untrue representation, misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other obligation by the Company
contained herein, in the Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate, document or
instrument delivered by the Company to Parent pursuant hereto, provided that
with respect to any breach of or misrepresentation in Section 3.17 or in Section
3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Parties shall be reimbursed only for
Losses (i) attributable to liabilities for Taxes for periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date that arise out of such breach or misrepresentation or (ii)
that result from the nondeductibility (A) under Section 280G or Section 162 of
the Code of payments to or for the benefit of the Unit Holders pursuant to
Sections 2.7, 2.8, 9.3(c), 9.3(d), 9.5 or 9.12 hereof, (B) of any portion of the
Closing Date Payments the Tax benefit from the deductibility of which was taken
into account in the final and binding Closing Statement, or (C) in any period
ending after the Closing Date, of any net operating loss carryforward from a
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date which net operating loss
carryforward was taken into account in the final and binding Closing Statement,
(b) any liability to Parent for (i) indemnification obligations under that
certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated May 25, 2000 between Fresh Express Dallas
Incorporated, Taylor Farms Texas, Inc. and Bruce C. Taylor (the "Taylor
Agreement") or for (ii) any breach of Section 22.3 thereof provided that Parent
has complied with Section 5.13 hereof and (c) the Company's obligation under
Section 5.14 to the extent such obligations are not satisfied prior to the
Closing.

         9.2      Time Limitation; Common Stockholders. If the Closing occurs,
there shall be no payments pursuant to Section 9.1, unless on or before that
date which is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, Parent notifies the
Representatives of a Loss specifying the factual basis of that Loss in
reasonable detail to the extent then known by Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any Losses by Parent for any breach of or
misrepresentation in Sections 3.11 or 3.17 or for any breach of a covenant in
Section 5.14, Parent shall be reimbursed from the Escrow Fund if (i) Parent
provides the Representatives with notice of such Loss specifying the factual
basis of that Loss in reasonable detail to the extent known by Parent on or
before that date which is four (4) years from the Closing Date (the "Fourth
Anniversary") or (ii) in the case of a Tax liability arising out of an audit
that commences on or before the Fourth Anniversary, if Parent provides notice of
the commencement of the audit to the Representatives on or before the Fourth
Anniversary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Losses by Parent
under clause (b)(i) of Section 9.1, Parent shall be reimbursed from the Escrow
Fund if Parent provides


                                       38
<PAGE>   45

the Representatives with notice of such Loss specifying the factual basis of
that Loss in reasonable detail to the extent known by Parent on or before July
1, 2003.

         9.3      Other Limitations; Escrow Amount.

                  (a)      The Escrow Funds shall constitute the sole and
exclusive source for the satisfaction of the obligations set forth in Section
9.1 and all other liabilities or obligations of the Common Stockholders under
this Agreement, and, except as otherwise expressly provided therein, any other
closing or ancillary document executed and delivered pursuant to the provisions
hereof or thereof, other than the Parent Employment Agreements, the
Non-Investment Agreements and the Non-Competition Agreement, and in no event
shall the aggregate amount of Loss for which Parent may seek reimbursement
pursuant to Section 9.1 exceed the amount of the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provisions of this Agreement, however, this Section
9.3 shall not apply to any claim based on fraud to the extent determined by a
final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  (b)      There shall not be any reimbursement obligations
under Section 9.1 until the Parent Parties have suffered aggregate Losses under
Section 9.1 in excess of Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) (the
"Loss Threshold"), provided that once the Parent Parties' aggregate Losses
exceed the Loss Threshold, the Parent Parties shall be reimbursed from the
Escrow Fund for all Losses that exceed the Loss Threshold; provided, however,
that where the aggregate amount of Losses arising out of a claim or series of
related claims pursuant to Section 9.1 does not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars
($10,000), such claim or series or related claims shall not count as Losses for
purposes of the indemnification provisions hereunder, provided this Ten Thousand
Dollar threshold shall not apply with respect to any claims arising out of a
breach of Section 3.17 or a breach of any representation or warranty that is
specifically qualified by materiality.

                  (c)      Any payment made pursuant to Section 9.1 from the
Escrow Fund in respect of any event shall be net of any insurance proceeds
recovered or recoverable by Parent Party in respect such claim. Such Parent
Party shall use its reasonable efforts to make insurance claims relating to an
event for which it is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1. In the
event that an insurance recovery is made by a Parent Party with respect to any
Loss for which a Parent Party has previously been indemnified hereunder and such
recovery is (i) within one year from the Closing Date or (ii) one year or more
after the Closing Date and the amount of the Escrow Fund (A) immediately
following the distribution required by Section 2(b) of the Escrow Agreement and
(B) on the date of such recovery is less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000),
then the Parent Parties shall promptly deposit with the Escrow Agent, to be
added to the Escrow Fund, an amount (the "Recovered Amount") equal to the lesser
of (x) the amount of such insurance recovery (net of collection expenses) and
(y) the amount previously paid on behalf of the Common Stockholders as
indemnification for such Loss. In the event that an insurance recovery is made
by a Parent Party with respect to any Loss for which a Parent Party has
previously been indemnified hereunder and the amount is not required to be
deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to the foregoing sentence, then the Parent
Parties shall promptly make pay an amount equal to the sum of (a) the Recovered
Amount and (b) an amount equal to 38% of the portion of the Recovered Amount to
be paid, pursuant to the Phantom Stock Plan and/or the Company's value creation
pool, to the beneficiaries thereof as calculated by the Representatives, which
portion shall in no event be greater than 12.5% of the aggregate Recovered
Amount, to the


                                       39
<PAGE>   46

Disbursement Agent, for distribution to the Common Stockholders and the Unit
Holders pursuant to the Disbursement Agent Agreement.

                  (d)      If the reimbursement obligation under Section 9.1
arises in respect of any event (i) for which a Parent Party receives
reimbursement pursuant to Section 9.1 (A) within one year from the Closing Date
or (B) one year or more after the Closing Date and the amount of the Escrow Fund
(x) immediately following the distribution required by Section 2(b) of the
Escrow Agreement and (y) on the date of such reimbursement is less than Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) and (ii) which results in any Tax benefit to such
Parent Party for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the
Closing Date which would not, but for such event, be available, such Parent
Party shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, to be added to the Escrow Fund, an
amount equal to the actual Tax savings produced by such Tax benefit reduced by
the amount of any Tax detriment to such Parent Party as a result of the receipt
of such reimbursement (the "Net Tax Savings"). If the reimbursement obligation
under Section 9.1 arises in respect of any event (i) for which a Parent Party
receives reimbursement pursuant to Section 9.1 and is not required to be
deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to the foregoing sentence and (ii) which
results in any Tax benefit to such Parent Party for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date which would not, but for such
event, be available, such Parent Party shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to
the Disbursement Agent, for distribution to the Common Stockholders and the Unit
Holders pursuant to the Disbursement Agent Agreement, an amount equal to the sum
of (a) the Net Tax Savings and (b) an amount equal to 38% of the portion of the
Net Tax Savings to be paid, pursuant to the Phantom Stock Plan and/or the
Company's value creation pool, to the beneficiaries thereof as calculated by the
Representatives, which portion shall in no event be greater than 12.5% of the
aggregate Net Tax Savings. Tax benefits and detriments shall be taken into
account in calculating the Net Tax Savings as and when actually realized. The
amount of any such Tax Saving for any taxable period shall be the amount of the
reduction in Taxes payable to a Tax authority by such Parent Party with respect
to such Tax period (net of any Tax detriment resulting from the receipt of the
reimbursement payment) as compared to the Taxes that would have been payable to
a Tax authority by such Parent Party with respect to such Tax period in the
absence of such Tax benefit.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding any other provision to this Agreement
to the contrary other than Section 6.2(b), if on the Closing Date a Parent Party
has actual knowledge that one or more of the representations and warranties made
by the Company was inaccurate as of the date made, the Parent Party shall have
no right or remedy after the Closing with respect to such inaccuracy and shall
be deemed to have waived its rights to reimbursement in respect thereof.

                  (f)      Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, and except in the case of fraud, neither the affiliates, directors,
stockholders, officers, employees, agents, consultants, attorneys-in-fact or
other representatives of the parties hereto, nor any of their respective
affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, partners (limited or general),
employees, agents, consultants, attorneys-in-fact or other representatives,
shall have any liability whatsoever, whether in tort or otherwise, in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any certificate,
opinion or statement given or made by any of them in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Except with respect to third-party claims or actions, any
recovery by a Parent Party from the Escrow Fund or by the Representatives or a
Common Stockholder from Parent shall be

                                       40
<PAGE>   47

limited to actual direct losses, and shall not include punitive damages,
consequential damages, lost profits or rents, diminution in the value of real
property or business interruption losses incurred by the Parent Party or the
Representatives or Common Stockholders, as the case may be.

         9.4      Tax Treatment. Amounts paid from the Escrow Fund or to the
Common Stockholders as indemnification shall be treated as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

         9.5      Assignment of Claims. If a Parent Party receives any payment
from the Escrow Fund in respect of any Losses pursuant to Section 9.1 and the
Parent Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third
party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted against
the Company or the Common Stockholder(s), the Parent Party shall assign, on a
non-recourse basis and without any representation or warranty, such of its
rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit
the Representatives to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such
payment. Any payment received in respect of such claim shall be distributed (i)
first (A) to the Escrow Agent, to be added to the Escrow Fund, if such payment
is received (I) within one year from the Closing Date or (II) or one year or
more after the Closing Date and the amount of the Escrow Fund (x) immediately
following the distribution required by Section 2(b) of the Escrow Agreement and
(y) on the date of such receipt is less than $5,000,000, or (B) to the
Disbursement Agent together with an amount equal to 38% of the portion of the
Contribution Amount to be paid, pursuant to the Phantom Stock Plan and/or the
Company's value creation pool, to the beneficiaries thereof as calculated by the
Representatives, which portion shall in no event shall exceed 12.5% of the
aggregate Contribution Amount, for distribution to the Common Stockholders and
the Unit Holders pursuant to the Disbursement Agent Agreement, if such payment
is not required to be deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to clause (A) above,
an amount (the "Contribution Amount") equal to the aggregate payments made to
the Parent Party, in respect of such claim, plus costs and expenses incurred in
investigating, defending or otherwise incurred in connection with addressing
such claim and (ii) the balance, if any, to the Parent Party.

         9.6      Indemnification by Parent. Parent hereby agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Common Stockholders, and shall reimburse the
Common Stockholders for, from and against Losses directly or indirectly relating
to, resulting from or arising out of any untrue representation,
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or nonfulfillment of any covenant,
agreement or other obligation by Parent or Acquisition Sub contained herein or
in any certificate, document or instrument delivered to the Company pursuant
hereto.

         9.7      Time Limitation; Parent. If the Closing occurs, Parent shall
have no liability with respect to any representation or warranty or covenant or
obligation to be performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date, unless
on or before that date which is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, the
Common Stockholders notify Parent of a Loss specifying the factual basis of that
Loss in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the Common Stockholders.

         9.8      Limitation on Amount; Parent. Parent shall be liable to the
Common Stockholders with respect to the matters described in 9.6 in an amount
not exceeding $5,000,000, for any Losses sustained by the Common Stockholders;
provided that there shall not be any reimbursement obligations under Section 9.6
until the Common Stockholders have suffered


                                       41
<PAGE>   48

aggregate Losses under Section 9.6 in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000) (the "Parent Loss Threshold"). Once the Common Stockholders
aggregate Losses exceed the Parent Loss Threshold, the Parent shall reimburse
the Common Stockholders for all Losses in excess of the Parent Loss Threshold.

         9.9      Procedure. The Parent Parties, on the one hand, or the
Representatives, on the other hand, seeking reimbursement or indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.1 or 9.6, as the case may be (the "Initiating Party"),
shall promptly notify the Representative or the Parent, as the case may be (the
"Receiving Party"), of any claim, demand, action or proceeding for which
reimbursement or indemnification will be sought under Sections 9.1 or 9.6 of
this Agreement, and, if such claim, demand, action or proceeding is a
third-party claim, demand, action or proceeding, the Receiving Party will have
the right (except with respect to any audit, administrative appeal or other
claim, demand, action or proceeding relating to Taxes, which shall be under the
control of Parent, at its option, subject to the last sentence of this Section
9.9) at its expense to assume the defense thereof using counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Initiating Party. The Initiating Party shall have the right to
participate, at its own expense, with respect to any such third-party claim,
demand, action or proceeding. In connection with any such third-party claim,
demand, action or proceeding, Parent and the Representatives shall cooperate
with each other and provide each other with access to relevant books and records
in their possession. No such third-party claim, demand, action or proceeding
shall be settled without the prior written consent of the Initiating Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If a firm written offer is made to
settle any such third-party claim, demand, action or proceeding and the
Receiving Party proposes to accept such settlement and the Initiating Party
refuses to consent to such settlement, then: (i) the Receiving Party shall be
excused from, and the Initiating Party shall be solely responsible for, all
further defense of such third-party claim, demand, action or proceeding and all
of the costs and expenses associated therewith; and (ii) the maximum obligation
of the Receiving Party to reimburse from the Escrow Fund or indemnify the
Initiating Party relating to such third-party claim, demand, action or
proceeding shall be the amount of the proposed settlement if the amount
thereafter recovered from the Initiating Party on such third party claim,
demand, action or proceeding is greater than the amount of the proposed
settlement. In the case of any audit, administrative appeal or other claim,
demand, action or proceeding relating to Taxes in connection with which the
Parent Parties are seeking reimbursement or indemnification pursuant to Section
9.1, if Parent elects to retain control of such audit or other proceeding as
permitted above, Parent shall permit the Representative to participate in the
defense thereof at its expense, and Parent shall not settle or otherwise
compromise such audit, administrative appeal, claim, demand, action or other
proceeding without the consent of the Representative unless settlement or
compromise would result in no reimbursement from the Escrow Fund.

         9.10     Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties by the parties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing for a period of one year, except that the representations
and warranties made in Sections 3.11 and 3.17 shall survive the Closing for four
(4) years.

         9.11     Common Stockholders' Representatives. Each Common Stockholder,
as a result of the approval of this Agreement by the requisite number of Common

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the remedy
at law for any breach of the provisions of this Section 9.11 would be
inadequate, (c) any Common Stockholder shall be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages if such
Common Stockholder brings an action to enforce the provisions of this Section
9.11, (d) the provisions of this Section 9.11 shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of each Common Stockholder and (e) any references in this
Agreement to a Common Stockholder or the Common Stockholders shall mean and
include the successor to the Common Stockholders' rights hereunder. In addition,
by their approval of this Agreement, the Common Stockholders shall be deemed to
have waived any claims they may have or assert, including those that may arise
in the future, against either of the Representatives for any action or inaction
taken or not taken by such Representatives in connection with such persons'
capacity as Representatives except to the extent that such action or inaction
shall have been held by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent, Parent and the Company are
hereby relieved from any liability for any acts done by them (except for acts
constituting fraud or negligence) in accordance with any resolution, action,
decision or instruction of the Representatives.

creation pool, to the beneficiaries thereof as calculated by the
