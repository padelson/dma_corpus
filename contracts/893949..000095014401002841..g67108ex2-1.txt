right of holders of Company Capital Stock to dissent from the Merger and require
appraisal of their shares of Company Capital Stock) will be converted into
shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of Parent ("Parent Common

                  WHEREAS no shares of Company Series B Stock or Company
Non-Voting Common Stock are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement;

                  WHEREAS Parent and each of Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe

<PAGE>   6


Effective Time (as defined hereinafter) in accordance with Section 4 of the
Stockholders' Agreement;

                  WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent,
Sub and the Company have determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and
consistent with their respective long-term business strategies and is in the
best interest of their respective stockholders or shareholders, as the case may
be; and

                  WHEREAS for federal income tax purposes, the parties to this
Agreement intend that the Merger shall be treated as a tax-free reorganization
under the provisions of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code").

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein set forth, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

                  Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, and in accordance with the DGCL, Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.2). Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of
Sub in accordance with the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, at the election of Parent, Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary (as
defined in Section 2.1) of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent
corporation in the Merger. In such event, the parties hereto agree to execute an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company, in order to reflect such substitution.

                  Section 1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective
when a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), prepared and
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that, upon
mutual consent of the Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of Merger may
provide for a later date of effectiveness of the Merger not more than 30 days
after the date the Certificate of Merger is filed. When used in this Agreement,
the term "Effective Time" shall mean the date and time at which the Certificate
of Merger is accepted for record or such later time established by the
Certificate of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made on
the date of the Closing (as defined in Section 1.16).

                  Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the DGCL, including Section 259(a) thereof.

                  Section 1.4 Charter and By-laws; Directors. (a) At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law (as defined in Section 2.4); provided,
however, that, subject to Section 5.15, the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub
shall include provisions substantially similar to ARTICLE NINTH of the
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the


                                       2
<PAGE>   7


Company existing on the date of this Agreement; provided, further, that, at the
Effective Time, ARTICLE FIRST of the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub shall
be amended to read in its entirety as follows: "The name of the corporation is
`Magella Healthcare Corporation'." At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation; provided,
however, that, subject to Section 5.15, the Bylaws of Sub shall include
provisions substantially similar to Article V of the Bylaws of the Company
existing on the date of this Agreement.

                  (b)      The directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be.

                  Section 1.5 Conversion of Securities. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the
Company or the holders of any securities of the Constituent Corporations:

                  (a)      Each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
$.01 par value per share, of Sub shall be converted into one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

                  (b)      All shares of Company Capital Stock that are held in
the treasury of the Company and shares of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent
or Sub or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company shall be
cancelled and no cash, capital stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

                  (c)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 1.9 and 1.11
hereof, each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 1.5(b) and (ii) the Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.6))
shall be converted into the right to receive from the Exchange Agent (as defined
in Section 1.7) a fraction (the "Exchange Ratio") of a validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x)
one-thirteenth times (y) (A) in the case of Company Common Stock, one, or (B) in
the case of any other class or series of Company Capital Stock, that number of
shares of Company Common Stock into which one share of such other class or
series of Company Capital Stock is then convertible. Holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger shall also receive for each share of Parent
Common Stock so issued a purchase right for one share of Parent Series A Stock
(as defined in Section 2.2), as provided in that certain Rights Agreement dated
as of March 31, 1999 by and between Parent and BankBoston, N.A. (the "Rights
Agreement"). All such shares of Company Capital Stock, when so converted, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive (i) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section
1.8, (ii) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which
such shares are converted and (iii) any cash, without interest, in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Sections 1.7
and 1.9.

                  Section 1.6 Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by stockholders who object to the Merger and who shall have complied with all
the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal for such shares
in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the consideration set forth in
Section 1.5(c). Such stockholders shall instead be entitled to receive such
consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares
held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under the DGCL
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
consideration set forth in Section 1.5(c), without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.7, of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares.

                  (b)      The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

                  Section 1.7 Parent to Make Certificates Available.

                  (a)      Exchange of Certificates. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall authorize a commercial bank (or such other person as shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) to act as the Exchange Agent
hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock converted in the Merger, certificates
representing the Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock and thereafter, from time to time promptly upon the
request of the Exchange Agent, cash or other property required, if any, to pay
or make any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 1.8 and cash required
to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.9 (such
Parent Common Stock, cash and other property being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest or other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon its request.
The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Parent Common Stock contemplated to be
issued and cash or other property distributable pursuant to Section 1.8 out of
the Exchange Fund.

                  (b)      Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each record holder of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock converted in the Merger
(the "Certificates"), a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall
contain instructions for use in effecting the


                                       4
<PAGE>   9


surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Parent
Common Stock and cash or other property distributable pursuant to Sections 1.8
and 1.9). Upon surrender for cancellation to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into
which the shares represented by the surrendered Certificate shall have been
converted at the Effective Time pursuant to this Article I, any dividends or
other distributions in accordance with Section 1.8 and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.9, and any
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

                  (c)      Certificates Delivered at Closing. Notwithstanding
anything else contained in this Section 1.7, Parent agrees to deliver at Closing
to each stockholder who shall have surrendered to Parent at least ten days prior
to Closing such stockholder's Certificates and a duly executed letter of
transmittal as described in paragraph (b) above, certificates representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares represented
by the surrendered Certificates shall have been converted at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Article I, any dividends or other distributions in accordance
with Section 1.8 and, as promptly thereafter as practicable, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.9, and any
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

                  Section 1.8 Dividends; Transfer Taxes; Withholding. No
dividends or other distributions that are declared on or after the Effective
Time on the Parent Common Stock, or are payable to the holders of record thereof
on or after the Effective Time, will be paid to any person entitled by reason of
the Merger to receive a certificate representing Parent Common Stock until such
person surrenders the related Certificate or Certificates, as provided in
Section 1.7, and no cash payment pursuant to Section 1.9 will be paid to any
such person until such person shall so surrender the related Certificate or
Certificates. Subject to the effect of applicable Law, there shall be paid to
each record holder of a new certificate representing such Parent Common Stock:
(i) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the
amount, if any, of any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with
respect to the Parent Common Stock represented by such new certificate and
having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to
such surrender; (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the amount, if any, of any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such Parent Common Stock and having a
record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date on or subsequent to such surrender; and (iii) at the time of such
surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any cash to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.9. In no event shall the
person entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions or cash be
entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other distributions or cash.
If any certificate representing Parent Common Stock or cash or other property is
to be issued or delivered in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such
exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax (as defined
in Section 2.8) required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such
Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold


                                       5
<PAGE>   10


from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Capital Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

                  Section 1.9 No Fractional Securities. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this Article I, and no Parent
dividend or other distribution or stock split shall relate to any fractional
share, and no fractional share shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
other rights of a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional
share, each holder of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of
Certificates for exchange pursuant to this Article I will be paid an amount in
cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying
(i) the average of the per share closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (the "NYSE") of a share of Parent Common Stock (as reported in the NYSE
Composite Transactions) during the five consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the
fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid
to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall
cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share
interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 1.7, Section
1.8 and this Section 1.9. For purposes of paying such cash in lieu of fractional
shares, all Certificates surrendered for exchange by a Company stockholder shall
be aggregated, and no such Company stockholder will receive cash in lieu of
fractional shares in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full
share of Parent Common Stock with respect to such Certificates surrendered.

                  Section 1.10 Return of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the
Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent and
any such former stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this Article
I shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent
Common Stock, any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.9 and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Company Capital
Stock for any such shares of Parent Common Stock, cash and dividends and
distributions held in the Exchange Fund which is delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

                  Section 1.11 Adjustment of Exchange Ratio. In the event that,
prior to the Effective Time, Parent effects any reclassification, stock split or
stock dividend with respect to Parent Common Stock, any change or conversion of
Parent Common Stock into other securities or any other dividend or distribution
with respect to the Parent Common Stock, appropriate and proportionate
adjustments, if any, shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, and all references to
the Exchange Ratio in this Agreement shall be deemed to be to the Exchange Ratio
as so adjusted.

                  Section 1.12 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital
Stock. All Parent Common Stock and cash issued or paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
or other property paid pursuant to Sections 1.8 and 1.9) shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificates.

                  Section 1.13 Closing of Company Transfer Books. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no
transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or the Parent, such
Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

                  Section 1.14 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Parent Common Stock, any cash payable pursuant to
Section 1.9 to which the holders thereof are entitled and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8.

                  Section 1.15 Further Assurances. If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of
either of the Constituent Corporations, or (ii) otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers
and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on
behalf of either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and things as may
be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving
Corporation's right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such Constituent
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

                  Section 1.16 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") and all actions contemplated by this Agreement to occur at the
Closing shall take place at the offices of Sidley & Austin, 875 Third Avenue,
New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which (subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI) shall be no later than the second business day following the day on
which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions required to be fulfilled on the date of the Closing) shall have been
fulfilled or waived, or at such other time and place as Parent and the Company
shall agree.

                                   ARTICLE II
                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB

                  Each of Parent and Sub jointly and severally represents and
warrants to the Company as follows:

                  Section 2.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Parent
and Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted.
Each Subsidiary of Parent is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the
requisite corporate (in the case of a Subsidiary that is a corporation) or other
power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except
where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have
such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and
could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect (as
hereinafter defined) on Parent. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are duly
qualified to do business, and are in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of their properties owned or held under lease or the nature of
their activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. For all
purposes of this Agreement, any reference to any state of facts, event, change
or effect having a "Material Adverse Effect" on or with respect to Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, means that such state of facts, event, change or
effect (i) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse
effect on the business, assets or properties, results of operations, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may
be, (ii) has or could reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to perform its respective obligations
hereunder, or (iii) has or could reasonably be expected to prevent the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,
that any increase or decrease in the trading price of Parent Common Stock shall
neither be considered in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
has occurred nor create any presumption that a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
has (or has not) occurred or will (or will not) occur; provided, further, that
any state of facts, event change or effect having a material adverse effect
generally on the physician practice management industry, similarly affecting
both Parent and the Company, shall neither be considered a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or create any presumption
that a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or the Company, as the case may be, has
occurred or will occur. For all purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" means
any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
professional or medical corporation, association, partnership or other entity of
which Parent or the Company, as the case may be (either alone or through or
together with any other Subsidiary), (i) owns, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the stock or other equity interests the holders of which are generally
entitled to vote for the election of the board of directors or other governing
body of such corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture
or other legal entity, (ii) is a general partner, trustee or other entity
performing similar functions or (iii) has control (as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act")).

       Section 2.2 Capital Structure. At the date hereof, the authorized capital
stock of Parent consists of 50,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share ("Parent Preferred
Stock"), of which 50,000 shares have been designated as "Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock" ("Parent Series A Stock"). At the close of
business on December 31, 2000, 15,877,815 shares of Parent Common Stock and no
shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding and, since such
date, Parent has not issued any such shares other than in connection with the
exercise of Parent Stock Options (as defined below). The capital stock of Sub
consists of 1,000 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, all of which
as of the date of this Agreement were issued and outstanding, and owned directly
by Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent had no shares of Parent
Common Stock reserved for issuance, except for shares of Parent Common Stock
reserved for issuance pursuant to Parent's Amended and Restated Stock Option
Plan (the "Parent Stock Plan"). Except as set forth above, at the close of
business on December 31, 2000, no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of Parent were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. All shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in exchange for Company Capital Stock at the Effective Time in
accordance with this Agreement will be, when so issued, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of the
date of this Agreement, except for (i) this Agreement, (ii) stock options issued
pursuant to the Parent Stock Plan (collectively, the "Parent Stock Options"),
and (iii) the rights to purchase shares of Parent Series A Stock issued pursuant
to the Rights Agreement, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights or
agreements to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of them is bound obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver
or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call,
right or agreement. Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary
of Parent that is a corporation is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents (as defined
in Section 2.6) filed prior to the date of this Agreement, all the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other ownership interests of each Subsidiary of
Parent are owned by Parent, another Subsidiary of Parent and/or a physician
under contract with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, mortgages, options, rights of first
refusal, agreements, limitations on voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever (each, a "Lien"), other than, in the case
of shares or other ownership interests of Subsidiaries held by physicians under
contract with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Liens in favor of Parent or its
Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have outstanding
any bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Parent having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matter on which shareholders of Parent may vote. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in
Section 2.2 of the letter dated the date hereof and delivered on the date hereof
by Parent to the Company, which letter relates to this Agreement and is
designated therein as the Parent Letter (the "Parent Letter"), Exhibit 21.1 to
the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Parent for the year ended December 31, 1999
(the "Parent Annual Report"), as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), is a true, accurate and correct statement in all
material


                                       9
<PAGE>   14


respects of all the information required to be set forth therein by the rules
and regulations of the SEC.

                  Section 2.3 Authority. The Boards of Directors of Parent and
Sub have duly approved (i) this Agreement, Stockholders' Agreement, the form of
Standstill and Registration Rights Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Standstill and Registration Rights Agreement"; together with this Agreement and
the Stockholders' Agreement, the "Transaction Documents"), the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the execution and delivery by
each of Parent and Sub of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The
Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub have declared the Merger advisable and in
the best interest of their respective stockholders or shareholders, as the case
may be. The Board of Directors of Parent has resolved to recommend the approval
by its shareholders of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with
the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement (the "Share Issuance"). Each of
Parent and Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and, subject to
approval by the shareholders of Parent of the Share Issuance, to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Board of
Directors of Sub has recommended this Agreement to its sole stockholder, and the
sole stockholder of Sub has approved this Agreement, all such actions being
taken in accordance with the DGCL. Except for the approval by the shareholders
of Parent of the Share Issuance, no further action by or vote of the
shareholders of Parent is required by applicable Law, the Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Parent or
otherwise in order for Parent or Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The performance by each of Parent and Sub of
its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation by each of Parent and Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub, subject to approval by the
shareholders of Parent of the Share Issuance and to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger as required by Sections 251(c) of the DGCL. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and (assuming the
valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the validity and binding effect of this Agreement on the Company) constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub enforceable against each of
them in accordance with its terms. The Standstill and Registration Rights
Agreement upon execution and delivery by each of Parent and the other parties
thereto (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of such
agreement by the other parties thereto and the validity and binding effect of
such agreement on such other parties thereto) will constitute a valid and
binding obligation of Parent enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms. The Share Issuance and the filing of a registration statement on Form S-4
with the SEC by Parent under the Securities Act for the purpose of registering
some or all of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Merger as contemplated by this Agreement (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, whether prior to or after the effective date thereof, the
"Registration Statement") have been duly authorized by Parent's Board of
Directors.

                  Section 2.4 No Violation. Assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations and other actions described in this Section 2.4 and
Section 2.5 have been obtained and all filings and obligations described in this
Section 2.4 and Section 2.5 have been made or satisfied, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement do not, the execution and delivery of the Standstill
and


                                       10

Registration Rights Agreement will not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance with the provisions hereof and
thereof will not, result in any violation of, or default or loss of a material
benefit (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give to
others a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties, assets
or operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i)
the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated
By Laws of Parent, (ii) the comparable charter or organization documents of any
Subsidiary of Parent, (iii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, instrument, permit, deed of trust, license, lease, contract,
commitment, or other agreement applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or (iv) any judgment, order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent),
notice, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation (collectively,
"Law") applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties, assets or operations, other than, in the case of clauses
(ii), (iii) or (iv), any such violations, defaults, losses, rights or Liens
that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and could not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or has not resulted, and
could not reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of any Lien on any
material properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  Section 2.5 No Filings, Consents or Approvals. No filing or
registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, (x) any domestic
(federal or state), foreign or supranational court, administrative agency or
commission, or other governmental or regulatory body, agency, authority or
tribunal (a "Governmental Entity") or (y) any third person under any loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license applicable to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is required by or with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Standstill and Registration Rights Agreement by Parent or Sub or is
necessary for the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Standstill and Registration Rights
Agreement, except (i) in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange
Act"), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities
of other states in which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business, (iii) applicable requirements, if any, of state securities or "blue
sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws") and the NYSE, (iv) the approval by the shareholders
of Parent of the Share Issuance, (v) as set forth in Section 2.5 of the Parent
Letter, and (vi) such other consents, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings the failure of which to be obtained or made,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and could not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or has not resulted, and
could not reasonably be expect to result, in the imposition of any Lien on any
material properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

except (i) such as are disclosed in Section 3.11 of the Company Letter, (ii)
mechanics', carriers', workmen's, landlords', repairmen's or other like
statutory Liens arising from or incurred in the ordinary course of business for

                  Each agreement, contract, lease, license, commitment or
instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets are bound (collectively, the
"Contracts") is valid, binding and in full force and effect. The Company or one
or more of its Subsidiaries has performed all material obligations required to
be performed by it to date under the Contracts and is not (with or without the
lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any
material respect thereunder and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no other party
to any of the Contracts is (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of
notice, or both) in breach or default in any material respect thereunder.

                  Section 3.15 Compliance with Applicable Laws. The Company and
each of its affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and all physicians
under contract with the Company or its Subsidiaries, are in compliance in all
material respects with all Laws applicable to the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, including Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. No notice, citation,

Subsidiaries and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any notice that (i) no complaint has been filed, (ii) any penalty has been
assessed or (iii) any investigation or review is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any alleged violation by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of any Law.

                  Section 3.16 Environmental Matters. The Company has obtained
all permits, licenses and other authorizations and filed all notices which are
required to be obtained or filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
all applicable Laws that are related to pollution, protection of the environment
or the generation or disposal of waste, except where the failure to obtain such
permit, license or other authorization, or file such notices, individually or in
the aggregate has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is in compliance in all material respects with all terms and conditions of such
required permits, licenses and authorizations. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all other applicable
limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements,
obligations, schedules and timetables contained in such Laws. There are no past
or present events, conditions, circumstances, activities, practices, incidents,
actions or plans which may interfere with or prevent continued compliance in all
material respects, or which may give rise to any material common law or
statutory liability or otherwise form the basis of any material claim, action,
suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation, based on or related to the
manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport, or handling, or the emission, discharge, release or threatened
release into the environment, or any pollutant, contaminant, or hazardous or
toxic material or waste (including biohazardous and medical waste) with respect
to or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

and correct and in compliance in all material


                                       24
<PAGE>   29


respects with all applicable Laws and the policies of all such third party
payors, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has billed for or
received any material payment or reimbursement in excess of amounts allowed by
applicable Law. None of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and their
respective officers, directors, employees and affiliates and persons and
entities providing professional services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in any activities which are prohibited under 42 U.S.C.
ss.ss. 1320a-7b and 1395nn, the regulations in 42 CFR ss. 1001 et seq., or any

application for any benefit or payment, (ii) making or causing to be made any
false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining
rights to any benefit or payment, (iii) soliciting or receiving any

                  Section 3.18 Certain Transactions and Interests. (a) Neither
the Company nor any of its affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers or
employees, nor any physician under contract with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is a party to any contract, lease, agreement or arrangement,
including any joint venture or consulting agreement, with any physician,
hospital, nursing facility, home health agency or other person who is in a
position to make or influence referrals to or otherwise generate business for
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide services, lease space, lease
equipment or engage in any other venture or activity.

                  Section 3.19 Inspections and Investigations. Neither the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' rights nor the right of any licensed
professional or other individual employed by or under contract with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to receive Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE
reimbursements has been terminated or otherwise adversely affected as a result
of any investigation or action by any Governmental Entity. None of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries nor any licensed professional or other individual
employed by or under contract with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has,
during the past three years, been the subject of


                                       25
<PAGE>   30


any inspection, investigation, survey, audit or monitoring by any Governmental
Entity, trade association, professional review organization, accrediting
organization or certifying agency, nor has any such individual received from any
such entity any notice of deficiency in connection with the operation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No licensed professional employed by or
under contract with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been the subject
of a "medical malpractice action or claim" or a "professional review action"
within the last three years as those terms are defined in the Health Care
Quality Improvement Act of 1986, as amended. There has been no inspection,
investigation, survey, audit, monitoring or other form of review to which any of
the foregoing has been subject.

the rights of the other regarding such names and (iii) is not aware of any

litigation, or legal, governmental, administrative or arbitration proceedings or
investigations, including appeals and applications for review, of which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or involving or otherwise affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their directors,
officers, affiliates, agents or employees, or any physician under contract with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in their capacity as such), or any of
its or their properties, assets or business, or relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. There are no outstanding orders, judgments,
injunctions, consents, agreements, awards or decrees of any Governmental Entity
against, involving or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or

affiliates, agents or employees, or any physician under contract with the

collectively, the "Benefit Plans") maintained by, or covering any employee of or
physician under contract with, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Except as

                  (b)      The Company has delivered to Parent, with respect to
each Benefit Plan set forth in Section 3.22(a) of the Company Letter, correct

Company Letter that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that
such Benefit Plan is so qualified under the Code and no circumstance exists
which might cause such Benefit Plan to cease being so qualified. Each Benefit
Plan set forth in Section 3.22(a) of the Company Letter complies and has been
maintained in all respects with its terms and all requirements of applicable
Law, and there has been no notice issued by any Governmental Entity questioning
or challenging such compliance. There are no actions, suits or claims (other
than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened involving such Benefit Plans or the assets of such Benefit Plans. The
Company does not have any obligations under any "welfare plans" or otherwise to
provide health or death benefits to or in respect of former employees or
physicians of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as specifically required
by the continuation requirements of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA. The Company does
not maintain any "pension plan" which, if terminated on the date of the Closing,
would impose any liability on the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company has
no liability of any kind whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, contingent or
otherwise, on account of (i) any violation of the health care requirements of
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, (ii) under Section
502(i) or Section 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) under
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (iv) under Title IV of ERISA.

                  (e)      Section 3.22(e) of the Company Letter sets forth a
true and complete list of each agreement, commitment, understanding, plan,
policy or arrangement of any kind, whether or not in writing, with or for the
benefit of any current or former officer, director or employee of, or any

         Section 4.2       Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Closing.
During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain its existence and

the same manner has heretofore conducted and, to the extent consistent
therewith, use all reasonable efforts to keep available the services of its
current officers and employees and preserve its relationships with physicians,
customers, suppliers, licensers, lessor, third party payors and others having
business dealings with it. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Parent
Letter or as specifically permitted by any other provision of this Agreement,
Parent shall not (unless required by applicable Law or stock exchange
regulations), between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
directly or indirectly, do, or agree to do, any of the following, without the
prior written consent of the Company, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld:

         (a)      amend or otherwise change Parent's Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws in a manner that
adversely affects the rights of holders of Parent Common Stock;

         (b)      amend or otherwise change Sub's Certificate of Incorporation

<PAGE>   37

that is not so qualified untrue or incorrect in any material respect or (z)
result in any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI not being
satisfied or in the consummation of the Merger being materially delayed.

         Section 4.3       Third Party Confidentiality Agreements. During the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality
or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
(other than any involving Parent). During such period, the Company agrees to
enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of
any such agreements, including obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in
any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

         Section 4.4       No Solicitation. (a) The Company shall not, nor shall
it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any
officer, director, employee or stockholder of or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its best efforts to cause the
foregoing persons not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or
encourage the submission of, any takeover proposal (as defined below), (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any takeover proposal or (iii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any takeover proposal; provided, however, that prior to
the Company Stockholders' Approval Date (as defined in Section 5.1), to the
extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested members
thereof based on the advice of outside counsel, the Company may, in response to
unsolicited requests therefor, participate in discussions or negotiations with,
or furnish information pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to,
any person. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any officer,
director, employee or stockholder of or any investment banker, attorney,
accountant, agent or other advisor or representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this paragraph by
the Company. For all purposes of this Agreement, "takeover proposal" means any
proposal, other than a proposal by Parent for a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or other similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer (including, without
limitation, any proposal or offer to stockholders of the Company), other than a
proposal or offer by Parent, to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly,
an equity interest in, any voting securities of, or a substantial portion of the
assets of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company immediately shall
cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with
any persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any takeover proposal. The Company will take the necessary
steps to inform the persons referred to in this Section 4.4 of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 4.4.

         (b)      Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the approval or recommendation by
the Board of Directors of the Company or any such


                                       33
<PAGE>   38

committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, any other takeover proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company, to the extent required by
the fiduciary obligations thereof, as determined in good faith by a majority of
the disinterested members thereof based on the advice of outside counsel, may
approve or recommend (and, in connection therewith, withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger) a superior proposal
(as defined below). For all purposes of this Agreement, "superior proposal"
means a bona fide written proposal made by a third party to acquire the Company
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a share exchange, a sale of
all or substantially all its assets or otherwise on terms which a majority of
the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
their good faith judgment (based on the opinion, with only customary
qualifications, of independent financial advisors that the value of the
consideration provided for in such proposal exceeds the value of the
consideration provided for in the Merger) to be more favorable to the Company
and its stockholders than the Merger, for which financing, to the extent
required, is then fully committed or which, in the good faith judgment of a
majority of such disinterested members (based on the advice of independent
financial advisors), is reasonably capable of being financed by such third
party, and which is reasonable capable of being consummated without undue delay.

         (c)      The Company shall immediately advise Parent orally and in
writing of any takeover proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to any takeover proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such takeover proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person
making any such takeover proposal or inquiry. The Company will keep Parent fully
informed of the status and details of any such takeover proposal or inquiry.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         Section 5.1       Parent Shareholders Meetings; Stockholders' Consent.
(a) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, a meeting of its shareholders (the
"Parent Shareholders' Meeting") for the purpose of considering the Share
Issuance. Parent will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its
shareholders approval of such matter and shall not withdraw or modify such
recommendation except to the extent that the Board of Directors of Parent shall
have determined that its fiduciary duties require it to do so (it being
understood that any increase after the date hereof in the trading price of
Parent Common Stock shall not in and of itself constitute sufficient reason for
the Board of Directors of Parent to withdraw or modify such recommendation).

         (b)      Commencing on the first business day following the date on
which the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, the Company
shall solicit a written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Stockholders' Consent"), from each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock and from each holder of shares of Company Series
A Stock pursuant to Section 228(e) of the DGCL and the Bylaws of the Company
with a view to obtaining the Required Company Stockholders' Approval as promptly
as practicable. Promptly following the date on which the Required Company
Stockholders' Approval is obtained, the Company shall prepare and mail to all
its stockholders the notice of action authorized by the Stockholders' Consent
(the "Notice of


                                       34
<PAGE>   39

Stockholders' Action"). The Company will, through its Board of Directors,
recommend to its stockholders approval of the matters set forth in the
Stockholders' Consent and shall not withdraw or modify such recommendation
except to the extent permitted by Section 4.4(b). Parent shall have the right
and opportunity to review and make reasonable comments on any materials
distributed to stockholders in connection with the foregoing (including the
Stockholders' Consent and the Notice of Stockholders' Action) prior to the
distribution thereof and the Company shall not unreasonably refuse to include
such comments of Parent.

         Section 5.2       Filings; Other Actions. (a) Parent shall promptly
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement in which the Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus. Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement cover all the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and be declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. As promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become effective, Parent
shall mail the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Parent shall also take any
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which they
are currently not so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the Share Issuance. The Company shall
promptly furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of
Company Capital Stock as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement, including information
relating to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock required or permitted to
be registered. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event with respect
to Parent, its officers and directors or any of its Subsidiaries shall occur
that is required to be described in the Proxy Statement, such event shall be so
described, and an appropriate amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, as required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
shareholders of Parent. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event
with respect to Parent, its officers and directors or any of its Subsidiaries
shall occur that is required to be described in the Registration Statement, such
event shall be so described, and an appropriate amendment or supplement shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company.

         (b)      Each of the Company and Parent will promptly furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submissions
necessary after the date hereof under the HSR Act. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent will promptly notify
the other of the receipt and content of any inquiries or requests for additional
information made by any Governmental Entity in connection therewith and will
promptly (i) subject to the proviso to Section 5.9(a), comply with any such
inquiry or request and (ii) provide the other with a description of the
information provided to any Governmental Entity with respect to any such inquiry
or request. In addition, each of the Company and Parent will keep the other
apprised of the status of any such inquiry or request.

         Section 5.3       Comfort Letters. The Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent "comfort" letters of Arthur Andersen
LLP, the Company's independent public accountants, dated the date on which the
Registration Statement shall become effective and as of the Effective Time, and
addressed to Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
reasonably customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by


                                       35

contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 5.4       Access to Information. (a) The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives of Parent reasonable access to, and
permit them to make such inspections as they may reasonably require of, during
normal business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Effective Time, all their respective properties, books, Tax Returns,
contracts, commitments and records (including the work papers of independent
accountants, if available and subject to the consent of such independent
accountants) and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. The
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
upon the request of Parent a copy of each report, schedule, registration,
application or other document filed by the Company with any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4(a)
shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party
hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. All
information obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the letter agreement dated September 13, 2000
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Parent and the Company.

         (b)      Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
afford to the accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
of the Company reasonable access to, and permit them to make such inspections as
they may reasonably require of, during normal business hours during the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, its properties,
books, Tax Returns, contracts, commitments and records (including the work
papers of independent accountants, if available and subject to the consent of
such independent accountants) and, during such period, Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the Company all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the Company may
reasonably request. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) shall
affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or
any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. All information obtained
by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

         Section 5.5       Compliance with the Securities Act. Within 30 days
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Parent a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Parent)
identifying all persons who in the Company's reasonable judgment may be deemed
to be "affiliates" of the Company as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d)
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). The Company
shall use its best efforts to cause each person who is identified as a Rule 145
Affiliate in such list to deliver to Parent on or prior to the Effective Time a
written agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Affiliate's Agreement"), executed by such person.

         Section 5.6       Stock Exchange Listings. Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to list on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the
Parent Common Stock to be issued in


                                       36

connection with the Merger and upon exercise of the Substitute Options (as
defined in Section 5.8).

         Section 5.7       Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in Sections
5.7(b) and (c), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

         (b)      Provided that the Company is not in material breach of its
representations, warranties or agreements set forth in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f),
or if the shareholders of Parent shall fail to approve the Share Issuance at the
Parent Shareholders' Meeting after the Board of Directors of Parent shall have
withdrawn or modified its recommendation of such transaction pursuant to Section
5.1(a), then Parent shall pay to the Company $4,500,000 (the "Termination Fee")
in same-day funds on the date of such termination or within two business days
following the date of the Parent Shareholders' Meeting, as applicable.

         (c)      If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(e), or if the shareholders of Parent shall fail to
approve the Share Issuance at the Parent Shareholders' Meeting and the Board of
Directors of Parent shall not have withdrawn or modified its recommendation of
such transaction pursuant to Section 5.1(a), then Parent shall pay to the
Company $1,500,000 in same-day funds on the date of such termination or within
two business days following the date of the Parent Shareholders' Meeting, as
applicable, as reimbursement for all fees and expenses incurred by the Company
in connection herewith.

         Section 5.8       Company Stock Options. (a) As of the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (other than any "stock purchase plan"
within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code) in effect on the date hereof or
granted hereafter in accordance with Section 4.1(h) shall be assumed by Parent
and become and represent an option to purchase the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (a "Substitute Option") (decreased to the nearest full share)
determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest tenth of a cent) equal to the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
the Exchange Ratio. Parent shall pay cash to holders of Company Stock Options in
lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock upon the exercise of
Substitute Options. As of the Effective Time, each Substitute Option shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to
the Effective Time under the related Company Stock Option and Company Stock Plan
under which it was granted; provided, however, that, with respect to the
Substitute Options granted to the individuals listed in Section 5.8 of the
Company Letter, such Substitute Options shall remain exercisable for the periods
specified in Section 5.8 of the Company Letter notwithstanding the occurrence of
the Merger or any termination of such individual's employment with the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The Company agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to obtain any


                                       37
<PAGE>   42

necessary consents of holders of Company Stock Options and take such other
actions as may be necessary to effect this Section 5.8.

         (b)      In respect of each Company Stock Option as converted into a
Substitute Option pursuant to Section 5.8(a) and assumed by Parent, and the
shares of Parent Common Stock underlying such option, at or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall file and keep current a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement on Form S-8)
or other appropriate form and shall keep such registration statement current and
effective for as long as such options remain outstanding.

         Section 5.9       Reasonable Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, subject to the rights of the Board
of Directors of each of Parent and the Company to withdraw or modify its
recommendation to its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, as set forth
in Section 5.1, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including: (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents and approvals from all Governmental Entities and the making of
all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity (including those in connection with the HSR Act and state
takeover statutes), (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or this Agreement vacated or
reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require Parent
to make any divestiture or consent to any divestiture of any assets, operations
or practices in order to effect the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or to appeal any injunction or order, or to post
a bond in respect of such appeal.

         (b)      The Company and Parent each shall use all reasonable efforts
not to take any action that, in any such case, might reasonably be expected to
(i) cause any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement
that is qualified as to materiality to be untrue, (ii) cause any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement that is not so
qualified to be untrue in any material respect, (iii) result in a breach of any
covenant made by it in this Agreement, (iv) result directly or indirectly in any
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or
(v) impair the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger at the earliest
practicable time (regardless of whether such action would otherwise be permitted
or not prohibited hereunder).

         Section 5.10      Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will not
issue any press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect to such
transactions without prior consultation with


                                       38
<PAGE>   43

each other party, except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

         Section 5.11      State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price", "business
combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall use all
reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise act
to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         Section 5.12      Notification of Certain Matters. Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to Parent, of: (i) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of which it is aware and which would be reasonably likely to cause (x) any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (y) any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in all material
respects, (ii) any failure of any of Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, (iii) any suit,
action or proceeding brought or threatened by any Governmental Entity or other
person, or before any Governmental Entity, against or in respect of such party

that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or the Company, as the case may be;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.12
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice. In addition, Parent shall notify and consult with
the Company reasonably in advance of the acquisition by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries of any properties, assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, involving consideration of $15,000,000 or more.

         Section 5.13      Employees. (a) Except as provided in Section 5.8, for
not less than one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, compensation and employee
benefits plans and arrangements for employees of and physicians under contract
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("Affected Employees") that are, in
the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided under the Company's
compensation arrangements and Company Plans as in effect on the date hereof.

         (b)      Parent will, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of
participant contributions and benefit accruals only, grant to all Affected
Employees as of the Closing credit under employee benefit plans and arrangements
currently maintained by Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which
such Affected Employees become eligible to participate ("Parent Plans") for all
their service with the Company prior to the Effective Time as if such service
had been rendered to Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries (but subject
to an offset, if necessary, to avoid duplication of benefits). With respect to
Affected Employees as of


                                       39
<PAGE>   44

the Effective Time, Parent will use all reasonable efforts to waive all
pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions under Parent Plans that provide
medical, dental, or vision benefits or coverage; provided, however, that no such
waiver will apply to a pre-existing condition of any employee of the Company
that was, as of the Effective Time, excluded from coverage in a similar benefit
plan of the Company. Furthermore, any covered expenses incurred during the
calendar year on or before the Effective Time by an Affected Employee (or a
covered family member thereof) under the Company Plans that provide medical,
dental, or vision benefits or coverage will be deemed to have been incurred as
covered expenses under the corresponding Parent Plans for purposes of satisfying
any applicable deductible, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximum provisions
under such Parent Plans for such calendar year.

         (c)      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any obligation on the part of
Parent to continue the employment of any Affected Employees for any definite
period following the Closing or (ii) preclude Parent from amending or
terminating any of the Parent Plans or the Company Plans following the Closing.

         (d)      No Affected Employee or other current or former employee of
the Company including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other person
not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim hereunder.

         Section 5.14      Certain Agreements. (a) At the Closing, Parent shall
execute and deliver, and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable Principal Stockholders to execute and deliver, the Standstill and
Registration Rights Agreement.

         (b)      The Company shall, and use its best efforts to cause the
respective parties thereto to, enter into a binding agreement to terminate,
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of (i) Section
1.05, Section 1.08 and Article VI of the Recapitalization Agreement dated
February 2, 1998, as amended, among Newborn and Pediatric Healthcare Associates,
P.A. and the several participants named in schedules I and II thereto, (ii) the
Registration Rights Agreement dated February 2, 1998, as amended, among the
Company and the stockholders party thereto, and (iii) the Stockholders Agreement
dated February 2, 1998, as amended, among the Company and the stockholders party
thereto.

         Section 5.15      Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.
(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions (including advancement of expenses, if so
provided) occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
provided by the Company in its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time
and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith shall be assumed by
Parent. Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, the Company's current directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy (including any fiduciary liability policy) that provides
coverage with respect to any claims made during the six-year period following
the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective Time that is
substantially similar to the Company's existing


                                       40
<PAGE>   45

policies or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage. The premium for such policy shall be paid in full at
the Effective Time.

         (b)      The provisions of this Section 5.15 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each person who is or has been a
director or officer of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, and such
director's or officer's heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent.

         Section 5.16      Appointment of Directors. Parent shall use its best
efforts to cause three vacancies to be created on its Board of Directors (by
increasing the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of Parent
or otherwise) and to cause John K. Carlyle, D. Scott Mackesy and Ian M. Ratner
to be appointed or elected to fill such vacancies at the Effective Time. If the
Parent Shareholders' Meeting is not Parent's annual meeting of shareholders for
2001, Parent also shall use its best efforts to cause Messrs. Carlyle, Mackesy
and Ratner to be nominated for election at such meeting and shall recommend the
election of such individuals to its shareholders and, regardless of whether the
Parent Shareholders Meeting is Parent's annual meeting of shareholders for 2001,
Parent shall use its best efforts to cause Messrs. Carlyle and Ratner to be
nominated for election to Parent's Board of Directors at Parent's annual meeting
of shareholders for 2002, in each case to serve for a term of at least one year.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to appoint or elect
to, or, if appointed or elected, shall be entitled to remove from, the Board of
Directors of Parent any person who has been convicted of any crime (other than a
traffic violation), who is the subject of credible allegations of moral
turpitude or who, in the reasonable judgment of the Board, is legally ineligible
to serve on the Board.

         Section 5.17      Cashless Exercise of the Warrants. The Company shall
treat the Warrants as set forth in the fourth recital to this Agreement and,
upon the exercise of Warrants by each holder thereof, shall issue to such holder
so exercising its Warrants prior to the Effective Time shares of Company
Non-Voting Stock, all in accordance with Section 4 of the Stockholders'
Agreement.

         Section 5.18      Amendment of Terms of Convertible Debt. The Company
shall, and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each holder of Convertible
Debt set forth in Section 3.2 of the Company Letter (each a "Convertible Debt
Holder") to, enter a binding agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent
prior to the Effective Time amending the terms of the Convertible Debt held by
such holder so as to provide that such holder shall receive, upon conversion of
such Convertible Debt and in lieu of shares of Company Common Stock, such
consideration as such holder would have received in accordance with Article I of
this Agreement if such Convertible Debt had been converted into shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         Section 5.19      Company Permits and Physician Permits. On or before
the thirtieth day after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to Parent and
Sub an amendment to Section 5.19 of the Company Letter which shall set forth a
true and complete list of all Permits.

set forth in Section 6.2(b) with respect to the Company or Section 6.3(b) with
respect to Parent, respectively, or (ii) a material breach of the covenants or
agreements on the part of the other set forth in this Agreement, in each case
which breach has not been cured within ten business days following receipt by
the breaching party of notice of such breach from the nonbreaching party;

         (c)      by either Parent or the Company if any permanent order,
decree, ruling or other action of a court or other competent authority
restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Merger
shall have become final and non-appealable;

         (d)      by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have
been consummated before July 31, 2001, unless the failure to consummate the
Merger is the result of a material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that the passage of such period
shall be tolled for any part thereof during which any party shall be subject to
a nonfinal order, decree, ruling or other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise preventing the consummation of Merger;

         (e)      by either Parent or the Company if any required approval of
the Share Issuance by the shareholders of Parent shall not have been obtained by
reason of the failure to


                                       45
<PAGE>   50

obtain the required vote upon a vote held at a duly held meeting of such
shareholders or at any adjournment thereof; or

         (f)      by either Parent or the Company if the Board of Directors of
Parent shall or shall resolve to withdraw or modify its recommendation to
Parent's shareholders of the Share Issuance as contemplated by Section 5.1(a).

         Section 7.2       Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either Parent or the Company, as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability hereunder
on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, or their respective officers or
directors, except for the last sentence of Section 5.4(a) and the entirety of
Sections 2.15 (Brokers), 3.27 (Brokers), and 5.7 (Fees and Expenses), this
Section 7.2, and Article VIII (all of which shall survive the termination);
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall relieve any
party hereto from any liability for any willful breach of a representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or the breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement.

         Section 7.3       Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto, by or pursuant to action taken by their respective Boards of
Directors at any time, whether before or after approval of any matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the shareholders or stockholders of Parent, Sub
or the Company but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by
applicable Law requires further approval by such shareholders or stockholders
without such further approval, and no amendment shall be made in violation of
Section 251(d) of the DGCL. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing duly executed by each of the parties hereto.

         Section 7.4       Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein which may legally be waived. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing duly executed by such party.
The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         Section 8.1       Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties.
Except for any claim arising as a result of any breach of a representation or
warranty prior to the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.2,
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the termination of this Agreement.

         Section 8.2       Notices. All notices, consents, waivers, approvals
and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and

         Section 8.3       Interpretation. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a Section or Article, such reference shall be to a Section or
Article of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". As used in
this Agreement, the term "person" means any individual, general partnership,
limited partnership, limited liability company, corporation, joint venture,
trust, business trust, cooperative or association or other legal entity or
organization, and the term "business day"


                                       47
<PAGE>   52

means any day other than a Saturday, or Sunday or any other day on which banks
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, or Dallas, Texas, are required or permitted to be
closed.

         Section 8.4       Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart.

         Section 8.5       Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement together with all other agreements executed by the parties hereto on
the date hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof (including
the letter agreement dated November 29, 2000, the letter agreement dated
December 15, 2000, as amended, and the non-binding letter of intent dated
January 29, 2001, each of which is between Parent and the Company). This
Agreement, except for the provisions of Sections 5.8 and 5.15, is not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

         Section 8.6       GOVERNING LAW. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DGCL
GOVERNS THE EFFECTS OF THE MERGER, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND EACH OF THE
COMPANY, PARENT AND SUB CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK AND THE FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO ENFORCE ANY PROVISION OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR TO DETERMINE THE RIGHTS OF ANY PARTY HERETO.

         Section 8.7       Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

         Section 8.8       Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

         Section 8.9       Enforcement of this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific wording or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, such
remedy being in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at
law or in equity.

                                     [Date]

Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.
1301 Concord Terrace
Sunrise, Florida 33323-2825
Attention: President



Ladies and Gentlemen:

         I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed
to be an "affiliate" of Magella Healthcare Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs
(c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and
Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), although nothing contained
herein shall be construed as an admission that I am in fact an "affiliate" of
the Company nor as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that
I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
February 14, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.,
a Florida corporation ("Parent"), Infant Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and the Company, Sub
will be merged with and into the Company and the Company will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, I may
receive shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of Parent (the "Parent
Shares"), in exchange for shares of capital stock of the Company (the "Company
Shares"), owned by me or purchasable upon exercise of stock options or warrants.
Capitalized terms used in this letter without definition shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

         I represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that if I receive any
Parent Shares as a result of the Merger:

         1.       I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
any Parent Shares in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

         2.       I have been advised that the issuance of the Parent Shares to
me pursuant to the Merger has been registered with the Commission under the Act
on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that
because (a) I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company and (b) the sale,
transfer or other distribution by me of the Parent Shares has not been
registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the
Parent Shares issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the conditions of Rule 145 promulgated by
the Commission under the


<PAGE>   59

Act (provided that I deliver to Parent customary letters of representation from
myself and my broker), (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been
registered under the Act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise
exempt from registration under the Act.

         3.       I understand and agree that[, except as provided in the
Standstill and Registration Rights Agreement to be entered into between myself,
Parent and certain others pursuant to the Merger Agreement,] Parent is under no
obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of any Parent
Shares by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary
in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

         4.       I also understand and agree that appropriate legends will be
placed on the certificates representing the Parent Shares issued to me in the
Merger, or any substitutions therefor, including:

         "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A
         TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
         1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE
         TRANSFERRED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED
         [  ], 2001 AMONG THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND PEDIATRIX MEDICAL
         GROUP, INC., A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL
         OFFICE OF PEDIATRIX MEDICAL GROUP, INC."

         5.       I also understand and agree that unless a sale, transfer or
other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, or
pursuant to a registration statement, Parent reserves the right to put the
following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

         "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON
         WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED
         UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD,
         TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF WITHOUT REGISTRATION
         UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION
         FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

         6.       I also understand that the legends referred to in paragraphs
4 and 5 above will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates promptly
following receipt of an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent from counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such
legends are no longer applicable.

         7.       I acknowledge that (i) I have carefully read this letter and
the Merger Agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and other
applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
the Parent Shares, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel
for the Company and (ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an inducement
and a condition to Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger.



                                             Very truly yours,

proxy or consent solicitation involving the election or removal of directors or
any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to
stockholders of the Company), not agreed to by the Company, for a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to acquire in any manner,

                                   ARTICLE V
                               REGISTRATION RIGHTS

                  SECTION 5.1.      Demand Registrations. (a) At any time after
the Lock-up Period, any one or more Investors holding at least 50% of the
Registrable Shares may request


                                       5
<PAGE>   66

registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their Registrable Shares
for sale in the manner specified in such request; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to register Registrable Shares pursuant to this
Section 5.1(a) on more than one occasion in the aggregate, or after the
additional take-down referred to in Section 5.3(d); provided further that the
Company shall not be obligated to register Registrable Shares pursuant to this
Section 5.1(a) (i) within one year after the effectiveness of any Piggyback
Registration in connection with which either the requesting Investors declined
to avail themselves of the opportunity to include their Registrable Shares
therein or at least 50% of the Registrable Shares they requested to be included
in such registration were so included, or (ii) until the expiration of the later
of (x) such one-year period and (y) the 90-day period commencing with such
request, if the Company delivers notice to the holders of Registrable Shares as
soon as practicable after any request hereunder that the Company in good faith
believes that it will offer Piggyback Registration to the Investors pursuant to
Section 5.2 within 90 days of such request. All registrations requested pursuant
to this Section 5.1(a) shall be referred to herein as "Demand Registrations".

                  (b)      A registration will not count as a Demand
Registration for purposes of the first proviso to Section 5.1(a) unless it has
become effective and the Investor or Investors requesting such registration are
able to register and sell at least 50% of the Registrable Shares they requested
to be included in such registration.

                  (c)      The Company and the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Shares to be sold pursuant to a Demand Registration shall, upon
mutual agreement, designate one or more managing underwriters of nationally
recognized standing, if applicable, for such offering. If the managing
underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of
Registrable Shares and other securities requested to be included (i) creates a
substantial risk that the price per share in such registration will be
materially and adversely affected or (ii) exceeds the number of Registrable
Shares and other securities that can be sold in such offering, then the Company
will include in such registration, prior to the inclusion of any securities that
are not Registrable Shares, the number of Registrable Shares requested to be
included (including requests pursuant to Section 5.2(a)) that, in the opinion of
such underwriters, can be sold, pro rata among the respective Investors, on the
basis of the number of Registrable Shares owned by such Investors so requested
to be included.

                  (d)      The Company may at its option postpone for up to 90
days the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for a Demand
Registration if the Company delivers to the Investors that have requested such
Demand Registration a certificate executed by an executive officer of the
Company to the effect that in the reasonable judgment of the Company such Demand
Registration, if effected, could materially interfere with or materially
adversely affect any then existing negotiations for financing or any other
agreement, arrangement, event, plan or transaction then intended, pending or
being negotiated in good faith (an "Adverse Event").

                  (e)      Independent of and without limiting the Company's
rights under Section 5.1(d), the Company may at its option also prohibit, for up
to 60 days, the use of a registration statement for a Demand Registration upon a
certificate executed by an executive officer of the Company to the effect that
such prohibition is required to prevent an Adverse Event.

                  SECTION 5.2.      Piggyback Rights. (a) Whenever the Company
proposes to register any Common Stock under the Securities Act (including,
without limitation, a Demand Registration) on a registration statement other
than Form S-4 or Form S-8 , the Company will give prompt written notice to all
Investors of its intention to effect such a registration (which notice shall be
given not less than (i) in the case of a Demand Registration, ten days after
receipt by the Company of a request therefor pursuant to Section 5.1(a) and (ii)
in all other cases, 15 days prior to the date the registration statement is to
be filed) and, subject to the terms hereof, will include in such registration (a
"Piggyback Registration") all Registrable Shares with respect to which the
Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within ten days
after the receipt of the Company's notice.

                  (b)      If a Piggyback Registration arises in connection with
a Demand Registration and the managing underwriters advise the Company in
writing that in their opinion the number of Registrable Shares and other
securities requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration (i) creates a
substantial risk that the price per share in such registration will be
materially and adversely affected or (ii) exceeds the number of Registrable
Shares and other securities that can be sold in such offering, then the Company
will include in such registration, prior to the inclusion of any securities that
are not Registrable Shares, the number of Registrable Shares requested to be
included (including the Registrable Shares requested to be included pursuant to
the Demand Registration) that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold,
pro rata among the respective Investors requesting to sell Registrable Shares as
set forth in Section 5.1(c).

                  (c)      If a Piggyback Registration arises that is not in
connection with a Demand Registration and the managing underwriters advise the
Company in writing that in their opinion the number of Registrable Shares and
other securities requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration (i)
creates a substantial risk that the price per share in such registration will be
materially and adversely affected or (ii) exceeds the number of Registrable
Shares and other securities that can be sold in such offering, then the Company
will include in such registration only: (x) first, any securities the Company
proposes to sell or is required to include under any agreement of the Company,
and (y) second, Registrable Shares requested to be included in such registration
to the extent that, in the opinion of such underwriters, they can be sold, pro
rata among the Investors holding Registrable Shares requested to be included on
the basis of the number of such shares owned by such Investors and requested to
be so registered.

                  SECTION 5.3.      Shelf Registration. (a) Unless the Excess
Shares have previously been registered for resale under the Registration
Statement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act, the Company shall within 30 days after the Closing file with the
Commission, and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be declared
effective within 90 days after the Closing, a shelf registration statement on
any appropriate form pursuant to Rule 415 for the sale by the WCAS Parties of
the Excess Shares (the Registration Statement, as amended, or such registration
statement, the "Shelf Registration"). Any sales pursuant to the Shelf
Registration shall be subject to Section 3.1(b).

                  (b)      The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to keep

                  (c)      The Company further agrees to supplement or make
amendments to the Shelf Registration, if required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the form utilized by the Company or by the Securities
Act.

                  (d)      The WCAS Parties shall have the right to require one
underwritten offering off the Shelf Registration Statement (a "take-down"), plus
an additional take-down that may be utilized in lieu of (and will be deemed to
be) the Demand Registration; provided, however, that any such take-down shall be
in respect of shares of Common Stock having a fair market value of not less than
$5,000,000 on the date such request is made.

                  SECTION 5.4.      Holdback Agreements. (a) Each Investor
agrees (and shall sign an agreement to such effect in the usual form of the
managing underwriters if the managing underwriters request such agreement), not
to effect any public sale or distribution of Common Stock, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock, or any hedging
or similar transactions, during the 15 days prior to and the 90-day period
beginning on the effective date of any underwritten Demand Registration or
underwritten Piggyback Registration (except as part of such underwritten
registration).

                  (b)      The Company agrees (and shall sign an agreement to
such effect in the usual form of the managing underwriters, if the managing
underwriters request such agreement) not to effect any public sale or
distribution of Common Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for Common Stock, during the 15 days prior to and the 90-day
period beginning on the effective date of any underwritten Demand Registration
(except as part of such underwritten registration).

                  SECTION 5.5.      Registration Procedures. (a) Whenever any
Investor has requested that any Registrable Shares be registered pursuant to
this Agreement, the Company will use all reasonable efforts promptly to effect
the registration and the sale of such Registrable Shares (subject to the
limitations in Sections 5.1(a), 5.1(c), 5.1(d), 5.1(e), 5.2(b) and 5.2(c)) in
accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto
the Company will use all reasonable efforts to:

                  (i)      prepare (and afford counsel for the selling Investors
         reasonable opportunity to review and comment on) and file with the
         Commission within 30 days (or if the Company shall not then be eligible
         to use Form S-3, 60 days) of the date of such request a registration
         statement with respect to such Registrable Shares and cause such
         registration statement to become and remain effective for such period
         as may be reasonably necessary to effect the sale of such securities as
         described in such request;

                  (ii)     prepare (and afford counsel for the selling Investors
         reasonable opportunity to review and comment on) and file with the
         Commission such amendments and supplements to such registration
         statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be
         necessary to keep such registration statement effective and comply with
         the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of
         all securities


                                       8
<PAGE>   69

         covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance
         with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set
         forth in such registration statement;

                  (iii)    furnish to each seller of Registrable Shares and the
         underwriters of the securities being registered such number of copies
         of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto,
         the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each
         preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as such seller or
         underwriters may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
         disposition of the Registrable Shares owned by such seller or the sale
         of such securities by such underwriters;

                  (iv)     register or qualify such Registrable Shares under
         such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions within the

         offering, the managing underwriter, reasonably requests and do any and
         all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary to enable
         such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the
         Registrable Shares owned by such seller; provided, however, that the
         Company will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in
         any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify
         but for this subsection or (B) consent to general service of process in
         any such jurisdiction;

                  (v)      cause all such Registrable Shares to be listed or
         authorized for quotation on each securities exchange or automated
         quotation system on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted or,
         if the Common Stock is not then so listed or quoted, as the Investors
         (acting through Investor Approval) may reasonably request;

                  (vi)     provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such
         Registrable Shares not later than the effective date of such
         registration statement;

                  (vii)    enter into such customary agreements (including
         underwriting agreements in customary form) and take all such other
         actions as the holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares being
         sold or the underwriters, if any, reasonably request in order to
         expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Shares;

                  (viii)   make available for inspection at a reasonable time by
         any seller of Registrable Shares, any underwriter participating in any
         disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney,
         accountant or other agent retained by any such seller or underwriter,
         all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and
         properties of the Company, and cause the Company's officers, directors,
         employees and independent accountants to supply all information
         reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney,
         accountant or agent in connection with the preparation of such
         registration statement;

                  (ix)     notify each seller of such Registrable Shares,
         promptly after it shall receive notice thereof, of the time when such
         registration statement has become effective


                                       9
<PAGE>   70

         or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such registration
         statement has been filed;

                  (x)      notify the sellers of such Registrable Shares of any
         request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of such
         registration statement or prospectus or for additional information;

                  (xi)     prepare (and afford counsel for the selling Investors
         reasonable opportunity to review and comment on) and file with the
         Commission, promptly upon the request of any seller of such Registrable
         Shares, any amendments or supplements to such registration statement or
         prospectus which, in the written opinion of counsel selected by the
         holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares being registered, may
         be required under the Securities Act in connection with the
         distribution of Registrable Shares by such seller;

                  (xii)    prepare and promptly file with the Commission and
         promptly notify each seller of such Registrable Shares of the filing of
         such amendment or supplement to such registration statement or
         prospectus as may be necessary to correct any statements or omissions
         if, at the time when a prospectus relating to such securities is
         required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event shall have
         occurred as the result of which any such prospectus or any other
         prospectus as then in effect would include an untrue statement of a
         material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
         statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
         were made, not misleading;

                  (xiii)   advise each seller of such Registrable Shares,
         promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of
         the issuance of any stop order by the Commission suspending the
         effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or
         threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and use all reasonable
         efforts promptly to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain
         its withdrawal if such stop order is issued;

                  (xiv)    (A) at least 48 hours prior to the filing of any
         registration statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement to
         such registration statement or prospectus furnish a copy thereof to
         each seller of such Registrable Shares and (B) refrain from filing any
         such registration statement, prospectus, amendment or supplement to
         which counsel selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable
         Shares being registered shall have objected in writing on the grounds
         that such amendment or supplement may not comply in all material
         respects with the requirements of the Securities Act;

                  (xv)     at the request of any seller of such Registrable
         Shares furnish on the date or dates provided for in the underwriting
         agreement, if any, or upon the effective date of the registration
         statement: (A) an opinion of counsel, addressed to the underwriters, if
         any, and the sellers of Registrable Shares, covering such matters as
         such underwriters, if any, and sellers may reasonably request and as
         are customarily covered by the issuer's counsel in an underwritten
         offering; and (B) a letter or letters from the independent certified
         public accountants of the Company addressed to the underwriters, if
         any, and the


                                       10
<PAGE>   71

         sellers of Registrable Shares, covering such matters as such
         underwriters, if any, and sellers may reasonably request and as are
         customarily covered in accountant's letters in connection with an
         underwritten offering;

                  (xvi)    during such time as any Investor may be engaged in a
         distribution of Registrable Shares, comply with Regulation M
         promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable;

                  (xvii)   participate with the Investors in any road show in
         connection with an underwritten offering; and

                  (xviii)  otherwise comply with the provisions of the
         Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities
         covered by such registration statement in accordance with the intended
         method of disposition and make generally available to its security
         holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
         satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and
         Rule 158 thereunder.

                  (b)      Each Investor that sells Registrable Shares pursuant
to a registration under this Agreement agrees as follows:

                  (i)      Such seller shall cooperate as reasonably requested
         by the Company with the Company in connection with the preparation of
         the registration statement, and for so long as the Company is obligated
         to file and keep effective the registration statement, shall provide to
         the Company, in writing, for use in the registration statement, all
         such information regarding such seller and its plan of distribution of
         Registrable Shares as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Company
         to prepare the registration statement and prospectus covering the
         Registrable Shares, to maintain the currency and effectiveness thereof
         and otherwise to comply with all applicable requirements of law in
         connection therewith; and

                  (ii)     During such time as such seller may be engaged in a
         distribution of the Registrable Shares, such seller shall (A) comply
         with Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent
         applicable, (B) distribute the Registrable Shares under the
         registration statement solely in the manner described in the
         registration statement and (C) cease distribution of such Registrable
         Shares pursuant to such registration statement upon receipt of written
         notice from the Company that the prospectus covering the Registrable
         Shares contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits a
         material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
         statements therein not misleading.

                  SECTION 5.6.      Registration Expenses. (a) All expenses
incident to the Company's performance of or compliance with this Agreement,
including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees of
transfer agents and registrars, fees and expenses of compliance with securities
or blue sky laws, fees of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
printing expenses, road show expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Company, fees and expenses of the Company's independent certified public
accountants, and the fees and expenses of any underwriters (excluding
underwriting fees, expenses, discounts or commissions attributable to the
Registrable Shares included in such registration, which will be


                                       11
<PAGE>   72

paid or borne by the Investors holding or selling such Registrable Shares) and
other Persons retained by the Company (all such expenses being herein called
"Registration Expenses"), will be borne by the Company. In addition, the Company
will pay its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and
expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties),
the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the expense of any
liability insurance obtained by the Company and the expenses and fees for
listing or authorizing for quotation the securities to be registered on each
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which any shares of Common
Stock are then listed or quoted.

                  (b)      In connection with a Demand Registration (or one
take-down under the Shelf Registration in lieu of a Demand Registration)
effected pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Investors
covered by such registration for the reasonable fees and expenses not in excess
of $50,000 of one (but only one) special counsel for the Investors chosen by the
holders of a majority of such Registrable Shares. In connection with each
Piggyback Registration, such holders shall bear all such fees and expenses of
their counsel.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding Sections 5.6(a) and 5.6(b) above, the
Investors agree that in the event any Investors withdraw any registration
demand, such Investors shall either pay the Registration Expenses incurred in
such registration or count such withdrawn demand toward their permitted Demand
Registration, as set forth in the first proviso to Section 5.1(a).

                  SECTION 5.7.      Indemnification. (a) In the event of a
registration of the Registrable Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to the
terms hereof, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each seller of Registrable Shares, its
officers, directors and partners and each Person who controls such seller
(within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees except as limited by Section 5.7(c))
caused by, arising out of, resulting from or related to any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement
under which such Registrable Shares were registered, any prospectus or
preliminary prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information
furnished in writing to the Company or any managing underwriter by any such
seller or any such controlling person expressly for use therein. In connection
with an underwritten offering, the Company will indemnify such underwriters,
their officers and directors and each Person who controls such underwriters
(within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) to the same
extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the sellers of
Registrable Shares (and with the same exception with respect to information
furnished or omitted by such underwriter or controlling person thereof) and in
connection therewith the Company shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form containing such provisions for indemnification and contribution
as shall be reasonably requested by the underwriters. The reimbursements
required by this Section 5.7(a) will be made by periodic payments during the
course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or
expenses incurred.

                  (b)      In the event of a registration of the Registrable
Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to the terms hereof, each Investor that
sells any Registrable Shares pursuant thereto


                                       12
<PAGE>   73

agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the Company, its directors and officers and each Person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) and each
underwriter and controlling person thereof against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees except as limited by Section 5.7(c)) caused by, arising out of, resulting
from or related to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any registration statement under which such Registrable Shares were
registered, any prospectus or preliminary prospectus contained therein, or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is contained in any information
so furnished in writing to the Company or any managing underwriter by such
seller or a controlling person thereof expressly for use therein. The
reimbursements required by this Section 5.7(b) will be made by periodic payments
during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are
received or expenses incurred.

                  (c)      Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will
(i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with
respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give
such notice shall not limit the rights of such Person except to the extent such
failure to give notice shall materially prejudice the rights of the indemnifying
party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment (with
written advice of counsel) a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the
indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement without the indemnified
party's prior written consent unless such settlement includes an unconditional
release of the indemnified party from liability relating to the claim. An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense
of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to
such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment (with written advice of counsel)
of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such
indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such
claim.

                  (d)      Each party hereto agrees that, if for any reason the
indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 5.7(a), 5.7(b) or 5.7(c) are
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect
of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect
thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified
party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such
indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5.7(d) were determined by pro
rata allocation


                                       13
<PAGE>   74

(even if the Investors or any underwriters or all of them were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not
take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 5.7(d).
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof)
referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or, except as provided in Section 5.7(c), defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.7(d), no holder shall be
required to contribute an amount greater than the dollar amount of the proceeds
received by such holder with respect to the sale of any Registrable Shares. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Investors'
obligations in this Section 5.7(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion
to the amount of Registrable Shares registered by them and not joint.

                  (e)      The indemnification and contribution provided for
under this Agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer,
director or controlling Person of such indemnified party.

                  SECTION 5.8.      Compliance with Rule 144. The Company shall
(i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144, (ii) file with the Company in a timely manner all
reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and (iii) at the request of any holder who proposes to sell
securities in compliance with Rule 144, forthwith furnish to such holder a
written statement of compliance with the reporting requirements of the
Commission as set forth in Rule 144 and make available to such Investors such
information as will enable the Investors to make sales pursuant to Rule 144.

                  SECTION 5.9.      Participation in Underwritten Registrations.
No Person may participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten
unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person's securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person or Persons
entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes
all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

                  SECTION 5.10.     Termination of Registration Rights. The
registration rights provided hereunder shall terminate with respect to any
holder of Registrable Shares on such date as such holder can sell all its shares
in any three-month period pursuant to Rule 144.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 6.1.      Termination. This Agreement shall
automatically terminate upon the earlier of (i) the mutual consent of all the
parties hereto and (ii) the end of the Standstill Period. Upon the termination
of this Agreement, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect and no
party hereto shall have any liability to the other party hereto in respect
thereof, except that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for
any breach of this Agreement prior to its termination.

                  SECTION 6.2.      Legend and Stop Transfer Order. To assist in
effectuating the provisions of this Agreement, the Investors consent and shall
cause any of their Affiliates that own Voting Securities to consent:

                  (i)      to the placement of the following legend on all
         certificates representing Voting Securities hereafter owned, directly
         or indirectly, by the Investors or any of their Affiliates until such
         time as such securities have been transferred in accordance with
         Article III or, if earlier, the first anniversary of the Closing:

                  "The securities represented by this certificate are subject to
                  the provisions of a Standstill and Registration Rights

satisfactory to the Company (which, for such purpose, shall include Reboul,
MacMurray, Hewitt, Maynard & Kristol) to the effect that such legends are no
