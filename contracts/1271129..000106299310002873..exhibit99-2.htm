Acquiror, Target or any of its subsidiaries by a third party for which Acquiror,
Target or any of its subsidiaries may be entitled to indemnification, Acquiror,
Target or its subsidiaries, as applicable, shall give notice (the "<B>Indemnity

participate in any negotiations or proceedings with respect to such Claim.
Acquiror, Target or its subsidiaries, as applicable, shall not settle or
compromise any such Claim without the prior written consent of Spinco, unless
Spinco has not, within 20 Business Days after the giving of the Indemnity
Notice, given notice to Acquiror, Target or its subsidiaries, as applicable,

receipt thereof by Fronteer for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the
applicable provincial taxing authority). Fronteer will not be responsible for

received more than 90 days following the Effective Date, but Fronteer will have
no obligation to do so and will assume no responsibility or liability by doing
so. Upon receipt of a Letter of Transmittal in which an Eligible Holder has
indicated that it intends to make such election, Fronteer will deliver or cause
