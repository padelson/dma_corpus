alter or change the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) to be provided to holders of FNB Common Stock
(as defined below) as provided for in this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;adversely affect the tax treatment of

into in the ordinary course of business and, to the best of LSB&#146;s knowledge, in accordance with
prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority
and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and
binding obligations of LSB or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms
(except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies), and are in

Subsidiaries.

the imposition, on LSB of any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local,
state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
(&#147;CERCLA&#148;), pending or threatened against LSB, which liability or obligation will, either

LSB, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that will, individually or in the

Material Adverse Effect on FNB. No Tax return or report of FNB or its Subsidiaries has been
subjected to audit or examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) or the North Carolina
Department of Revenue in the last five years and neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any indication of a pending audit or examination in connection with any Tax return or
report and, to the best of FNB&#146;s knowledge, no such return or report is subject to adjustment.
Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed any waiver or extended the statute of
limitations (or been asked to execute a waiver or extend a statute of limitations) with respect to
any tax year, the audit of any such tax return or report, or the assessment or collection of any
tax. To the best of FNB&#146;s knowledge, there are no material disputes pending, or claims asserted
for, Taxes or assessments upon FNB or any of its Subsidiaries for which FNB does not have adequate
reserves. In addition, (A)&nbsp;proper and accurate amounts have been withheld by FNB and its
Subsidiaries from their employees for all prior periods in compliance in all material respects with
the tax withholding provisions of applicable federal, state and local laws, except where failure to
do so will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, (B)
federal, state and local returns which are accurate and complete in all material respects have been
filed by FNB and its Subsidiaries for all periods for which returns were due with respect to income
tax withholding, Social Security and unemployment taxes, except where failure to do so will not,
either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, (C)&nbsp;the amounts
shown on such federal, state or local returns to be due and payable have been paid in full or
adequate provision therefor has been included by FNB in its consolidated financial statements,
except where failure to do so will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on FNB and (D)&nbsp;there are no Tax liens upon any property or assets of FNB or its Subsidiaries
except liens for current taxes not yet due or liens that will not have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section&nbsp;481 of the Code by reason of a
voluntary change in accounting method initiated by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, and the IRS has
not initiated or proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method, in either case, which
has had or will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.
Except as set forth in the financial statements described in Section&nbsp;4.6, neither FNB nor any of
its Subsidiaries has entered into a transaction which is being accounted for as an installment
obligation under Section&nbsp;453 of the Code, which will have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.
