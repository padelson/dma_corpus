AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 26, 2007 (this "Agreement"), by and between FNB Financial Services Corporation, a North Carolina corporation ("FNB"), and LSB Bancshares, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("LSB"). 

  

WITNESSETH: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of FNB and LSB have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein in which FNB will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into LSB (the "Merger"), so that LSB is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 1.1 _The Merger_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with Business Corporation Act of the State of North Carolina (the "NCBCA"), at the Effective Time (as defined below), FNB shall merge with and into LSB. LSB shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of FNB shall terminate. 

  

 (b) FNB and LSB may at any time change the method of effecting the combination of FNB and LSB including without limitation the provisions of this Article I, if and to the extent they deem such change to be desirable, including without limitation to provide for a merger of either party with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the other; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) to be provided to holders of FNB Common Stock (as defined below) as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of shareholders of FNB or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger which shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina (the "North Carolina Secretary") on the Closing Date. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 55-11-06 of the NCBCA. 

  

 1.4 _Conversion of FNB Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of FNB, LSB or the holder of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, no par value per share, of FNB (the "FNB Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of FNB Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by FNB or LSB or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than shares of FNB Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, whether held directly or indirectly by FNB or LSB, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") or shares of FNB Common Stock held on account of a debt previously contracted ("DPC Shares")), shall be converted into the right to receive 1.07 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of LSB (the "LSB Common Stock"). 

  

 (b) All of the shares of FNB Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each such share of FNB Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the number of whole shares of LSB Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of FNB Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of FNB Common Stock or LSB Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, all shares of FNB Common Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by FNB or LSB or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist (except that they shall become authorized but unissued shares of LSB Common Stock) and no stock of LSB or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 1.5 _LSB Capital Stock_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.4(c), at and after the Effective Time, each share of LSB Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date shall remain an issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

  

 1.6 _Options_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by FNB to purchase shares of FNB Common Stock which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of FNB Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of LSB Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price 

   ##### 

  

    

determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the FNB
Stock Plans (as defined below) and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder): 

   

 (i) The number of shares of LSB Common Stock to be subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of FNB Common Stock subject to the original option and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of LSB Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole share; and 

   

 (ii) The exercise price per share of LSB Common Stock under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of FNB Common Stock under the original option divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. 

  

 (b) The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration and other terms of the new option shall be the same as the original option except that all references to FNB shall be deemed to be references to LSB. 

  

 1.7 _Charter_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of LSB, with such amendments as to which the parties may hereafter agree to submit to LSBs shareholders, including, without limitation, amendments to change the corporate name of LSB to a name mutually agreeable to LSB and FNB, to alter the terms of the directors, and to establish in uncontested elections the election of directors by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present at the applicable meeting of shareholders, which may be properly approved by LSBs Board of Directors and by such shareholders (the "Charter"), shall be the Charter of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. 

  

 1.8 _By-Laws_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the By-Laws of LSB shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law; provided, however, that the By-Laws shall be amended as of the Effective Time to reflect the amendments to the Charter described in Section 1.7 and as otherwise agreed by LSB and FNB. 

  

 1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

ARTICLE II 

   

EXCHANGE OF SHARES  

  

 2.1 _LSB to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time, LSB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with LSBs stock transfer agent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of FNB Common Stock in certificated or uncertificated form, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, the shares of LSB Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and shares of LSB Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of FNB Common Stock. 

  

 2.2 _Exchange of Shares; Notification and Payment Procedures_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, with respect to each share of FNB Common Stock held in certificated form (each such certificate, a "Certificate"), the Exchange Agent shall mail to each such holder of record of one or more Certificates a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for shares of LSB Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of FNB Common Stock represented by 

   ##### 

  

    

such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a book entry on the records of the Surviving Corporation
showing such holder to hold of record the number of whole shares of LSB
Common Stock to which such holder of FNB Common Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check
representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate
or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. With respect to
shares of FNB Common Stock held in uncertificated ("book entry" form), the
Exchange Agent shall (x) enter a book entry on the records of the Surviving
Corporation showing the holder of such shares to hold of record the number of
shares of LSB Common Stock to which such holder of FNB Common Stock shall have
become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and (y) cause a
check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of shares of FNB Common Stock held
by such holder in uncertificated form. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. The Exchange Agent, acting
as the Surviving Corporations stock transfer agent, will maintain a book
entry list of the whole shares of LSB Common Stock to which each former
holder of record of FNB Common Stock is entitled. 

  

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to FNB Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II (including Section 2.2(h) in the case of lost certificates). After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of LSB Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 (c) If any holder desires the shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued to such holder to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered or in a name other than the name in which the book entry record thereof is recorded, as applicable, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that (i) the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer or (ii) the book entry holder provide written transfer instructions in the form required by the Exchange Agent, and, in either instance, that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of LSB Common Stock in any such other name, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) As soon as practical after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of shares of FNB Common Stock in uncertificated, book entry form a written notice (the "Notice Letter") confirming the whole shares of LSB Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares to be issued and paid to such holder pursuant to this Agreement and containing 

   ##### 

  

    

such other information as is required under Section 55-6-26 of the NCBCA. A
check in the amount of such cash shall accompany the Notice Letter. 

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of FNB of the shares of FNB Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and, as applicable, shares of LSB Common Stock shall be issued in exchange therefor in book entry form as provided by this Article II. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of LSB Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or the exchange of shares of FNB Common Stock held in uncertificated, book entry form, no dividend or distribution with respect to LSB Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of LSB. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, LSB shall pay to each former shareholder of FNB who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of LSB Common Stock on the Global Select Market of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (the "Nasdaq") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of LSB Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. 

  

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of FNB for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to LSB. Any former shareholders of FNB who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to LSB for payment of the shares of LSB Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the LSB Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of LSB Common Stock, as the case may be, such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of FNB, LSB, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of FNB Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by LSB, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as LSB reasonably may determine is necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of LSB Common Stock in book entry form and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

LSB has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB. LSB is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). True and complete copies of the Charter and By-Laws of LSB, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by LSB to FNB. 

  

 As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to FNB, LSB or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis; provided that, in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any effect to the extent attributable to or resulting from (A) any changes in laws, regulations or interpretations of laws or regulations generally affecting the banking, bank holding company or financial holding company businesses, (B) any change in generally accepted accounting principles recognized in the United States ("GAAP") or regulatory accounting requirements, generally affecting the banking, bank holding company or financial holding company businesses, (C) events, conditions or trends in economic, business or financial conditions generally affecting the banking, bank holding company or financial holding company businesses specifically, (D) changes in national or international political or social conditions including the engagement by the United States in hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack upon or within the United States, or any of its territories, possessions or diplomatic or consular offices or upon any military installation, equipment or personnel of the United States, (E) the effect of the actions expressly permitted or required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior informed written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (F) the announcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any bank, savings bank, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes or is a special purpose entity which issues trust preferred securities. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each LSB Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

All of the issued and outstanding shares of LSB Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, except pursuant to the terms of (i) options to acquire 604,925 shares of LSB Common Stock issued pursuant to employee and director stock plans of LSB in effect as of the date hereof (the "LSB Stock Plans"), and (ii) rights issued under and shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the LSB Rights Agreement, dated as of February 10, 1998 (the "LSB Rights Agreement"), LSB does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of LSB Capital Stock or any other equity securities of LSB or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of LSB Capital Stock (collectively, including the items contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, the "LSB Rights"). As of the date hereof, no shares of LSB Capital Stock were reserved for issuance, except for 10,000,000 shares of LSB Common Stock reserved for issuance under the LSB Rights Agreement and 604,925 shares of LSB Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options pursuant to the LSB Stock Plans.

agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or
any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 (a) Neither LSB nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of any directors, officers or employees, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the consummation or shareholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from FNB, LSB, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof which, individually or in the aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB, (iii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement that has not been filed or incorporated by reference in the LSB Reports, (iv) which materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by LSB or upon consummation of the Merger will materially restrict the ability of the Surviving Corporation to engage in any line of business in which a bank holding company may lawfully engage, (v) with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement) or (vi) (including any stock option plan, stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan) any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any shareholder approval or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB. LSB has previously made available to FNB true and correct copies of all employment and deferred compensation agreements which are in writing and to which LSB is a party. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 3.14(a), whether or not set forth in the LSB Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a "LSB Contract", and neither LSB nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB. 

  

 (b) (i) Each LSB Contract is valid and binding on LSB or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii) LSB and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each LSB Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB, and (iii) no event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of LSB or any of its Subsidiaries under any such LSB Contract, except where such default, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB. 

  

 3.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither LSB nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been since January 1, 2003, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2003, has adopted any board resolutions at the request of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not 

   ##### 

  

    

set forth in the LSB Disclosure Schedule, an "LSB Regulatory Agreement"), nor
has LSB or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2003, by any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing
or requesting any such Regulatory Agreement. 

  

 3.16 _Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements, whether entered into for the account of LSB or for the account of a customer of LSB or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of business and, to the best of LSBs knowledge, in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of LSB or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies), and are in full force and effect. LSB and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; and, to LSBs knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder. 

  

 3.17 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of LSB included in the LSB Financial Statements and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, since December 31, 2005, neither LSB nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or will have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB. 

  

 3.18 _Insurance_. LSB and its Subsidiaries have in effect insurance coverage with reputable insurers or are self-insured, which in respect of amounts, premiums, types and risks insured, constitutes reasonably adequate coverage against all risks customarily insured against by bank holding companies and their subsidiaries comparable in size and operations to LSB and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 3.19 _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result in the imposition, on LSB of any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), pending or threatened against LSB, which liability or obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB. To the best knowledge of LSB, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that will, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on LSB. LSB is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on LSB. 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.20 _State Takeover Laws; Rights Plan_. The Board of Directors of LSB has approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for purposes of Sections 55-9A-01 through -09 of the NCBCA, such that the provisions of such Sections of the NCBCA will not apply to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. LSB is not and has not been the "beneficial owner" of more than 20% of the "voting shares" of FNB, as those terms are defined in Sections 55-9-01 through -05 of the NCBCA. The Board of Directors of LSB has taken all actions necessary under the Rights Plan to provide that the provisions of the Rights Plan will not be or become operative with respect to the Merger. 

  

 3.21 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, LSB has no reason to believe that the Merger will not qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 3.22 _Obstacles to Regulatory Approval_. To the best knowledge of the management of LSB, there exists no facts or condition relating to LSB that may reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the parties hereto from obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals (as defined in Section 7.1(c)); and, if any such fact or condition becomes known to LSB, LSB shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) days after obtaining such knowledge) give notice of such fact or condition to FNB in the manner provided herein.

there are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine
claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the FNB Benefit Plans
or any trusts related thereto which will have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

  

 (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) in any payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of FNB or any of its affiliates from FNB or any of its affiliates under any FNB Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any FNB Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits that will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

  

 4.12 _SEC Reports_. FNB has previously made available to LSB an accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since January 1, 2003 by FNB with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the "FNB SEC Reports") and prior to the date hereof and (b) communication mailed by FNB to its shareholders since January 1, 2003 and prior to the date hereof, and no such FNB SEC Report or communication, as of the date thereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date hereof) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2003, as of their respective dates, all FNB SEC Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. 

  

 4.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. 

  

 (a) FNB and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all material respects with, and are not in default in any material respect under, any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Except as will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, FNB and each FNB Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of FNB, any FNB Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of FNB or of any FNB Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account that will have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account. 

  

 4.14 _Certain Contracts_. 

  

 (a) Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of any directors, officers or employees other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the consummation or shareholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from FNB, LSB, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof which, individually or in the aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, (iii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement that has not been filed or incorporated by reference in the FNB Reports, (iv) which materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by FNB or upon consummation of the Merger will materially restrict the ability of the Surviving Corporation to engage in any line of business in which a bank holding company may lawfully engage, (v) with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement) or (vi) (including any stock option plan, stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan) any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any shareholder approval or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. FNB has previously made available to LSB true and correct copies of all employment and deferred compensation agreements which are in writing and to which FNB is a party. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 4.14(a), whether or not set forth in the FNB Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a "FNB Contract", and neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which will have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

  

 (b) (i) Each FNB Contract is valid and binding on FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii) FNB and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each FNB Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, and (iii) no event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of FNB or any 

   ##### 

  

    

of its Subsidiaries under any such FNB Contract, except where such default,
either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse
Effect on FNB. 

  

 4.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been since January 1, 2003, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2003, has adopted any board resolutions at the request of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not set forth in the FNB Disclosure Schedule, a "FNB Regulatory Agreement"), nor has FNB or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2003, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any such Regulatory Agreement. 

  

 4.16 _Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements, whether entered into for the account of FNB or for the account of a customer of FNB or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of business and, to the best of FNBs knowledge, in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of FNB or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies), and are in full force and effect. FNB and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; and to FNBs knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder. 

  

 4.17 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of FNB included in the FNB Financial Statements and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, since December 31, 2005, neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or will have, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

  

 4.18 _Insurance_. FNB and its Subsidiaries have in effect insurance coverage with reputable insurers or are self-insured, which in respect of amounts, premiums, types and risks insured, constitutes reasonably adequate coverage against all risks customarily insured against by bank holding companies and their subsidiaries comparable in size and operations to FNB and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 4.19 _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that reasonably could result in the imposition, on FNB of any liability or obligation arising under 

   ##### 

  

    

common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute,
regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, CERCLA, pending
or threatened against FNB, which liability or obligation will have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. To the
best knowledge of FNB, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding,
claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability
or obligation that will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on FNB. FNB is not subject to any agreement, order,
judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court, governmental
authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or
obligation with respect to the foregoing that will have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

  

 4.20 _State Takeover Laws; Charter Provisions_. The Board of Directors of FNB has approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for purposes of Sections 55-9A-01 through 09 of the NCBCA and the 75% voting share requirement of Article VI of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of FNB, such that the provisions of such Sections and Article VI will not apply to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. FNB is not and has not been the "beneficial owner" of more than 20% of the "voting shares" of LSB, as those terms are used in Section 55-9-01 through -05 of the NCBCA. 

  

 4.21 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, FNB has no reason to believe that the Merger will not qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 4.22 _Obstacles to Regulatory Approval_. To the best knowledge of management of FNB, there exists no facts or condition relating to FNB that may reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the parties hereto from obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals; and, if any such fact or condition becomes known to FNB, FNB shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) days after obtaining such knowledge) give notice of such fact or condition to LSB in the manner provided herein.

Each of FNB and LSB shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and FNB and LSB shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders. LSB shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and FNB shall furnish all information concerning FNB and the holders of FNB Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. FNB and LSB shall 

   ##### 

  

    

have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to FNB or LSB, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein. 

  

 (c) FNB and LSB shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of FNB, LSB or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) FNB and LSB shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined below) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. 

  

 6.2 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of LSB and FNB, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of LSB and FNB shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents which LSB or FNB, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither LSB nor FNB nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of LSBs or FNBs, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each of LSB and FNB agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with entering into this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep confidential, and will cause its representatives to keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the providing party or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from publicly available sources. If this Agreement is terminated or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated, each party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof containing information and data as to the other party to be returned to the other party. 

  

 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. 

  

 6.3 _Shareholders  Approvals_. Each of FNB and LSB shall call a meeting of its shareholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approvals required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts, except as may otherwise be required by applicable law, to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of each of LSB and FNB shall recommend approval of the Merger to the shareholders of LSB and FNB, as the case may be, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of LSB and FNB, as the case may be, the vote in favor of, the adoption of this Agreement required by the NCBCA to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of FNB and LSB shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by FNB or LSB or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.5 _Affiliates_. FNB shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of FNB to deliver to LSB, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and prior to the date of the shareholders meetings called by FNB and LSB to approve this Agreement, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit 6.5(a)(1) hereto, providing that such person will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of FNB Common Stock 

   ##### 

  

    

held by such "affiliate" to be received by such "affiliate" in the Merger
except in compliance with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC. 

  

 6.6 _Stock Quotation_. LSB shall cause the shares of LSB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be qualified for quotation on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. The symbol for the shares of LSB Common Stock after the Effective Time shall be that agreed upon by FNB and LSB and available for use. 

  

 6.7 _Employee Benefit Plans; Employment Agreements_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, unless otherwise mutually determined, the LSB Benefit Plans and FNB Benefit Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to employees of LSB or FNB (or their Subsidiaries), respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective Time until such time as the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to applicable law, the terms of this Agreement and the terms of such plans, adopt new benefit plans with respect to employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "New Benefit Plans"), or otherwise merge or combine existing FNB Benefit Plans into LSB Benefit Plans, or vice versa. Prior to the Closing Date, LSB and FNB shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the LSB Benefit Plans and FNB Benefit Plans with a view towards developing appropriate New Benefit Plans or combining or merging existing benefit plans for the employees covered thereby. 

  

 (b) The foregoing notwithstanding, the Surviving Corporation agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all benefits vested as of the date hereof under the FNB Benefit Plans or the LSB Benefit Plans or under other contracts, arrangements, commitments, or understandings described in the FNB Disclosure Schedule and the LSB Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (c) Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be interpreted as preventing the Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying or terminating any FNB Benefit Plans, LSB Benefit Plans, or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings, in accordance with their terms and applicable law. In particular, FNB and LSB agree that FNB shall "freeze" its defined benefit plan prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) It is the intention of LSB and FNB, during the period shortly following the execution of this Merger Agreement, to coordinate efforts towards establishing a retention and severance program, consistent with the strategy for the Merger, in an effort to retain and provide incentives to key personnel for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation in a manner that provides for equitable treatment of similarly situated employees of LSB and FNB. 

  

 (e) During the period following the execution of this Merger Agreement, LSB and FNB shall (i) coordinate efforts toward amending employment agreements between either of them, or their Subsidiaries, and various of their or such Subsidiaries employees to bring such agreements into conformity with applicable federal income tax laws and regulations and to increase the consistency of the provisions of those employment agreements with employment agreements of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Bank with its or their employees, and (ii) seek to obtain waivers of "change of control" severance payment provisions of those 

   ##### 

  

    

employees of LSB or FNB, or any Subsidiary of either, whose employment
agreements would require such payments as a consequence of the Merger. 

  

 (f) Any employee of an FNB Subsidiary or an LSB Subsidiary as of the Effective Time who is not a party to an employment agreement with such Subsidiary and whose employment is terminated by the Surviving Bank or a Subsidiary thereof at, or within six (6) months after, the Effective Time, other than for "cause" as set forth in the employment policies of the Surviving Bank as of the Effective Time ("Non-Continuing Employee"), will be paid such severance as the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank, as applicable, determine on a case-by-case basis, but in no event shall such severance be less than that provided for in the severance payment policies of FNB or LSB, as applicable, prior to the execution of this Agreement. Any Non-Continuing Employee will be permitted to obtain continued health insurance coverage through the exercise of his or her COBRA rights offered under the Surviving Banks health insurance coverage, and the Surviving Bank will give any required COBRA notices. 

  

 (g) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to Section 6.7(a), any employee of an FNB Subsidiary who becomes an employee of the Surviving Bank or a Subsidiary thereof at the Effective Time (a "New Employee") shall be given credit for his or her full years of service with the FNB Subsidiary for: (i) eligibility for participation and vesting, but not funding, in the Surviving Banks Section 401(k) savings plan; and (ii) all purposes under the Surviving Banks other benefit plans (including entitlement to vacation and sick leave). For purposes of the Surviving Banks health insurance coverage, a New Employees participation will be without regard to pre-existing condition requirements under the Surviving Banks health insurance plan, provided that any such pre-existing condition at the Effective Time was covered under health insurance plan(s) of the FNB Subsidiary at the Effective Time and the New Employee provides evidence of such previous coverage in a form satisfactory to the Surviving Banks health insurance carrier. Subject to Section 6.7(a), for the calendar year during which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Bank or applicable Subsidiary thereof will grant to each New Employee a number of days of sick, vacation and personal leave, respectively, equal, in each case, to (i) the full number of such days to which the New Employee would be entitled for that year, based on his or her credited years of service and in accordance with the Surviving Banks standard policies, less (ii) the number of days of sick, vacation and personal leave used by the New Employee as an employee of an FNB Subsidiary during that calendar year.

 6.8  _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of FNB, any of its Subsidiaries, any of its Non-Subsidiary Affiliates or a fiduciary or administrator of a plan for the benefit of its directors or employees including any entity specified in the FNB Disclosure Schedule (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity specified in the FNB Disclosure Schedule or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, LSB shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 (b) LSB shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of FNB, its Subsidiaries, its Non-Subsidiary Affiliates or a fiduciary or administrator of a plan for the benefit of its employees or directors or any entity specified in the FNB Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (or the period of the applicable statute of limitations, if longer) by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by LSB (provided that LSB may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such. 

  

 (c) In the event LSB or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of LSB assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, without 

   ##### 

  

    

limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of LSB, on the one hand, and a
Subsidiary of FNB, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers
and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by, and at the sole expense of, LSB. 

  

 6.10 _Advice of Changes_. FNB and LSB shall each promptly advise the other party of any change or event (i) having a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

 6.11 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of FNB and LSB shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of FNB Common Stock and LSB Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of FNB Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of FNB Common Stock and any shares of LSB Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 

  

 6.12 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. If FNB delivers to LSB in a timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding those officers and directors of FNB subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the "FNB Insiders"), the number of shares of LSB Common Stock held or to be held by each such FNB Insider expected to be exchanged for LSB Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of the options to purchase shares of FNB Common Stock held by each such FNB Insider and expected to be converted into options to purchase LSB Common Stock in the Merger, the Board of Directors of LSB, or a committee of nonemployee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the FNB Insiders of LSB Common Stock in exchange for shares of FNB Common Stock, and of option to purchase shares of LSB Common Stock upon conversion of options to purchase FNB Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the information provided by FNB, are approved by such Board of Directors or by such committee thereof, and are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, such that any such receipt shall be so exempt.

 (c) by either the Board of Directors of FNB or the Board of Directors of LSB if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; or

 P. O. Box 867

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

   

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of FNB Financial Services Corporation, a North Carolina corporation ("FNB"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February ___, 2007 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and between FNB and LSB Bancshares, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("LSB"), FNB will be merged with and into LSB (the "Merger") and that as a result of the Merger, I may receive shares of LSB Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in exchange for shares of FNB Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by me. 

  

 I represent, warrant and covenant to LSB that in the event I receive any LSB Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

  

       | a.  |   | I shall not make any sale, transfer or other
disposition of the LSB Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and
Regulations.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | I have carefully read this letter and the Merger
Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations
upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of LSB Common Stock to
the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for FNB.  
      
    | c.  |   | I have been advised that the issuance of LSB Common
Stock to me pursuant to the Merger has been registered with the Commission
under the Act on a Registration Statement of Form S-4. I have also been
advised, however, that, since at the time the Merger was submitted for a vote
of the shareholders of FNB I was deemed to have been an affiliate of FNB
and

sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions
of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the

statement under said act or an exemption from such registration."  
      
    | f.  |   | I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my
LSB Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, LSB reserves the right to put the
following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:  
      
    |   |   | "The shares represented by this certificate have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person
who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the
holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof within the meaning of Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold,
pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."
