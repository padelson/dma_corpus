Stock Certificate formerly representing Shares shall not have been surrendered
prior to such twelve (12) month period (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any Merger consideration would otherwise escheat to or become

shall, to the extent permitted by Legal Requirement, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

3.6. _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

3.6.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Share
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is

thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and properly demands

the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive cash in the amount contemplated by

shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive such rights as are granted to such holder of Dissenting Shares under

3.6.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Stockholder fails to
perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, each Dissenting Share held
by such Stockholder will be treated as if such Dissenting Share had been
converted as of the later of the occurrence of such event and the Effective
Time into a right to receive upon delivery to Parent of a validly executed
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and Stock Certificates (or affidavits in accordance with _Section
3.5.3_), cash in the amount specified in _Section 3.1.1_, to be paid as
provided in this Agreement and the Payments Agreement.

 



 

3.7. _No Further Transfers_. As of and after the Effective Time there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the books of the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

holder of record of a Stock Certificate shall have any rights as a stockholder
of the Company, except the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement. All Stock Certificates presented to the
Payments Administrator, as contemplated by _Section 3.5_, shall be deemed
cancelled upon such presentment.

 



 

3.8. _Withholding_. Each party hereto, the Payments Administrator and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as
such party, the Payments Administrator or the Escrow Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law, and pay such withheld
amounts over to the appropriate Governmental Authority; _provided_ , that the
withholding party shall (and in the case of the Payments Administrator or the
Escrow Agent, Parent

prior written notice of any such withholding to the party or parties from whom
amounts are to be withheld (other than with respect to backup withholding
under Section 3406 of the Code or any required withholding on amounts that
constitute wages or other compensatory amounts for Tax purposes), and the
parties shall take commercially reasonable steps to reduce or eliminate any
such withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
any party hereto and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. All compensatory amounts subject to payroll reporting and withholding
payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be payable
through the CompanyÂ’s payroll in accordance with applicable payroll
procedures.

Merger Sub of this Agreement or the consummation by them of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution,

, that Parent and its Representatives shall not unreasonably disrupt the

anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.4_, Parent and its
Representatives shall not be permitted to have access to (a) individual

Legal Requirements, (b) information that is subject to the attorney-client or
other similar privilege, or (c) information that the Company or any of its

parties thereto.

writing of:

 



 

(a) to the Knowledge of the Company or the knowledge of Parent, the occurrence
of any matter or event that would, or would be reasonably expected to, result

(b) to the Knowledge of the Company or the knowledge of Parent, the
commencement of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings (i)

5.5_, in the case of Parent, or (ii) threatened against such party to
restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction
contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.5.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a partyÂ’s good faith
failure to comply with this _Section 6.5_ shall not provide the other party
hereto or any of such other partyÂ’s Affiliates with a right not to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each case, to the
extent that any other provision of this Agreement would independently provide
such right.

 



 

6.6. _D andO Indemnification_.

 



 

6.6.1. For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect
of each of the foregoing, following receipt of any customary undertakings
required by applicable Legal Requirements) each current or former director or
officer, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and each such
person who served as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, Company Plan, or other Person
at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, together with such PersonÂ’s heirs, executors, administrators, and
estate, a " _Covered Party_ ") against any costs, expenses (including
advancing attorneysÂ’ fees and other expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim or Action to each Covered Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and following receipt of any
customary undertaking required by applicable Legal Requirements), losses,
judgments, fines, claims, damages, liabilities, and amounts paid in
settlement, in connection with any actual or threatened Actions arising out
of, relating to, or in connection with any action or omission occurring or
alleged to have occurred prior to or at Closing in such Covered PartyÂ’s
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
in such Covered PartyÂ’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension, Company Plan,
or other entity, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with
actions to enforce this _Section 6.6_ or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Covered Party. In the event of any such Action,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, reasonably
cooperate with the Covered Party in the defense of any such Action.

 



 

6.6.2. Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to ensure that all
rights to exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of expenses now
existing in favor of any Covered Party as provided in their respective
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational documents or
in any contract with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Covered Party.

 



 

6.6.3. The Company may obtain prior to the Closing fully paid "tail" insurance
policies (the " _D andO Tail_") with respect to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability, employment practices liability, and fiduciary liability insurance
for the benefit of the current and former directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing and with such
other terms as the Company may determine in its discretion. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, maintain the DandO Tail in full
force and effect for its full term and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored; _provided_ , that neither Parent nor the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be obligated to make any payments in connection with the maintenance of
the DandO Tail and any such payments will constitute Equityholder Transaction
Expenses.

 



 

6.6.4. It is the intent of the parties that with respect to all obligations
with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this
_Section 6.6_ that the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall be the indemnitor of first resort and accordingly shall be the primary
source of advancement, reimbursement and indemnification relative to any
Person that was a direct or indirect holder of Capital Stock of the Company or
its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing (or any Person that is or was an
Affiliate of such holder of Capital Stock, other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries). Neither Parent nor the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
have any right to seek contribution, indemnity or other reimbursement for any
of its obligations under this _Section 6.6_ from any such Person that was a
direct or indirect holder of Capital Stock of any Company or its Subsidiaries
at or prior to the Closing (or any Person that is or was an Affiliate of such
holder of Capital Stock, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 



      
 

 



 

6.6.5. The rights of each Person under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Person may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any other indemnification
arrangement, the provisions of applicable Legal Requirements, directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’, employment practices liability, or fiduciary liability insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section
6.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Closing indefinitely and expressly
are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Persons named
herein, each of whom is an express and intended third-party beneficiary of
this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

6.6.6. In the event that Parent, the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective successors or assigns, (a) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger or (b) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the applicable successors
and assigns shall fully assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.6_.

 



 

6.7. _Employee Matters._

 



 

6.7.1. Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who are so employed
as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and who continue their employment
with Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date
are hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Employees_." Except as may
otherwise be agreed to between Parent and a Company Employee, during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and, for each Company Employee, ending
on the earlier of (x) December 31, 2017, and (y) the date on which such
Company EmployeeÂ’s employment with Parent and its Affiliates is terminated for
any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide
each Company Employee with (i) at least the same base salary or hourly wages
(as applicable) and annual cash incentive compensation and commission
opportunities as provided to such Company Employees by the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) employee
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the employee benefits
provided to such Company Employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the immediately prior to the Closing. Additionally, Parent shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, provide severance pay and benefits to each
Company Employee that is terminated by Parent or any of its Affiliates without
"cause" on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date that are no
less favorable than the severance pay and benefits that would have been
provided to such Company Employee had such termination occurred immediately
prior to the Closing in accordance with the severance policy set forth on
_Section 6.7.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter_ or, in the case of any
Company Employee who is a party to an employment, severance or similar
agreement or entitled to severance pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements
providing for the payment of severance, such agreement or Legal Requirements,
as applicable.

 



 

6.7.2. For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and
entitlement to, and level of, benefits, where length of service is relevant
under any employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates providing
benefits to any Company Employee at or after the Closing (collectively, the "
_New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall receive service credit for service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, except (A) to
the extent any such service credit would result in the duplication of
benefits, (B) where such service was not recognized under a comparable plan of
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing, (C) for
benefit accruals pursuant to any defined benefit pension plan or any retiree
health or retiree welfare plan, provided, that, at the discretion of Parent,
Company Employees may be eligible to participate in such benefit plans, or (D)
where prior service with Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries) is not recognized for similarly-situated employees of Parent
and

 



      
 

 



 

its affiliates to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates.
In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Company Employee to
immediately be eligible to participate, without any waiting time or
satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans
to the extent that (i) coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under
any Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior
to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) such Company
Employee had satisfied all waiting time and other eligibility requirements
under the comparable Old Plan and (b) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause (i) all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such conditions were
inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plan, and (ii) any expenses
incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company
EmployeeÂ’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

6.7.3. Nothing in this _Section 6.7_, express or implied, (a) is intended to
or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto, including any
Company Employee or any dependent thereof, any right, benefit, or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (b) shall
establish, or constitute an amendment, termination, or modification of, or an
undertaking to amend, establish, terminate, or modify, any Company Plan or any
New Plan, or (c) shall create any obligation on the part of Parent, the
Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, to
employ any Company Employee for any period following the Closing.

 



 

6.8. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

6.8.1. The Equityholder Representative shall have the right to cause to be
prepared (and in such event the Company shall subsequently file), all income
and other material Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on prior to the
Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_
"). Following the Closing and until the Survival Date, Parent shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend any Pre-Closing Tax Return without
the prior written consent of the Equityholder Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). To the extent the
Equityholder Representative does not elect to prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, Tax Returns as set forth above, Parent shall prepare and
file, or cause to be prepared and filed, such Tax Returns; _provided_ , Parent
shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, such Tax Returns
consistent with past practice; _provided further_ that the Parent shall
provide the Equityholder Representative copies of any Tax Returns prepared
pursuant to this sentence not less than twenty (20) days prior to the date
such returns are required to be filed for comments, and shall include any
comments reasonably requested by the Equityholder Representative. The
provisions of this _Section 6.8.1_ shall apply only until the Survival Date.

 



 

6.8.2. In the event Parent or its Affiliates receives notice of any audit,
examination, claim or other proceeding with respect to which Parent may be
indemnified pursuant to _Section 9.1_ (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), Parent shall
inform the Equityholder Representative of such Tax Proceeding as soon as
possible but in any event within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice
thereof. The Equityholder Representative shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of any Tax Proceeding in a manner it deems appropriate;
provided, (i) Parent shall have the right to participate in any such Tax
Proceeding, at its own expense, (ii) the Equityholder Representative shall
keep

 



      
 

 



 

Parent reasonably informed of the status of such Tax Proceeding (including
providing Parent with copies of all material written correspondence regarding
such Tax Proceeding) and (iii) if such Tax Proceeding could reasonably be
expected to have a material impact on any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date or result in a material Tax cost to Parent
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the material reduction in any Tax
attributes), the Equityholder Representative shall not consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to such Tax Proceeding, enter into any settlement
with respect to such Tax Proceeding or cease defending such Tax Proceeding
without the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

6.8.3. Until the Survival Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the Equityholder Representative in
connection with the preparation of any Pre-Closing Tax Return and in
connection with any Tax Proceeding. Parent shall, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, retain all books and records with respect to income
Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to taxable
periods or portions thereof ending on the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof)
applicable to such taxable periods. Without limiting the foregoing, until the
Survival Date, Parent will (and will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
cooperate with the Equityholder Representative to enable it to utilize the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s existing tax return preparation firm(s) solely with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Returns that the Equityholder Representative
prepares or causes to be prepared pursuant to _Section 6.8.1_. Such
cooperation may include providing access to books and records and accounting
staff, and delegating authority to the Equityholder Representative under such
firmÂ’s engagement agreement sufficient for such firm to take direction from
the Equityholder Representative, or otherwise ensuring that the Equityholder
Representative will have access to (and the ability to direct, even if
indirectly through the Surviving Corporation) such firm.

 



 

6.8.4. Parent and the Equityholders shall each pay, or cause to be paid, fifty
percent (50%) of the amount of any documentary, sales, use, real property
transfer, real property gains, registration, value-added, transfer, stamp,
recording, and other similar Taxes, fees, and costs, together with all
interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, additions to Tax and other
additional amounts with respect thereto (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), which may be
imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent shall timely file any Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

6.9. _R andW Policy_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall obtain a
buyer-side representations and warranties insurance policy from Ambridge
Partners, Euclid Transactional, LLC, Ironshore Insurance Services LLC and
Berskhire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (the " _R andW Insurance Policy_")
substantially in the form provided to the Company prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, insuring Parent for Losses due to breaches of
representations and warranties of the Company under _Section 4_ of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the RandW Insurance Policy is not
a condition to the Closing and that Parent and Merger Sub shall remain
obligated, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.3_ , to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the RandW Insurance Policy shall
not to its knowledge, materially impede or delay, or threaten to materially
impede or delay, the Closing.

 



 

6.10. _Expenses_. Except as set forth otherwise herein, all fees and expenses
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the negotiation,
documentation, or consummation of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of counsel, financial
advisors, and independent accountants, shall be borne by Parent. Except as set
forth otherwise herein, all out of pocket fees and expenses incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the negotiation,

 



      
 

 



 

documentation, or consummation of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of counsel, financial
advisors, and independent accountants, shall be included in the Equityholder
Transaction Expenses.

 



 

6.11. _Financial Information_.

 



 

6.11.1. Following the date hereof and continuing through the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare within twenty-one (21) days of the end of each month an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the related unaudited,
consolidated statement of income and cash flows of the Company for such month
(collectively, each month, the " _Post-signing Interim Financials_ "),
together with a full reconciliation to GAAP including all supporting details
as at the date of such Post-signing Interim Financials prepared using the
Accounting Principles and within twenty-one (21) days of the end of each such
month shall deliver such Post-signing Interim Financials, together with such
reconciliation, to Parent. The Post-signing Interim Financials shall be
prepared (a) in a manner consistent with Schedule 4.6.2 and shall include a
description of the Accounting Principles that underlie the development of the
Post-signing Interim Financials on a GAAP basis with the exception of Deferred
Income Taxes and Contingent Consideration attributable to the Bain Capital
Transaction and (b) on the basis of information derived in good faith from the
Books and Records, which shall be maintained in the ordinary course of
business.

 



 

6.11.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a partyÂ’s good faith
failure to comply with this _Section 6.11_ shall not provide the other party
hereto or any of such other partyÂ’s Affiliates with a right not to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each case, to the
extent that any other provision of this Agreement would independently provide
such right.

 



 

6.12. _Stockholder Approval_. The Company shall, immediately following the
execution hereof, use best efforts to obtain the Stockholder Approval within
one (1) Business Day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



 

6.13. _280G_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
a waiver of the right to receive payments and/or benefits that reasonably
could constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder (a " _Parachute Payment Waiver_ ") from
each person who would be a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) and who
reasonably might otherwise receive, have received, or have the right or
entitlement to receive any payment or benefit that would, absent shareholder
approval, be excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code, and the
Company shall have delivered each such Parachute Payment Waiver to Parent on
or before the date on which the shareholder vote pursuant to the immediately
following sentence is conducted. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary to conduct a
shareholder vote in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of
the Code and Treasury Regulations section 1.280G-1, QandA with respect to any
and all payments and/or benefits subject to a Parachute Payment Waiver that,
in the absence of the executed Parachute Payment Waivers by the affected
persons above, might otherwise result, separately or in the aggregate, in the
payment of any amount and/or the provision of any benefit that would not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or that would be subject to
an excise tax by reason of Section 4999 of the Code. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to the Parent written certification setting
forth the results of any shareholder vote. Any form of Parachute Payment
Waiver, disclosure statement and shareholder consent prepared by the Company
and used in connection with any shareholder vote shall be provided to Parent
at least five (5) Business Days in advance of distribution to the disqualified
individuals or Stockholders, as applicable, and Parent shall be provided with
a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon and the Company shall consider any
reasonable comments with respect to the same as are provided by Parent. The
parties acknowledge that this _Section 6.13_ shall not apply to any

 



      
 

 



 

arrangements entered into at the discretion of Parent or between Parent and
its Affiliates, on one hand, and a disqualified individual, on the other hand
(" _Parent Arrangements_ "), with respect to the period following the Closing,
unless such Parent Arrangements have been disclosed to the Company at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, so that, for the avoidance
of doubt, compliance with this _Section 6.13_ shall be determined as if such
Parent Arrangements that are not so disclosed had not been entered into.

 



 

6.14. _Director Resignations_. The Company shall cause to be delivered duly
executed resignations from each director of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries effective as of the Effective Time.

 



 

6.15. _Payments. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall reimburse Parent for (1) one-half of the filing fee payable in
connection with the _notification and report form required under the HSR Act,
_and (2) _an amount equal to the sum of ten percent (10%) of the premium of
the RandW Insurance Policy, plus all costs and expenses payable to the broker
and underwriters associated with obtaining and binding the RandW Insurance
Policy, by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by Parent _. For
the avoidance of doubt, each of the foregoing amounts shall constitute
Equityholder Transaction Expenses._

reasonable efforts to collect the maximum recoverable amount under any
applicable Indemnity Arrangement in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any indemnifiable Loss. In the event that any Loss is actually
indemnified pursuant to this _Section 9_ and, thereafter, recovery by the
Indemnified Party is made in connection with such Loss from an Indemnity
Arrangement, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying
Party the amount of such recovery up to the amount of indemnification actually
received for such Loss.

Taxes actually realized in the year such Losses occurred by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Losses in the year such

Party which may give rise to a claim for indemnification under this _Section
9_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party shall give
reasonably prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that
no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying
Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this
_Section 9_, unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall have the
right at any time to control the defense and resolution of any Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , that an Indemnifying Party shall not affect the settlement
of any Third Party Claim without the prior, written consent of the Indemnified

culpability or wrongful failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense and resolution

Indemnifying Party and provide the Indemnifying Party (upon the Indemnifying
PartyÂ’s request and at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense) with reasonable
access to all information, Persons and documents reasonably necessary to
defend or prosecute such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has not
assumed control of the defense and resolution of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall control the defense and resolution of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , that no Indemnified Party shall effect the settlement of
any Third Party Claim without the prior, written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

9.6. _Escrow Matters_. If and to the extent that any Parent Indemnified Person

any liability or obligation whatsoever with respect to the indemnification
rights of the Parent Indemnified Persons set forth herein, such rights to be
satisfied solely from any funds then remaining in the Escrow Account. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Equityholder Indemnified Person,
other Nonparty Affiliate or any other Person shall have any obligation to fund

Escrow Agent to release in accordance with this _Section 9.6_ all amounts
then remaining in the Escrow Account above an amount equal to the difference
of (x) $7,150,000, _less_ (y) any amounts that have been paid to the Parent
Indemnified Persons from the Escrow Account in connection with a resolved
Indemnity Claim pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(a)_; _provided_ , that in the
event that at such time there are any Indemnity Claims pursuant to _Section
9.2.1(b)_ then pending and unresolved and which would be paid from the Escrow
Account, the Escrow Agent shall retain funds sufficient to pay such Indemnity
Claims as and when resolved, and upon resolution of any such Indemnity Claim
after the First Escrow Release Date and after giving effect to any payment to
the Parent Indemnified Persons in connection therewith, shall release such
remaining withheld funds with respect to such Indemnity Claims in accordance
with this _Section 9.6_. Promptly following the Survival Date, and in any
case within three (3) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the Equityholder
Representative shall deliver joint, written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to release in accordance with this _Section 9.6_ all amounts then remaining
in the Escrow Account; _provided_ , that in the event that at such time there
are any Indemnity Claims then pending and unresolved and which would be paid

such Indemnity Claims as and when resolved ( _provided_ , that the total funds
retained in the Escrow Account in accordance with this proviso with respect to
Indemnity Claims pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(a)_ shall not, in any event,
exceed an amount equal to the difference of (x) $7,150,000, _less_ (y) any
amounts that have been paid to the Parent Indemnified Persons from the Escrow
Account in connection with a resolved Indemnity Claim pursuant to _Section
9.2.1(a)_), and upon resolution of any Indemnity Claim after the Survival Date
and after giving effect to any payment to the Parent Indemnified Persons in
connection therewith, shall release such remaining withheld funds with respect
to such Indemnity Claims in accordance with this _Section 9.6_. All funds
released pursuant to this _Section 9.6_ or otherwise from the Escrow Account
shall be distributed (i) to the Payments Administrator to be distributed to
the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares and (ii)
to the Surviving Corporation to be distributed to the Optionholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares through the Surviving
CorporationÂ’s payroll system in accordance with _Section 3.2.4_ but not later

and payable.

 



 

9.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as set forth in _Section 10.11_, _Section
10.15_ (solely with respect to the Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s rights to
indemnification from the Equityholders), or in the case of claims for fraud,
each party hereby acknowledges and agrees that the sole and exclusive remedy
of the parties following the Closing with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement set forth in this Agreement
or any other matter arising in whole or in part under or in connection with
this Agreement, the negotiation, terms, and performance hereof, the rights of
the parties hereunder, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity,
or otherwise, shall be indemnification in accordance with this _Section 9_
and the RandW Insurance Policy. In connection therewith, except in the case of
claims for fraud, each of the parties hereby agrees to waive, and that they
shall not assert, any other remedy following the Closing, whether arising at
law or in equity, for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement set forth in this Agreement or any other matter arising in whole or
in part under or in connection with this Agreement, the negotiation, terms,
and performance hereof, the rights of the parties hereunder, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as set forth in _Section 10.11_ or
_Section 10.15_ (solely with respect to the Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s
rights to indemnification from the Equityholders). The parties hereto agree
that the provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the
limits imposed on remedies with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including this _Section 9.7_ and _Sections 9.2.2_ ,
_9.4_ , _9.6_ and _10.1_ ), constitute an integral part of the consideration
given to the Equityholders, were specifically

 



      
 

 



 

bargained for between sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into
account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to the Equityholders
hereunder.

 



 

9.8. _Materiality_. In all cases in determining whether there has been a
breach of a representation or warranty by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
for the purposes of this _Section 9_ (other than those representations and
warranties set forth in the last sentence of _Section 4.6.2_, _Sections
4.8(b)_ , the first sentence of _4.10.1_ , _4.11.1_ , _4.11.3_ , _4.13.1_ ,
_4.13.2_ , _4.13.3_ , the second sentence of _4.14.2_ , _4.17.2_ and the first

to a breach of a representation or warranty by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company for the purposes of this _Section 9_ (other than the representation
and warranty set forth in _Section 4.8(b)_), the applicable representations
and warranties shall be read without regard to any materiality qualifier
(including any reference to Material Adverse Effect) contained therein (
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that no dollar thresholds contained
in any representations or warranties shall be disregarded for these purposes).

 



 

9.9. _Tax Treatment_. All indemnification and other payments under this
_Section 9_ shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
be treated for Tax purposes as adjustments to the proceeds received by the
Stockholders pursuant to _Section 3_. None of the parties shall take any
position on any Tax Return, or before any Governmental Authority, that is
inconsistent with such treatment.

validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision hereof
would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable in any
respect, each party hereto intends that such provision shall be construed by
modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum
extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Legal Requirements and
to otherwise give effect to the intent of the parties.

 



 

10.8. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience
purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation
hereof.

 



       
 

 



 

10.9. _Construction_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

10.10. _Company Disclosure Letter_. The Company Disclosure Letter shall be
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement for the
convenience of the parties, and the disclosure of an item in one section of
the Company Disclosure Letter as an exception to a particular representation
or warranty in _Section 4_ of this Agreement shall be deemed adequately
disclosed as an exception with respect to all representations and warranties
in _Section 4_ of this Agreement to the extent that the relevance of such
item to such other representations or warranties is reasonably apparent. The
Company Disclosure Letter is not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations and warranties of the Company. The
inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter is not intended to
imply that such item is or is not material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or is within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and
no Person may use the fact of the inclusion of any item in the Company
Disclosure Letter in any dispute or controversy involving such Person as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not included in the Company Disclosure
Letter is or is not material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, or is within
or outside of the ordinary course of business.

 



 

10.11. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that the other parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise were breached or violated. Accordingly, each
of the parties hereto further agrees that, without any requirement for the
posting of any bond or other undertaking and without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, each party hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of
the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement
and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court
specified in _Section 10.13.1_, in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto hereby
acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove damages with
reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure suitable substitute
performance and that an injunction and/or specific performance will not cause
an undue hardship to the parties. Each of parties hereto further acknowledges
and agrees that the existence of any other remedy contemplated by this
Agreement does not diminish the availability of an injunction or specific
performance. Each party hereto further agrees that, in the event of any Action
for an injunction or specific performance in respect of any such threatened or
actual breach or violation, they shall not assert that a remedy at law would
be adequate, that the party seeking relief would not be irreparably harmed
absent such relief, or that an injunction or specific performance should not
be available on the grounds that money damages are adequate or any other
grounds.

 



 

10.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the negotiation, terms, and
performance hereof, the rights of the parties hereunder, and all Actions
arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 



 

10.13. _Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process_.

 



 

10.13.1. _Jurisdiction_. Each party to this Agreement, by their execution
hereof, hereby irrevocably (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if but only if the Court
of Chancery declines jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, for the
purpose of

 



      
 

 



 

any Action between any of the parties hereto arising in whole or in part under
or in connection with this Agreement, the negotiation, terms, and performance
hereof, the rights of the parties hereunder, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Legal Requirements, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense
or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that they are not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that venue in such
courts is improper, that their property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that any such Action brought in the above-named courts should be
dismissed on grounds of _forum non conveniens_ or improper venue, that
(subject to clause (a) above) such Action should be transferred or removed to
any court other than the above-named courts, that such Action should be stayed
by reason of the pendency of some other Action in any other court other than
the above-named courts or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may
not be enforced in or by such courts, and (c) agrees not to commence or
prosecute any such Action other than before the above-named courts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party hereto may commence any Action in a
court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an
order or judgment issued by the above-named courts.

 



 

10.13.2. _Service of Process_. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably (a)
consents to service of process in any Action between any of the parties hereto
arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, the
negotiation, terms, and performance hereof, the rights of the parties
hereunder, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any manner
permitted by Delaware law, (b) agrees that service of process made in
accordance with clause (a) or made by overnight delivery by a nationally
recognized courier service at their address specified pursuant to _Section
10.2_ shall constitute good and valid service of process in any such Action,
and (c) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise) in any such Action any claim that service of process made in
accordance with clause (a) or (b) does not constitute good and valid service
of process.

 



 

10.14. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE, AND
COVENANT THAT THEY SHALL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT, OR
OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN
PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE NEGOTIATION, TERMS, AND
PERFORMANCE HEREOF, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER, OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR
OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
_SECTION 10.14_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY,
AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO. THE PARTIES HERETO
FURTHER AGREE TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING AND ANY SUCH PROCEEDING SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

 



 

10.15. _Equityholder Representative_.

 



 

10.15.1. As an integral component of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Merger, the Equityholder Representative is hereby
irrevocably constituted, appointed, authorized, directed and empowered,
effective as of the Effective Time, to act as sole and exclusive agent,
attorney-in-fact and representative of the Equityholders, with full power of
substitution, for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and each
agreement ancillary hereto.

 



 

10.15.2. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholder
Representative hereunder will constitute a decision, act, consent or
instruction of all Equityholders and will be final, binding and conclusive
upon each of such Equityholders, and the Escrow Agent, Payments

 



      
 

 



 

Administrator, Parent, Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholder Representative
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such
Equityholder.

 



 

10.15.3. The Equityholder Representative will have the right to recover, at
its sole discretion, from the Representative Fund Amount (such amounts in the
account, at any given time, the " _Representative Fund_ "), prior to any
distribution to the Equityholders, (i) the Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s out-
of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel, accountants or
other agents or experts) incurred in serving in that capacity and (ii) any
amounts to which it is entitled pursuant to the indemnification provision in
_Section 10.15.5_. In the event the amount of the Representative Fund
available to satisfy Representative Expenses (the " _Remaining Fund Property_
") is insufficient to satisfy all Representative Expenses, then each
Equityholder will be obligated to pay the Representative Expenses in excess of
the Remaining Fund Property (or, at the election of the Equityholder
Representative, such excess amount may be deducted from any release to such
Equityholders from the Escrow Amount). Any release of the Representative Fund
shall be made (i) to the Payments Administrator to be distributed to the
Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares and (ii) to
the Surviving Corporation to be distributed to the Optionholders in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares through the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
payroll system in accordance with _Section 3.2.4_ but not later than thirty
days following the date or dates on which any amount becomes due and payable.
The Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Representative Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Equityholder
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Equityholder Representative will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Representative Fund other than as a result of
its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Equityholder Representative
will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these
funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. For Tax purposes, the Representative Fund will be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Equityholders at the
time of Closing.

 



 

10.15.4. In connection with this Agreement, and any instrument, agreement or
document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise
all or any of the powers conferred upon the Equityholder Representative
hereunder, (i) the Equityholder Representative shall incur no responsibility
or liability whatsoever to any of the Equityholders by reason of any error in
judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or any such
other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any
act or failure to act which represents gross negligence or willful misconduct,
(ii) the Equityholder Representative shall not be liable to the Equityholders
for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Equityholder
Representative in good faith, and (iii) the Equityholder Representative shall
be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in
judgment or other act or omission of the Equityholder Representative pursuant
to such advice shall in no event subject the Equityholder Representative to
liability to any of the Equityholders.

 



 

10.15.5. Each Equityholder shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Equityholder Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Expenses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s execution and performance of this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Expense is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event
that any such Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the gross negligence or

 



      
 

 



 

willful misconduct of the Equityholder Representative, the Equityholder
Representative will reimburse the Equityholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Equityholder Representative by
the Equityholders, any such Representative Expenses may be recovered by the
Equityholder Representative from (i) the Representative Fund Amount, (ii) any
funds from the Escrow Amount at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise
be distributable to the Equityholders; provided, that while this section
allows the Equityholder Representative to be paid from the Representative Fund
Amount and the Escrow Amount, this does not relieve the Equityholders from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Expenses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Equityholder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Equityholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the Equityholders or otherwise. Any restrictions or limitations on indemnity
or liability set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Equityholder Representative in
this paragraph. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Equityholder Representative or the termination
of this Agreement.

 



 

10.15.6. The Equityholder Representative may be removed at any time by written
consent of a majority-in-interest of the Equityholders. In the event that the
Equityholder Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue in its
capacity as Equityholder Representative, or if the Equityholder Representative
resigns as the Equityholder Representative, a majority-in-interest of the
Equityholders may, by written consent, appoint a new representative as the
Equityholder Representative. Notice and a copy of any written consent removing
such existing representative or appointing such new representative and bearing
the signatures of a majority-in-interest of the Equityholders must be
delivered to Parent and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent and Payments
Administrator. Such removal or appointment will be effective upon the later of
the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by
Parent and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent and Payments Administrator. For
the purposes of this _Section 10.15_, a "majority-in-interest of the
Equityholders" means Equityholders representing in the aggregate a Pro Rata
Share of greater than 50%.

 



 

10.15.7. Following the Closing, any payments to be made to the Stockholders at
any time that the Payments Agreement is not in effect shall be made to such
Stockholders as directed by the Equityholder Representative.

 



 

10.15.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
or any Escrow Agreement, no Equityholder shall have any right to, or any
interest or claim relating to the Escrow Amount or Representative Fund unless
and until it has been finally determined in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement that such funds or other
property are to be distributed to such Equityholder in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable.

 



 

10.16. _Waiver of Conflicts_. Ropes and Gray LLP has acted as legal counsel to
the Company, its Subsidiaries and certain of the Stockholders prior to the
Closing with respect to various matters, including the transactions
contemplated hereby and by acting as legal counsel to certain of the
Stockholders with respect to their investment in the Company, and may continue
following the Closing to represent certain of the Stockholders with respect to
various matters, including the transactions contemplated hereby and by acting
as legal counsel to certain of the Stockholders with respect to their
investment in the Company. Each of the parties hereto, on behalf of themselves
and each of their respective Affiliates, hereby waives any conflicts of
interest that may arise in connection with the representation by Ropes and Gray
LLP of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of the Stockholders with respect
to any matters which have already occurred or which may arise in the future,
including the transactions contemplated hereby and by acting as

 



      
 

 



 

legal counsel to certain of the Stockholders with respect to their investment
in the Company. All communications which involve attorney-client confidences
and which have arisen or may arise in the future between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Ropes and Gray LLP, on the other hand and
which involve the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be confidences which
belong solely to the Equityholder Representative, and no other Person shall
have any access thereto. Furthermore, all communications which involve
attorney-client confidences and which have arisen or may arise in the future
with respect to any representation by Ropes and Gray LLP of any Stockholder with
respect to such StockholderÂ’s investment in the Company (including any which
may have arisen or which may in the future arise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby) shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to such Stockholder, and no other Person shall
have any access thereto. No term of this _Section 10.16_ may be amended,
waived or modified without the prior written consent of Ropes and Gray LLP.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, on
the one hand, and a third party (other than an Equityholder or its
Affiliates), on the other hand, after the Closing, Parent (including,
effective as of the Closing, on behalf of Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their Affiliates) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Ropes and Gray
LLP to such third party; provided, that, neither Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company nor any of their Affiliates may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Equityholder
Representative.

 



 

10.17. _Ultimate Parent Undertaking_. Ultimate Parent hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees, as principal and not as surety, to cause the prompt
and full discharge by Parent of all of ParentÂ’s payment obligations under this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Parent Obligations_ "), in accordance with the
terms hereof. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Parent Obligations are
the joint and several obligations of Parent and Ultimate Parent. If Parent
shall default in the due and punctual performance of any Parent Obligation,
Ultimate Parent will forthwith make or cause to be made full payment of any
amount due with respect thereto at its sole cost and expense. Ultimate Parent
hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5_,
_mutatis mutandis_ , as if it were Parent hereunder. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Ultimate Parent is a party to
this Agreement solely with respect to this _Section 10.17_ and shall have no
other obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement.
