    reinsuring the Tail Policy shall become insolvent or otherwise
    financially distressed such that any of them is reasonably
    likely to be unable to satisfy its financial obligations under
    the Tail Policy at any time during the term thereof, Parent
    agrees that it shall, from time to time, cause the Tail Policy
    to be replaced with another prepaid &#147;tail&#148; policy on
    terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits
