   AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  



  

  This Agreement and  Plan of Merger (" _Agreement_ ") is made  and entered
into as of June 30, 2011, by and among:  Bulldog Holdings, LLC,  a Delaware
limited liability company  (" _Parent_ ");  Bulldog Acquisition  Sub, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned  subsidiary of Parent ("
_Acquisition Sub_ "); and  Blackboard  Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  "
_Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in  this Agreement are defined
in _Exhibit A_. 

  



  

   Recitals 

  



  

  A. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have determined  that it is in
the best interests of their respective  stockholders for Parent to acquire
the Company upon the terms  and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. 

  



  

  B. In furtherance of the contemplated acquisition of the  Company by
Parent, it is proposed that Acquisition Sub merge  with and into the Company
upon the terms and subject to the  conditions set forth in this Agreement
(the merger of  Acquisition Sub into the Company being referred to in this 
Agreement as the " _Merger_ "). 

  



  

  C. The board of managers of Parent and the respective  boards of directors
of Acquisition Sub and the Company have  unanimously authorized and approved
the execution and delivery  of this Agreement and the performance of their
respective  obligations under this Agreement. 

  



  

  D. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this  Agreement, and as
a condition to the willingness of the Company  to enter into this Agreement,
each of Providence Equity Partners  VI L.P., a limited partnership organized
under the laws of the  State of Delaware, and Providence Equity Partners VI-A
L.P., a  limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of 
Delaware (each, a " _Guarantor_ " and collectively,  the " _Guarantors_ ") is
entering into and  delivering to the Company a guarantee in favor of the
Company  (the " _Guarantee_ ") with respect to the matters  set forth
therein. 

  



  

   Agreement 

  



  

  The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound,  agree as
follows: 

  



  

  Section 1 _THE  MERGER; EFFECTIVE TIME_  

  



  

  1.1 _Merger of Acquisition Sub into the  Company._ Upon the terms and
subject to the  conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance
with  the Delaware General Corporation Law (the  " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Acquisition Sub  shall be merged with and into the Company,
and the separate  existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease. The Company
will  continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the  " _Surviving
Corporation_ "), and the separate  corporate existence of the Company, with
all of its rights,  privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall
continue  unaffected by the Merger. 

  



  

  1.2 _Effect of the Merger._ The  Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and in  the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

  



  

  1.3 _Effective Time._ On the later of  (a) the date two business days
after the earliest date as  of which each of the conditions set forth in 
_Section 5_ has been satisfied or waived (other than  the conditions set
forth in _Section 5.2(c)_ and  _Section 5.3(c)_, which by their nature are to
be  satisfied at Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver  of each
of such conditions at Closing), and (b) the final  day of the Marketing
Period, the parties hereto shall cause a  properly executed certificate of
merger in customary form and  conforming to the requirements of the DGCL
(the  " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed with the  Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall  become effective at the time the
Certificate of Merger is filed  with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such  later time as may be jointly designated by Parent and
the  Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at  which
the Merger becomes effective being referred to in this  Agreement as the "
_Effective Time_ "). At  10:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on the date on which the 
Certificate of Merger is required to be so filed (the  " _Required Closing
Date_ "), a closing shall be  held at the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  offices of Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP, 1101 New York Avenue,  NW, Washington,
D.C. (or at such other place or time as  Parent and the Company may jointly
designate) for the purpose of  confirming the satisfaction or waiver of each
of the conditions  set forth in _Section 5_ and initiating the payment 
referred to in the second sentence of _Section 1.7(a)_  (the " _Closing_
"). 

  



  

  1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws;  Directors and Officers._ At
the Effective Time,  unless otherwise jointly determined by Parent and the
Company  prior to the Effective Time: 

  



  

  (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving  Corporation shall
be amended and restated to conform to  _Exhibit B_; 

  



  

  (b) subject to _Section 4.13(a)_, the Bylaws of  the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated to  conform to the Bylaws of Acquisition Sub as
in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time; 

  



  

  (c) the individuals who were directors of Acquisition Sub  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become the  directors of the Surviving
Corporation; and 

  



  

  (d) the individuals who were officers of the Company  immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become the  officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

  1.5 _Conversion of Company  Shares._ Subject to _Section 1.8_, at  the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any  action on the part
of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or  any holder of Company Shares: 

  



  

  (a) any Company Shares held by the Company or any wholly  owned Subsidiary
of the Company (or held in the Companys  treasury) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall  (i) cease to be outstanding, (ii) cease to exist, and 
(iii) be cancelled and retired, and no consideration shall  be paid in
exchange therefor; 

  



  

  (b) any Company Shares held by Parent, Acquisition Sub or  any other
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent  immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall (i) cease to  be outstanding, (ii) cease to exist,
and (iii) be  cancelled and retired, and no consideration shall be paid in 
exchange therefor; 

  



  

  (c) except as provided in clauses "(a)" and  "(b)" above, and subject to
_Section 4.11_,  each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to  the Effective Time that is not an Appraisal Share shall be  converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to  $45.00 (the " _Per
Share Amount_ "); and 

  



  

  (d) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,  of Acquisition
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of the  common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

  Without limiting or affecting the covenants in  _Section 4.1_, if, between
the date of this Agreement  and the Effective Time, the outstanding Company
Shares are  changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of 
any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock  dividend, reverse
stock split, combination, exchange or  readjustment of shares, consolidation
of shares,  reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction,  then the Per Share Amount payable pursuant to  _Section
1.5(c)_ or used in calculating any amounts  payable pursuant to _Section 1.9_
or  _Section 4.11_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect  such change. 

  



  

  1.6 _Closing of the Company s Transfer  Books._ At the Effective Time:
(a) all  Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist;  (b) all holders of valid
certificates previously  representing Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time (" _Certificates_ "),  and all
holders of non-certificated Company Shares represented  by a book-entry that
were outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), shall  cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company;
and  (c) each such Company Share shall, subject to  _Section 1.8_, represent
the right to receive, upon  the surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share previously  representing such Company Share in accordance with 
_Section 1.7_, the Per Share Amount, plus any unpaid  dividends with a record
date prior to the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Effective Time payable with respect to such Company Share. At  the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company  shall be closed with
respect to all Company Shares that were  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. No further  transfer of any such Company Shares shall be made
on such stock  transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective  Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share previously 
representing any of such Company Shares is surrendered to the  Paying Agent
or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such  Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be canceled and shall be  exchanged as provided in _Section 1.7._
In the event  there was a transfer of ownership of any Company Share prior
to  the Effective Time and such transfer shall not have been  registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Per Share  Amount payable in respect
of such Company Share shall be paid to  the transferee of such Company Share
if the Certificate or  Book-Entry Share that previously represented such
Company Share  is surrendered to the Paying Agent accompanied by all
documents  required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence 
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid, in each  case, in
form reasonably acceptable to Parent. 

  



  

  1.7 _Payment for Company Shares._  

  



  

  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent (after consultation  with and
approval of the Company) shall select a reputable bank  or trust company to
act as paying agent with respect to the  Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At
or immediately  following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be paid
to  the Paying Agent, in cash, an amount sufficient to enable the  Paying
Agent to make all payments required to be made pursuant  to _Section 1.5_ to
holders of Company Shares  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such cash  amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Until used for  that
purpose, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying  Agent (i) in
short term obligations of or guaranteed by the  United States of America or
short-term obligations of an agency  of the United States of America that are
backed by the full  faith and credit of the United States of America, (ii)
in  commercial paper obligations rated  A-1 or  P-1 or  better by Moodys
Investors Services Inc. or  Standard and Poors Corporation, or (iii) in 
deposit accounts, short-term certificates of deposit, bank  repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial  banks which have capital,
surplus and undivided profits  aggregating more than $10 billion (based on
the most recent  financial statements of such commercial banks that are
then  publicly available at the SEC or otherwise);  __provided__ ,
__however__ , that no such  investment, and no losses thereon, shall reduce
or otherwise  affect the amounts payable to former holders of Company
Shares,  and Parent shall cause to be promptly provided to the Paying  Agent
additional funds for the benefit of such former holders of  Company Shares in
the amount of any such losses and shall  otherwise ensure that the Paying
Agent has, as and when needed,  amounts sufficient in the aggregate to
provide all funds  necessary for the Paying Agent to make the payments
required to  be made pursuant to _Section 1.5_ to the former  holders of

upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by  the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or  destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the  posting of a bond in customary and reasonable
amount as  indemnification against any claim that may be made against it

  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  this Agreement,
any Company Shares that constitute Appraisal  Shares shall not be converted

holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. From  and after the Effective
Time, a holder of Appraisal Shares shall  not have any of the voting rights
or other rights of a  stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. If any holder
of  Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect, shall waive or shall  otherwise
lose such holders right of appraisal under  Section 262 of the DGCL (or a
court of competent  jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to  the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL), then  (i) any
right of such holder to require the Surviving  Corporation to purchase such
Appraisal Shares under  Section 262 of the DGCL shall be extinguished, and 
(ii) such Appraisal Shares shall automatically be converted  into and shall
represent only the right to receive, upon  compliance with _Section 1.7_,
payment for such shares  in accordance with _Section 1.5._ 

  



  

  (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of  any written demand
received by the Company from any holder of  Company Shares for appraisal of
such holders Company  Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, any

pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the  Company relating to
Company Stockholders rights of  appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all  negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand.  The Company shall not make any voluntary payment with respect to 
any demands for appraisal or settle any such demands for  appraisal without
the prior written consent of Parent. 

  



  

  (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term  " _Appraisal Shares_ "

Time that are  held by stockholders who have properly preserved their

Effective  Time (each, an " _Outstanding Option_ ") shall be  converted into
the right to receive, after the Effective Time,  in exchange for the
cancellation of such Outstanding Option, an  amount in cash, without
interest, equal to (A) the amount,  if any, by which (1) the Per Share Amount
exceeds  (2) the per share exercise price of such Outstanding  Option,
_multiplied by_ (B) the number of Company  Shares subject to such Outstanding
Option immediately prior to  the Effective Time (it being understood that, if
the per 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  share exercise price of an Outstanding Option equals or exceeds  the Per
Share Amount, then such Company Option shall be  cancelled and terminated at
the Effective Time without payment  or consideration therefor and the holder
of such Company Option  shall have no rights whatsoever with respect
thereto); 

  



  

  (ii) except as otherwise set forth in a written agreement  entered into
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the  Effective Time between the
Parent or its Affiliates, the Company  and a holder of restricted Company
Shares, (A) any Company  Shares that constitute unvested restricted stock of
the Company  as of the Effective Time shall be subject to twelve months of 
accelerated vesting in accordance with the terms of the  applicable Company
Equity Plan and award agreement, except that  any holder not a member of the
Surviving Corporations  Leadership Team (as set forth on Part 1.9(a)(ii) of
the  Disclosure Schedule) shall have all unvested shares of  restricted

immediately prior to the Effective Time (each,  an " _Outstanding Company
Restricted Stock Unit_ ")  shall be converted into the right to receive,
after the  Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such 
Outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit, an amount in cash,  without
interest, equal to (A) the Per Share Amount,  _multiplied by_ (B) the number
of Company Shares  subject to such Outstanding Company Restricted Stock
Unit  immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

  



  

  (iv) any Company Shares representing restricted stock held  by Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any other direct or indirect  wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall become fully vested

consideration otherwise  payable to the holders of Company Shares,
Outstanding Options,  Accelerated Company Shares and Outstanding Company
Restricted  Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement such taxes as it is 
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of  such payment
under the Code. To the extent that amounts are so  deducted and withheld by
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or  the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such deducted and withheld  amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the
Surviving  Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the 
applicable Governmental Entity within the time and in the manner  required by
applicable Legal Requirements and (ii) shall be  treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid  to the holder of such Company Shares,
Outstanding Options,  Accelerated Company Shares and Outstanding Company
Restricted  Stock Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding 
was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent,  as the case
may be.

Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "),
and  all other material employee benefit plans, programs, policies, 
agreements or arrangements or practices, whether written or  oral, whether or
not subject to ERISA, maintained for current or  former directors, officers,
employees or consultants who are  natural persons and who, in each case, are
employed or were  employed by, or provide or have provided services to, the 
Company or any Company Subsidiary exclusively or primarily  within the United
States, in each case, with respect to which  the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any direct or indirect  liability, whether contingent or
otherwise, or which is  maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the
Company or any  Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement or with 
respect to which the Company has any obligation to maintain,  sponsor or
contribute (the " _Company Plans_ ").  Each Company Plan is listed in Part
2.13(a) of the  Disclosure Schedule. 

  



  

  (b) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified  under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable  determination letter (or opinion
letter, if applicable) from the  IRS stating that such Company Plan is so
qualified and the  trusts maintained thereto are exempt from federal income 
taxation under Section 501 of the Code, and, to the  knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts or circumstances  that would reasonably by
expected to cause the loss of such  qualification. 

  



  

  (c) Each Company Plan has been operated in compliance in  all material
respects with its terms and with all applicable  Legal Requirements,
including ERISA and the Code. All  contributions and premiums required by
applicable Legal  Requirements or by the terms of any Company Plan or any 
agreement relating thereto have been timely made (without regard  to any
waivers granted with respect thereto) to any funds or  trusts established
thereunder or in connection therewith. 

  



  

  (d) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries  has incurred
any current or projected liability in respect of  post-employment health,
medical or life insurance benefits for  any current or former employees of
the Company or any Company  Subsidiary, except as may be required under the
Consolidated  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended  ("
_COBRA_ ") and at the former employees  expense. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary nor any  other entity which, together with the Company or
any Company  Subsidiary, would be treated as a single employer under 
Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an  " _ERISA Affiliate_ ")
contributes to or has in the  past six years sponsored, maintained,
contributed to or had any  liability in respect of any defined benefit
pension plan (as  defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) or plan subject to 
Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or  Title IV of ERISA. No
Company Plan is a "multiemployer  plan" within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of  ERISA and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor
any  of their respective ERISA Affiliates has at any time sponsored  or
contributed to, or had any liability or obligation in respect  of, any such
multiemployer plan. 

  



  

  (e) No action or other claim with respect to any Company  Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits) that, individually  or in the aggregate, has
resulted or would reasonably be  expected to result in material liability to
the Company or any  Company Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of
the  Company, threatened. No event has occurred, and to the knowledge  of
the Company, no condition exists that would, directly or by  reason of the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys  affiliation with any of their ERISA
Affiliates, subject the  Company or any Company Subsidiary to any material
tax, fine,  Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or 
other applicable Legal Requirements. Each Company Plan providing  for
deferred compensation that constitutes a "nonqualified  deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in  Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and applicable
regulations)  for any service provider to the Company or any 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Company Subsidiary or their respective ERISA Affiliates  (i) complies in
all material respects with the requirements  of Section 409A of the Code and
the regulations promulgated  thereunder, or (ii) is exempt from compliance
under the  "grandfather" provisions of IRS Notice  2005-1 and  applicable
regulations, and has not been "materially  modified" (within the meaning of
IRS Notice  2005-1 and  Treasury Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) since October 1, 
2004. 

  



  

  (f) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the  consummation of
the Merger (i) will not materially increase  the compensation or benefits
payable by the Company or any  Company Subsidiary under any Company Plan,
(ii) will not  result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of  any material benefits payable by the Company or any Company  Subsidiary
under any Company Plan or otherwise accelerate or  increase any liability of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary  under any Company Plan, (iii) will not
cause or result in  material severance pay or material increase in severance
pay  upon any termination of employment after the date of this  Agreement,
(iv) will not create any limitation or  restriction on the right of the
Company or any Company  Subsidiary or their ERISA Affiliates to merge, amend
or  terminate any Company Plan, and (v) will not result in the  payment of
any amount that could, individually or in combination  with any other such
payment, constitute an "excess  parachute payment," as defined in Section
280G(b)(1)  of the Code. 

  



  

  (g) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in  compliance with all
applicable Legal Requirements relating to  the employment of their employees,
including with respect to  terms and conditions of employment, labor
relations, wages and  hours, equal employment opportunities, fair
employment  practices, immigration and occupational health and safety, 
except where any such failures to be in such compliance,  individually and in
the aggregate, do not and would not have  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No  individual who has performed services for the
Company or any  Company Subsidiary has been improperly excluded from 
participation in any Company Plan, and neither the Company nor  any Company
Subsidiary has any material, direct or indirect  liability, whether actual or
contingent, with respect to any  misclassification of any person as an
independent contractor  rather than as an employee, or as exempt rather than
non-exempt,  or with respect to any employee leased from another employer. 

  



  

  (h) All employee benefit plans which are similar to the  Company Plans
maintained primarily for the benefit of employees  whose services for the
Company or any Company Subsidiary are  exclusively or primarily performed
outside the United States  (i) have been established, maintained and
administered in  material compliance with their terms and all applicable
Legal  Requirements of any controlling Governmental Entity,  (ii) have, to
the extent required, been registered and  maintained in good standing with
the applicable regulatory  authorities, and (iii) are fully funded  and/or
book  reserved, if applicable, based upon reasonable actuarial 
assumptions. 

  



  

  (i) There is no agreement between the Company or any  Company Subsidiary
and any employee or independent contractor of  the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that will give rise to any  material payment that would not be
deductible for  U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to  Section 280G
or Section 162(m) of the Code. 

  



  

  2.14 _Labor Matters._ There are no  collective bargaining agreements or
other labor union agreements  to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party or  bound. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is the 
subject of any Legal Proceeding asserting that it has committed  an unfair
labor practice or seeking to compel it to bargain with  any labor
organization as to wages or conditions. The Company  has made available to
Parent correct and complete copies of all  material correspondence and all
unresolved charges, complaints,  notices or orders received by the Company or
any Company  Subsidiary from the National Labor Relations Board or any
labor  organization since the Applicable Date. Since the Applicable  Date,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has had a  National Labor
Relations Board unfair labor practice charge or  representation petition
filed against it. Except as would not  have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has had  any actual or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened 
strike, slowdown, work stoppage, boycott, picketing, lockout,  job action or
union labor dispute since the Applicable Date  (other than routine contract
negotiations). There has not been a  "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as
defined  by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  1988 and any similar foreign, state or local laws) with respect  to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary within the six  (6) months preceding the
date of this Agreement. 

  



  

  2.15 _Environmental Matters._ The  Company and the Company Subsidiaries
are, and since the  Applicable Date have been, in compliance with all
applicable  Environmental Laws, except where any failure to be in such 
compliance would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a  Material
Adverse Effect. Between the Applicable Date and the  date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any Company  Subsidiary has been subject to any
pending or, to the  Companys knowledge, threatened Legal Proceeding under
any  Environmental Law, or has received any written notice from a 
Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company or any Company  Subsidiary
is in material violation of any Environmental Law,  except for any notice
that has been withdrawn or any violation  that has been cured or remedied in
all material respects. During  the two year period prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the  knowledge of the Company, there has been no material
release of  any hazardous materials by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary  at or from any facilities owned or leased by the Company or any 
Company Subsidiary for which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary has any
material liability. For purposes of this  _Section 2.15_, " _Environmental
Law_ "  means any Legal Requirement relating to pollution or protection  of
the environment, including any such Legal Requirement  regulating emissions,
discharges or releases of pollutants,  contaminants, wastes and toxic
substances. 

  



  

  2.16 _Insurance._ Except as would not  have a Material Adverse Effect, (a)
the Company and the  Company Subsidiaries own or hold policies of insurance,
or are  self-insured, in amounts providing reasonably adequate coverage 
against all risks customarily insured against by companies in  similar lines
of business as the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries, and (b) all such
material insurance policies  are in full force and effect. Between the
Balance Sheet Date and  the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any Company  Subsidiary has received any written communication notifying

invalidation of any material insurance policy  held by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (except with  respect to policies that have been replaced
with similar  policies), (ii) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any 
material claim under any material insurance policy held by the  Company or
any Company Subsidiary, or (iii) material  adjustment in the amount of the
premiums payable with respect to  any material insurance policy held by the

is no  pending material claim by the Company against any insurance  carrier
under any insurance policy held by the Company or any  Company Subsidiary.

obligations under this Agreement. On or prior to the date  hereof, the board

default  under, any of the Commitment Letters or Definitive Financing

not be able to satisfy on a timely basis each term and  condition relating to

closing or funding of any portion of  the Financing not to be met or complied
with, or  (3) otherwise cause the full amount (or any portion) of the  funds
contemplated to be available under the Commitment Letters  to not be
available to Parent and Acquisition Sub on a timely  basis; and (z) know of
no potential impediment to the  funding of any of the payment obligations of
Parent or  Acquisition Sub under this Agreement.

amount (or any portion) of  the Financing, including any condition or other
contingency  relating to the availability of any "market flex"  provisions,

  (e) Assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the  representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in  _Section 2.3_ of this Agreement
at the Required  Closing Date (provided that if one or more inaccuracies in
the  representations set forth in the first, second and fifth  sentences of

amounts payable pursuant to _Section 1.7_,  _Section 1.9_ or _Section 4.11_

material for purposes of this sentence) and performance by the  Company in

instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to  cause its Representatives
not to: 

  



  

  (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by  way of

accordance  with its terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or 
under any applicable Takeover Statute (in each case, other than  to Parent or
Acquisition Sub) in order to permit the making of  an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal, unless the Companys  board of directors determines in good faith
(after consultation  with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that the  failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be 
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal  Requirements.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in  this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from granting (without  the permission of Parent or
Acquisition Sub) a consent or waiver  under any nondisclosure provision of
confidentiality agreement  in order to permit the other party thereto or any
of such other  partys Representatives to disclose any information in such 
partys possession as of the date of this Agreement to  (a) any Affiliate of
such other party, (b) any  existing or prospective investor or financing

Company. The Company shall  immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation,  encouragement (including by way of providing access to  non-
public information), discussions or negotiations with any  Person conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement by the  Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company or Representatives  thereof with respect to any actual or potential
Alternative  Acquisition Proposal and request that all non-public
information  provided to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any 
Subsidiaries or Representatives of the Company in connection  with such
solicitation, encouragement, discussions or  negotiations be returned or
destroyed. 

  



  

  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to  obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company  has received a written inquiry
or Alternative Acquisition  Proposal that the Companys board 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  of directors or any committee thereof determines in good faith  to be bona
fide, (ii) the Companys board of directors  or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after  consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal  counsel, that such inquiry or Alternative Acquisition
Proposal  constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a 
Superior Proposal, (iii) the Companys board of  directors or any committee
thereof determines in good faith,  after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal  counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably  be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under  applicable Legal Requirements and (iv) such inquiry or  Alternative
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material  breach of this _Section
4.2_ by the Company, any  Company Subsidiary or any of the Companys
Representatives,  then the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives
may  (A) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding  such inquiry
or Alternative Acquisition Proposal with the Person  or group of Persons
making such inquiry or Alternative  Acquisition Proposal and with any
Representative or Affiliate  of, and any potential financing source for, such
Person or group  of Persons and (B) provide the Person or group of Persons 
making such inquiry or Alternative Acquisition Proposal, and any 
Representative or Affiliate of or potential source of financing  for such
Person or group of Persons, any non-public or other  information regarding
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company  or any other matter; __provided_
, _however_ ,  _that (1) prior to engaging in any such discussions or 
negotiations with such Person or group of Persons or their  Representatives
concerning, or providing any material non-public  information regarding the
Company or any Subsidiary of the  Company to such Person or group of Persons
or their  Representatives in response to, such inquiry or Alternative 
Acquisition Proposal, the Company gives Parent written notice of  the
Companys intention to engage in discussions or  negotiations with, or
furnish material non-public information  to, such Person or group of Persons
or their Representatives,  (2) prior to providing any material non-public
information  regarding the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to such 
Person or group of Persons or their Representatives in response  to such
inquiry or Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the Company  enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such  Person or group of Persons or
a Representative thereof (unless  an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement is
already in effect  with such Person or group of Persons or with any Affiliate
or  Representative of such Person or group of Persons), and  (3) prior to
providing any material non-public information  regarding the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company to such  Person or group of Persons or any
Representative or Affiliate of  such Person or group of Persons in response
to such inquiry or  Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the Company makes
such  material non-public information available to Parent (to the  extent
such material non-public information has not been  previously made available
to Parent or any of Parents  Representatives). 

  



  

  (c) Except to the extent prohibited by any confidentiality  agreement or
similar agreement entered into prior to the date  hereof, the Company shall,
as promptly as practicable (but, in  any event, within 24 hours after any
director, officer or  financial advisor of the Company is notified of the
receipt  thereof), notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company 
or any Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative thereof  receives (i)
any Alternative Acquisition Proposal,  (ii) any request for non-public
information in connection  with any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
any  request for discussions or negotiations relating to any  Alternative
Acquisition Proposal. Except to the extent  prohibited by any confidentiality
agreement or similar agreement  entered into prior to the date hereof, such
notification shall  indicate the identity of the Person making such
Alternative  Acquisition Proposal or, and, in the case of an Alternative 
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such  Alternative
Acquisition Proposal (and any material modifications  thereto) (it being
understood that if any of the foregoing is  prohibited by any confidentiality
agreement or similar agreement  entered into prior to the date hereof, the
parties shall use  reasonable best efforts to seek a manner of disclosure of
such  information that would not reasonably be expected to result in 
potential liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).  Except to
the extent prohibited by any confidentiality agreement  or similar agreement
entered into prior to the date hereof, the  Company shall keep Parent
informed of any material developments  with respect to any such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal  (including any material modifications thereto). For
the  avoidance of doubt, prior to engaging in any discussions or 
negotiations with, or providing any non-public or other  information to, any
Person which has a confidentiality agreement  or similar agreement with the
Company or any Subsidiary or  Representative of the Company entered into
prior to the date  hereof that is not an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, the  Company shall either enter into with such Person a new 
confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable  Confidentiality
Agreement or 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  amend such existing confidentiality agreement or similar  agreement such
that it will constitute an Acceptable  Confidentiality Agreement. 

  



  

  (d) Neither the Companys board of directors nor any  committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withdraw or qualify, change or  modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, or publicly propose to  withdraw or qualify, change or modify, in a
manner adverse to  Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) publicly 
recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or  publicly
propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any Alternative  Acquisition Proposal

a  " _Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve  or publicly recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or  recommend, or cause or permit the Company or
any of the  Subsidiaries of the Company to execute or enter into with any 
Person that makes an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (or with  any
Representative of any such Person), any letter of intent,  memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger  agreement, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement  related to any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal, other than any  Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (an "
_Acquisition  Agreement_ "). 

  



  

  (e) Notwithstanding _Section 4.2(d)_ or anything  else in this Agreement
to the contrary, at any time prior to  obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Companys  board of directors may, if the Companys board of
directors  determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial 
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such  action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its  fiduciary duties
under applicable Legal Requirements,  (1) make a Recommendation Change in
response to (A) a  Superior Proposal that did not result from a material
breach by  the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its 
Representatives of this _Section 4.2_ or (B) an  Intervening Circumstance,
and (2) in response to a Superior  Proposal that did not result from a
material breach by the  Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives  of this _Section 4.2_, cause the Company to terminate  this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(e)_;  __provided_ ,_ __that__ , 

  



  

  (i) with respect to a Recommendation Change due to an  Intervening
Circumstance, no such Recommendation Change may be  made unless (A) the
Company shall have delivered to Parent  a written notice advising Parent that

as a  result of an Intervening Circumstance (a " _Notice of  Recommendation
Change_ ") and specifying the reasons  therefor and describing such
Intervening Circumstance in  reasonable detail, (B) at least three business
days shall  have elapsed following the delivery of such Notice of 
Recommendation Change, (C) during such period of three  business days, the
Company shall have negotiated in good faith  with Parent (if Parent shall
have requested in writing that the  Company so negotiate) in an attempt to
make such adjustments to  the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the  Companys board of directors to determine not to effect a 
Recommendation Change, and (D) the Companys board of  directors shall have
in good faith taken into account any  changes to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the  Guarantee that are reflected in any proposed
definitive  amendments that were countersigned by Parent, Acquisition Sub 
and the Guarantors, as applicable, and delivered by Parent to  the Company
during such period of three business days; and 

  



  

  (ii) with respect to a Recommendation Change in response to  a Superior
Proposal that did not result from a material breach  by the Company of
_Section 4.2_, no such  Recommendation Change may be made, and no termination
of this  Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(e)_ may be made,  unless (1) the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a  written notice advising Parent that
the Companys board of  directors intends to make a Recommendation Change 
and/or  terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(e)_ (a  " _Notice
of Superior Proposal_ ") specifying the  material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and the  identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal,  accompanied by a copy of the then-current form of any 
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement  with respect to
such Superior Proposal that the Company has  received from the Person that
made such Superior Proposal,  together with copies of any commitment letters
or similar  material documents received by the Company with respect to any 
financing for such Superior Proposal ( _ _provided__ ,  __that__ , in the
case of any material documents  relating to debt financing, the fee amounts
and certain  "market flex" terms may be redacted); (2) at  least three
business days shall have elapsed following the  delivery of such Notice of
Superior Proposal (it being agreed  that any amendment to the financial or
other material terms of  such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Superior  Proposal, except that the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  applicable time period for purposes of this _Section  4.2(e)(ii)_ with
respect to a new Notice of Superior Proposal  shall be reduced to 48 hours
from the three business days  otherwise contemplated); (3) during such period
of three  business days (or, if applicable, such  48-hour  period)
following the delivery of such Notice of Superior  Proposal, the Company
shall have negotiated in good faith with  Parent (if Parent shall have
requested in writing that the  Company so negotiate) in an attempt to make
such adjustments to  the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Guarantee as  would enable the Companys board of directors to determine 
not to make a Recommendation Change  and/or  terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 6.1(e);_ and  (4) the Companys board of directors shall
have in  good faith taken into account any changes to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement and the Guarantee that are  reflected in any
proposed definitive amendments thereto that  were countersigned by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the  Guarantors, as applicable, and were delivered by
Parent to the  Company during such period of three business days (or, if 
applicable, such  48-hour  period). 

  



  

  (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.2_ or  elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its  board of directors from (i)
making any disclosure to  holders of Company Shares or (ii) taking and
disclosing to  its stockholders a position with respect to a tender or
exchange  offer contemplated by  Rule 14d-9  or  Rule 14e-2(a) 
promulgated under the Exchange Act, in the case of each of  clauses "(i)" and
"(ii)," if the  Companys board of directors determines in good faith 
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the  failure to make
such disclosure would reasonably be expected to  be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Legal  Requirements (it being understood,
however, that this  _Section 4.2(f)_ shall not be deemed to permit the 
Companys board of directors to make a Recommendation  Change or take any
other actions contemplated by  _Section 4.2(e)_ except, in each case, to the
extent  permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions of,  _Section
4.2(e)_) (for the avoidance of doubt, it  being agreed that the issuance by
the Company or its board of  directors of a "stop, look and listen"
statement  pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by  Rules
14d-9  and 14e-2(a)  promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not
constitute a  Recommendation Change)), or (iii) furnishing a copy or 
excerpts of this Agreement to any Person (or to any  Representative of a
Person) that makes any Alternative  Acquisition Proposal or that makes any
inquiry that would  reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative
Acquisition  Proposal. If (i) any public announcement regarding an 
Alternative Acquisition Proposal is made by the Company, any of  its
Subsidiaries or Representatives or the Person making such  Alternative
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) within three  business days following such public
announcement, Parent  delivers to the Company in writing a request that the 
Companys board of directors expressly publicly reaffirm  the Company Board
Recommendation (it being agreed that Parent  may make only two such requests
in the aggregate during the term  of this Agreement), (iii) the Companys
board of  directors does not expressly publicly reaffirm the Company Board 
Recommendation during the period of ten business days following  the delivery
to the Company of such request and (iv) the  Companys board of directors
does not make a Recommendation  Change during such period of ten business
days, then, solely for  purposes of _Section 6.1(d)_, the Company shall be 
deemed to have made a Recommendation Change on the last day of  such period
of ten business days. 

  



  

  4.3 _Meeting of the Company s Stockholders._ 

  



  

  (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this  Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with  the SEC in preliminary form
a proxy statement relating to the  Company Stockholder Meeting (together with
any amendments  thereof or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy  Statement_ ").
Parent shall provide to the Company all  information concerning Parent and
its Affiliates that may be  reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with the Proxy  Statement (including all information required pursuant to
the  Exchange Act, Delaware law and other applicable Legal  Requirements)
and the Company and Parent shall reasonably  cooperate with each other in
connection with the preparation of  the Proxy Statement and the resolution of
any comments received  from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
thereto. The  Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any 
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to  the Proxy
Statement or any request from the SEC or the staff of  the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement,  and shall provide Parent with copies
of all written  correspondence between the Company or any of its 
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of  the SEC, on
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.  The Company and Parent
shall each use its reasonable best  efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of  the SEC or the staff of the SEC with 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  respect to the Proxy Statement and to make any amendments or  filings that
may be necessary in connection therewith. The  Company shall cause the
mailing of the definitive Proxy  Statement to the Persons who are
stockholders of the Company as  of the record date established for the
Company Stockholder  Meeting to commence as promptly as reasonably
practicable after  the date the SEC staff advises the Company that it has
no  further comments thereon or that the Company may commence  mailing the
Proxy Statement (such date, the " _Proxy  Clearance Date_ "), but in no event
later than eight  business days after the Proxy Clearance Date. The Company
shall  provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and  comment
on (i) the draft of the Proxy Statement (including  each amendment or
supplement thereto), and (ii) all written  responses to requests for
additional information by and written  replies to comments of the SEC, prior
to filing the draft of the  Proxy Statement with or sending written responses
to the SEC and  the Company shall consider such comments in good faith. If,
at  any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any  information with
respect to any party hereto should be  discovered by such party which should
be set forth in an  amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that
the Proxy  Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact 
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein  or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the  circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, such  party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the  other parties hereto and, to the
extent required by applicable  Legal Requirements, an appropriate amendment
or supplement  describing such information shall be promptly filed by the 
Company with the SEC. 

  



  

  (b) The Companys board of directors shall, as  promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Proxy Clearance  Date, but in no event later than
five business days after the  Proxy Clearance Date, establish a record date
for, duly call and  give notice of, and, as promptly as reasonably
practicable  following the Proxy Clearance Date, take all reasonable action 
necessary to convene and hold, a meeting of holders of Company  Shares to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval for the  adoption of this Agreement
(in each case, in accordance with  applicable Legal Requirements and the
requirements of the  Companys Organizational Documents) (the " _Company 
Stockholder Meeting_ "), and, unless the Companys  board of directors shall
have effected a Recommendation Change  in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_,
(i) the  Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies 
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and (ii) the  Company shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the  Proxy Statement. 

  



  

  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  this Agreement,
the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company  Stockholder Meeting to the
extent necessary (i) to enable  the Company to comply with its Organizational
Documents and  applicable Legal Requirements, (ii) to enable the  Companys
board of directors to comply with its fiduciary  duties under applicable
Legal Requirements with respect to  disclosure to Company Stockholders of
material information, and  (iii) to ensure that the Company Stockholders are
provided  with any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement 
sufficiently in advance of the vote to be held at the Company  Stockholder
Meeting. In addition, if, on the date for which the  Company Stockholder
Meeting is scheduled (taking into account  any adjournment or postponement of

sufficient number of Company Shares to obtain the  Company Stockholder
Approval for the adoption of this Agreement  (whether or not a quorum is
present) or to constitute a quorum  necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholder  Meeting, then (x) the Company may elect to postpone or 
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting and (y) at  Parents written request
the Company shall adjourn the  Company Stockholder Meeting; __provided_ , 
_however__ , that with respect to this sentence,  (A) the Company may elect
any such postponement or  adjournment, and Parent may elect such adjournment,

transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, to repeal such Legal
Requirement and contest and  resist any Order or Legal Proceeding, including
defending  through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court 
by any Person; and (D) have vacated, lifted, reversed or  overturned any
Legal Requirement, whether temporary, preliminary  or permanent, that

normal business hours, to the Companys and the  Companys Subsidiaries
management team, offices and  other facilities, properties, books, contracts
and records and  (b) the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent such 
reasonably available information concerning its business,  personnel and
properties as Parent or Parents  Representatives may reasonably request;
__provided_ ,  _however__ , that the Company shall not be required  pursuant
to this Agreement to permit any inspection or other  access, or to disclose
any information, that in the reasonable  judgment of the Company would (i)
result in the disclosure  of any trade secrets, (ii) violate any contract or
other  obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company with 
respect to confidentiality or privacy, (iii) jeopardize  protections afforded
the Company or any Subsidiary of the  Company under the attorney-client
privilege or the attorney work  product doctrine, (iv) violate or breach, or

that would not  reasonably be expected to result in potential liability to
the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries). All information obtained by 
Parent and its Representatives pursuant to this  _Section 4.5_ shall be
subject to the terms of the  Confidentiality Agreement. 

  



  

  4.6 _Financing Covenants._  

  



  

  (a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent  shall cause
Acquisition Sub to, use its reasonable best efforts  to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause  to be done, all things necessary to
arrange and obtain the  proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions
set forth  in the Commitment Letters (or on terms more favorable in the 
aggregate to Parent and Acquisition Sub), including the  execution and
delivery of all such instruments and documents as  may be reasonably required
thereunder. Without limiting the  generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Acquisition Sub  shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to: 

  



  

  (i) use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in full  force and effect
the Commitment Letters (or to the extent  superseded thereby, the Definitive
Financing Agreements) in  accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions set  forth therein; 

  



  

  (ii) as promptly as practicable after the date of this  Agreement, use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate, execute  and deliver the Definitive
Financing Agreements on the terms and  conditions (including "market flex"
terms and  conditions) contained in the Commitment Letters or on other 
terms more favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Acquisition  Sub;
__provided__ , __however__ , that in no  event shall any of the Definitive
Financing Agreements:  (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
provided  for in the Commitment Letters (including by changing the amount 
of fees or original issue discount contemplated by the  Commitment Letters)
to an amount that is less than the aggregate  amount of Financing sufficient
to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and make the
payments referred to  in _Section 3.6(e)_; (B) expand the conditions or 
other contingencies to the receipt or funding of the Financing  beyond those
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters,  amend or modify any of such
conditions or other contingencies in  a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub (including by  making any such conditions or other
contingencies less likely to  be satisfied) or impose any new or additional
condition or other  contingency to the receipt or funding of the Financing;
or  (C) contain terms (other than those terms expressly set  forth in the
Commitment Letters) that would reasonably be  expected to (1) prevent or
delay the Effective Time or the  date on which the Financing would be
obtained, or (2) make  the funding of Financing less likely, in any material
respect,  to occur; 

  



  

  (iii) without limiting the effect of  _Section 4.6(b)_, use its reasonable
best efforts to  (A) comply on a timely basis with all of its covenants and 
other obligations set forth in the Commitment Letters, the Debt  Financing
Fee Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements  and (B) satisfy all
conditions and other contingencies set  forth in the Commitment Letters, the
Debt Financing Fee Letters  and the Definitive Financing Agreements; 

   
 ##### 

  

   



  

  (iv) pay in a timely manner any commitment or other fees  that are or
become due and payable under or with respect to any  of the Commitment
Letters, Debt Financing Fee Letters or  Definitive Financing Agreements on or
following the date of this  Agreement; 

  



  

  (v) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all rating  agency approvals
necessary to obtain the Financing; 

  



  

  (vi) if necessary, comply with any "market flex"  provisions contained in
any of the Commitment Letters, the Debt  Financing Fee Letters or the
Definitive Financing Agreements in  the event such "market flex" provisions
are exercised  in accordance with the terms, but subject to the conditions, 
thereof; 

  



  

  (vii) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and  Definitive
Financing Agreements; __provided__ ,  __however__ , that in no event shall
Parent or  Acquisition Sub be required under this  _Section 4.6(a)(vii)_ to
bring any enforcement action  against any source of Equity Financing to
enforce its rights  under the Equity Financing Commitment Letter (or if
superseded  thereby, any Definitive Financing Agreement related thereto); 
__provided__ , __further__ , that nothing in  this Agreement (other than
_Section 7.13(b)_) shall  limit or otherwise affect the Companys ability to
enforce  any of its rights (by litigation or otherwise) as a third party 
beneficiary under the Equity Financing Commitment  Letter; and 

  



  

  (viii) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to cause  the Financing
to be funded in full on or prior to the Required  Closing Date. 

  



  

  (b) Without limiting any of its obligations hereunder,  Parent shall keep
the Company informed on a reasonably current  basis and in reasonable detail
with respect to the status of the  Financing. Parent shall deliver to the
Company accurate and  complete copies of the executed Definitive Financing
Agreements  promptly after their execution. Without limiting the generality 
of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company notice as  promptly as
reasonably practicable (in no event later than  48 hours after obtaining
actual knowledge) of (i) any  material breach or default on the part of any
party to any  Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement,  (ii) any
notice from a party to any Commitment Letter or  Definitive Financing
Agreement of such partys intent to  not comply with any of its commitments
or other material  obligations under any Commitment Letter or Definitive
Financing  Agreement, (iii) any actual or purported withdrawal, 
modification, termination, rescission or repudiation of any  Commitment
Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement, or any  provision thereof, and (iv)
any other circumstance  resulting in Parent no longer believing in good faith
that it  will be able to obtain, prior to the Required Closing Date, all  or
any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or  from the sources
contemplated by any of the Commitment Letters  or Definitive Financing
Agreements. 

  



  

  (c) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall permit any  amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to, or agree to  permit any waiver of
any provision or remedy under, any  Commitment Letter, Debt Financing Fee
Letter or Definitive  Financing Agreement (including any amendment,
supplement,  modification or waiver that has the effect of changing the 
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) without  the Companys
prior written consent, except that Parent and  Acquisition Sub may amend,
supplement or otherwise modify any  Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Agreement (including  by joining one or more additional lenders or agents as
parties  thereto) if such amendment, supplement or modification:  (i) does
not reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing  to an amount that is less
than the aggregate amount of Financing  sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement and make the payments referred
to in  _Section 3.6(e)_ (it being understood that, subject to  the
requirements of this clause "(c)," such amendment,  supplement or other
modification to any Commitment Letter or  Definitive Financing Agreement may
provide for the assignment of  any portion of the commitments under the
Commitment Letters to  additional agents or arrangements and grant such
Persons  approval rights with respect to certain matters as are  customarily
granted to additional agents or arrangers);  (ii) does not expand the
conditions or other contingencies  to the receipt or funding of the
Financing, does not amend or  modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub any of  the conditions or other contingencies to the receipt
or funding  of the Financing (including by making any of such conditions or 
other contingencies less likely to be satisfied) and does not  impose new or
additional conditions or other contingencies to  the receipt or funding of
the Financing; and (iii) would  not reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or
delay the  Effective Time or the date on which the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Financing would be obtained or (B) make the funding of the  Financing less
likely, in any material respect, to occur.  Neither Parent nor Acquisition
Sub shall agree to the  withdrawal, repudiation, termination or rescission of
any  Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement or any  provision
thereof. 

  



  

  (d) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on  the terms and
conditions contemplated in any of the Commitment  Letters or Definitive
Financing Agreements for any reason, or  any of the Commitment Letters or
Definitive Financing Agreements  shall be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated
or rescinded for any  reason, then (without limiting any of their other
obligations  under _Section 4.6(a)(vii)_ or otherwise) Parent and 
Acquisition Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to  arrange and
obtain, as promptly as practicable (but no later  than one business day prior
to the Required Closing Date), from  the same  and/or  alternative
financing sources, alternative financing in an  amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement and make the
payments referred to in  _Section 3.6(e)_; __provided__   __that__ (i) in no
event shall Parent or  Acquisition Sub be obligated to obtain alternative
financing on  terms and conditions that in the aggregate are less favorable
to  Parent or Acquisition Sub (in Parents reasonable judgment)  or, with
respect to alternative equity financing, the Guarantors  (in the Guarantors
reasonable judgment), than those set  forth in the Commitment Letters as of
the date of this  Agreement, and (ii) such alternate financing shall not be 
subject to any new or additional conditions or other  contingencies to the
receipt or funding of the alternate  financing, as compared to the conditions
or other contingencies  to the receipt or funding of the Financing under the
Commitment  Letters as in existence as of the date of this Agreement. In
the  event any alternative financing is obtained in accordance with  this
_Section 4.6(d)_ (" _Alternative  Financing_ "), references in this Agreement
to the  Financing shall be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing 
(in lieu of the Financing replaced thereby), and if one or more  commitment
letters or definitive financing agreements are  entered into or proposed to
be entered into in connection with  such Alternative Financing, references in
this Agreement to the  Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing
Agreements shall  be deemed to refer to such commitment letters and
definitive  financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing (in 
lieu of the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing  Agreements
replaced thereby), and all obligations of Parent and  Acquisition Sub
pursuant to this _Section 4.6_ shall  be applicable thereto to the same
extent as Parents and  Acquisition Subs obligations with respect to the
Financing  replaced thereby. 

  



  

  (e) On and after the date of this Agreement,  (x) clause "(ii)" of Section
4(e) of the  Confidentiality Agreement shall hereby be terminated and of no 
further force and effect and (y) if any portion of the  Financing is not
reasonably likely to become available on the  terms and conditions
contemplated in any of the Commitment  Letters or Definitive Financing
Agreements, then the provisions  of the Confidentiality Agreement restricting
Parent, Acquisition  Sub, the Guarantor and their respective Affiliates and 
Representatives (as defined therein) from (i) discussing  the Merger, the
other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement and all matters related
thereto, and (ii) sharing  Confidential Information (as defined therein), in
each case,  with any potential equity or debt financing source and its 
respective representatives, shall be deemed automatically  waived;
__provided__ , __however__ , that each  such potential equity or debt
financing source and its  representatives will be deemed to be Parents 
"Representatives" (as such term is defined in the  Confidentiality Agreement)
for purposes of the Confidentiality  Agreement. 

  



  

  4.7 _Cooperation by the  Company._ During the period on or prior to the 
Effective Time, upon the reasonable request of Parent, the  Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at  Parents sole expense, use its
reasonable best efforts to  cooperate with Parent in connection with the
Financing,  including using reasonable best efforts to: (A) assist in  the
preparation for and participate in a customary and  reasonable number of
meetings, due diligence sessions,  presentations, drafting sessions, sessions
with rating agencies  and road shows, including to make available, at
reasonable times  and locations, Representatives of the Company and members
of the  Companys finance department, including to assist Parent in 
Parents preparation of any required financial information  (including pro
forma financial information) relating to the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or projections;  (B) provide reasonable assistance with the
preparation of  customary bank information memoranda, rating agency 
presentations, bank syndication materials and high-yield  offering memoranda
required in connection with the Debt  Financing, and provide customary
authorization letters  authorizing the distribution of information relating
to the  Company and any of its Subsidiaries to prospective lenders;  (C)
assist in Parents preparation of and execute and  deliver at the Closing
definitive documents 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  related to the Debt Financing on the terms contemplated by the  Debt
Financing Commitment Letter; (D) obtain (1) no  later than the first day of
the Marketing Period, drafts of  customary and reasonable accountants
comfort letters with  respect to information relating to the Company which
such  auditors are prepared to issue upon completion of customary 
procedures, and (2) corporate and facilities ratings and  necessary consents,
approvals and authorizations in connection  with the Debt Financing as
reasonably requested by Parent;  (E) furnish Parent and the Financing Sources
with the  Required Financial Information; (F) take all actions  reasonably
necessary to (x) permit the Financings Sources  to perform due diligence and
evaluate the Companys current  assets, cash management systems and
accounting systems, and  policies and procedures relating thereto, for the
purpose of  preparing bank memoranda and offering documents and
establishing  collateral arrangements to the extent customary and
reasonable  and (y) assist the Financing Sources in establishing 
relationships with the Companys existing lenders; and  (G) deliver notices
of prepayment (contingent upon the  Closing and otherwise in form and
substance acceptable to the  Company) and obtain customary payoff letters,
lien terminations  and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the
Closing, and  give any other necessary notices (contingent upon the Closing 
and otherwise in form and substance acceptable to the Company),  to allow for
the payoff, discharge and termination in full, at  the Closing, of all of the
Companys indebtedness other  than as set forth in Part 4.7 of the Disclosure
Schedule  (the " _Debt Payoff_ "). Notwithstanding the  foregoing: (a)
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall ensure that  such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with  the ongoing business or operations of the
Company or any  Subsidiary of the Company; (b) neither the Company nor any 
Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to commit to take  any action
that (i) is not contingent upon the Closing,  (ii) would be effective prior
to the Effective Time, or  (iii) would encumber any assets of the Company or
any of  its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; (c) neither  the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall be required  to (i) take any
action that would result in a breach of any  contract or subject it to actual
or potential liability,  (ii) bear any cost or expense, or (iii) pay any 
commitment or other fee or make any other payment or incur any  other
liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity  prior to the
Effective Time; and (d) neither the Company  nor any Subsidiary of the
Company, nor any of their respective  directors or officers, shall (i) be
required to take any  action in the capacity as a member of the board of
directors of  the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to authorize or 
approve the Financing (or any Alternative Financing),  (ii) have any
liability or any obligation under any  Definitive Financing Agreement or any
related document or other  agreement or document related to the Financing (or
Alternative  Financing), other than any such liability or obligation of the 
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries following the Merger,  or (iii) be
required to incur any other liability in  connection with the Financing (or
any Alternative Financing),  other than any other liability incurred by the
Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries following the Merger. Parent 
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the  Company for all
reasonable and documented costs, including all  reasonable and documented 
out-of-pocket  fees and expenses of counsel and other advisors, incurred by
the  Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in connection with such 
cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the  Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective  Affiliates and
Representatives (collectively, the  " _Section 4.7 Indemnitees_") against any
and  all costs and expenses (including advancing attorneys fees  and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,  suit, proceeding
or investigation), judgments, fines, claims,  losses, penalties, damages,
interest, awards and liabilities  directly or indirectly suffered or incurred
by the  Section 4.7 Indemnitees in connection with the Financing,  including
any information provided in connection therewith or  the Companys
cooperation with respect thereto. This  _Section 4.7_ shall survive the
consummation of the  Merger and the Effective Time and any termination of
this  Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by,  the
Section 4.7 Indemnitees and their respective heirs,  executors, estates,
personal representatives, successors and  assigns, and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of  Parent. In the event of any merger,
consolidation or other  similar transaction involving Parent or in the event
of any sale  or other disposition by Parent of all or substantially all of 
its assets, Parent shall ensure that an Entity no less  financially viable
than Parent remains responsible for the  obligations of Parent under this
_Section 4.7_. 

  



  

  4.8 _Reserved._  

  



  

  4.9 _Interim Operations of Acquisition  Sub._ Prior to the Effective Time,
Acquisition Sub  shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as 
provided in or contemplated by this Agreement or the Commitment  Letters. 

   
 ##### 

  

   



  

  4.10 _Publicity._ The initial press  release relating to this Agreement
shall be a joint press  release issued by the Company and Parent, and
thereafter the  Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to 
issuing any press releases or otherwise making public  statements, in each
case with respect to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement;
__provided_ ,  _however__ , that nothing in this  _Section 4.10_ shall limit
the rights of the Company  or the Companys board of directors under 
_Section 4.2(d)_ or _Section 4.2(e)_. 

  



  

  4.11 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock; Restricted  Stock Units._ The
Company (and, after the  Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall
take all action  necessary to ensure that each Company Share that
constitutes  unvested restricted stock of the Company immediately prior to 
the Effective Time (after giving effect to any accelerated  vesting pursuant
to _Section 1.9_) (each an  " _Unvested Company Share_ ") shall be
converted  immediately after the Effective Time into the right to receive 
an unfunded, unsecured cash amount equal to the Per Share Amount  for each
such Unvested Company Share, subject to the same  forfeiture provisions
applicable to such Unvested Company Share  immediately prior to the Effective
Time, with the applicable  cash amount payable to the holder of such Unvested
Company Share  within two business days following the date on which the 
applicable forfeiture provisions lapse, except that any  condition related to
continued employment shall be deemed to  refer to employment with the
Surviving Corporation or its  Affiliates. 

  



  

  4.12 _Other Employee Benefits._  

  



  

  (a) Parent agrees that employees of the Company or any  Subsidiary of the
Company who continue employment with Parent,  the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary of the Surviving  Corporation after the Effective Time (each,
a  " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall, for one year  following the Effective
Time, (i) be entitled to receive  base pay (in each case, excluding equity-
related compensation  (including phantom equity) and any transaction
bonuses,  retention bonuses and similar arrangements of the Company or any 
Company Subsidiary) that are no less favorable in the aggregate  to such
Continuing Employees, respectively, as the base pay in  place with respect to
such Continuing Employees as of the date  of this Agreement, and (ii) welfare
and other employee  benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension plan
benefits)  that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to such 
Continuing Employee as those provided as of the date of this  Agreement by
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. 

  



  

  (b) As of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee  shall receive full
credit (for all purposes, including  eligibility to participate, vesting,
benefit accrual, vacation  entitlement and severance benefits) for service
with the Company  or its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent
the  Company provides such past service credit) under the comparable 
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of the Surviving  Corporation
in which such Continuing Employee becomes a  participant; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that  nothing herein shall result in the duplication of any
benefits  for the same period of service. As of the Effective Time, the 
Surviving Corporation shall credit to each Continuing Employee  the amount of
vacation time that such Continuing Employee had  accrued under any applicable
Company Plan as of the Effective  Time. With respect to each health or
welfare benefit plan  maintained by the Surviving Corporation for the benefit
of  Continuing Employees, Parent shall use its commercially  reasonable
efforts to ensure that its third party insurance  carriers (i) cause to be
waived any eligibility waiting  periods, any evidence of insurability
requirements and the  application of any pre-existing condition limitations
under such  plan, and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given 
credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing  Employee
under any similar Company Plan for the plan year that  includes the Effective
Time for purposes of applying  deductibles, co-payments and  out-of-pocket 
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with  the terms
and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent, the  Surviving Corporation
or any Affiliate of Parent, as applicable,  for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs. 

  



  

  (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor  in accordance
with their terms all deferred compensation plans,  agreements and
arrangements, severance and separation pay plans,  agreements and
arrangements and all written employment,  retention, incentive, change in
control and termination  agreements (including any change in control
provisions therein)  applicable to employees of the Company and the Company 
Subsidiaries. 

   
 ##### 

  

   



  

  (d) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third  party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee of  the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (including any beneficiary  or dependent thereof) in
respect of continued employment by the  Company or any Company Subsidiary or
otherwise. Nothing herein  shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of
time or  preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to 
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time  and for any
reason, (ii) require Parent or the Surviving  Corporation to continue any
Company Plans, or other employee  benefit plans or arrangements or prevent
the amendment,  modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time,
or  (iii) amend any Company Plans or other employee benefit  plans or
arrangements. 

  



  

  (e) The provisions of this _Section 4.12_ are  solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and no  Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent  thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party  beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this 
_Section 4.12_ shall create such rights in any such  persons. 

  



  

  4.13 _Indemnification; Directors  and  Officers Insurance._ 

  



  

  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and  shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,  fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company  and each Subsidiary of the Company
pursuant to (i) each  indemnification, advancement of expenses or similar
agreement in  effect between the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
and  any Indemnified Party as of the date of this Agreement and  (ii) any
indemnification, exculpation from liability or  advancement of expenses
provision set forth in the  Organizational Documents of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the  Company as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
From and  after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving 
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain in effect the  indemnification,
exculpation from liability and advancement of  expenses provisions set forth
in the Organizational Documents of  the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company as in effect as  of the date of this Agreement, and shall not permit
the  amendment (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise),  repeal or
other modification of any such provisions in any  manner that would adversely
affect any of the rights thereunder  of any Indemnified Party. 

  



  

  (b) Without limiting the rights of the Indemnified Parties  under _Section
4.13(a)_ or  _Section 4.13(c)_, from and after the Effective Time,  Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally  indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party against and  from any costs, fees and
expenses (including attorneys  fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses,  claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
in  connection with any claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration,  investigation
or inquiry, whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative, to the
extent such claim, Legal  Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry
arises  directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, out of or pertains 
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to: (i) any  action or omission
or alleged action or omission in such  Indemnified Partys capacity as a
director, officer,  employee, fiduciary or agent of (A) the Company or any 
Subsidiary or other Affiliate of the Company, or (B) any  employee benefit
plan or other Entity or enterprise with respect  to which such Indemnified
Party has at any time served as a  director, officer, employee, fiduciary or
agent at the request  of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
(regardless of  whether such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission,  occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); or  (ii) any
action or transaction contemplated by this  Agreement or taken at the request
of Parent, the Company or any  Subsidiary of the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the  contrary contained in this _Section 4.13(b)_ or  elsewhere
in this Agreement, Parent agrees that it shall not  settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or  otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, Legal  Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or
inquiry for which  indemnification may be sought under this Agreement unless
such  settlement, compromise, consent or termination (i) includes  an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties from all  liability arising
out of such claim, Legal Proceeding,  arbitration, investigation or inquiry
and (ii) imposes no  obligation of any nature on any Indemnified Party. In
addition,  from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause 
the Surviving Corporation to, advance, prior to the final  disposition of any
claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration,  investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought  under this Agreement, promptly following any
written request by  an Indemnified Party therefor, all reasonable  out-of-
pocket  costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented 
attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred or  expected to be 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with any such  claim,
Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry. 

  



  

  (c) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary  of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in  effect, for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties, the current  level and scope of
directors and officers liability  insurance coverage as set forth in the
Companys  directors and officers liability insurance policies  in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the  " _Existing Policies_ ");
__provided_ ,  _however__ , that (i) in no event shall Parent be  required
pursuant to this _Section 4.13(c)_ to expend  in any one year an amount in
excess of 300% of the annual  premiums payable by the Company with respect to
the Existing  Policies for 2011, it being understood that if the annual 
premiums payable in one year for such insurance coverage exceed  300% of the
annual premiums payable by the Company with respect  to the Existing Policies
in 2011, then Parent shall be obligated  to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for an  annual premium equal to 300% of the annual
premiums payable by  the Company with respect to the Existing Policies in
2011, and  (ii) in lieu of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything  to
the contrary contained in clause "(i)" above, the  Company may obtain prior
to the Effective Time a prepaid  "tail" policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") 
providing the Indemnified Parties with directors and  officers liability
insurance for a period ending no  earlier than the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time so long  as the aggregate amount paid by the Company for the
Tail Policy  does not exceed 300% of the annual premiums payable by the 
Company with respect to the Existing Policies for coverage in  2011. Parent
shall cause any such Tail Policy to be maintained  in full force and effect
for its full term, and cause all  obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving  Corporation. In the event that any of the carriers issuing or 
reinsuring the Tail Policy shall become insolvent or otherwise  financially
distressed such that any of them is reasonably  likely to be unable to
satisfy its financial obligations under  the Tail Policy at any time during
the term thereof, Parent  agrees that it shall, from time to time, cause the
Tail Policy  to be replaced with another prepaid "tail" policy on  terms and
conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits  and coverage levels
as the Tail Policy, with a term extending  for the remainder of such term
(the " _New Tail  Policy_ "). In such event, references in this Agreement 
to the Tail Policy shall be deemed to include any New Tail  Policy, as
applicable. 

  



  

  (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this  _Section 4.13_ shall
be in addition to, and not in  limitation of, any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have  under the Organizational Documents of the Company
or any  Subsidiary of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, under  any
other indemnification or similar arrangement, under the DGCL  or otherwise.
This _Section 4.13_ shall survive the  Effective Time, and is intended to
benefit, and may be enforced  by, the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs,  executors, estates, personal representatives, successors
and  assigns, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of  Parent
and the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any  merger, consolidation or
other similar transaction involving  Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or
in the event of any sale  or other disposition by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation of  all or substantially all of its assets, Parent shall ensure
that  the acquirer thereof shall assume the obligations of Parent and  the
Surviving Corporation under this _Section 4.13_. 

  



  

  (e) For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is  or was an
officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary  of the Company at any
time prior to the Effective Time shall be  deemed to be an " _Indemnified
Party_." 

  



  

  4.14 _Rule 16b-3  Actions._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, 
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all commercially  reasonable
actions as may be required to cause any dispositions  of equity securities of
the Company resulting from the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual  who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt
under  Rule 16b-3  promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  



  

  4.15 _Parent Vote._ Immediately  following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall execute  and deliver, in accordance with Section 228
of the DGCL and  in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub,
a  written consent adopting the Agreement. 

  



  

  4.16 _Redemption of Convertible  Debt._ If requested by Parent within 15
days  following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall  redeem
the Convertible Debt in accordance with its terms, which  redemption shall
occur no later than 30 days prior to the  Closing Date, and the Company will
allow for the conversion of  the Convertible Debt in accordance with its
terms. 

   
 ##### 

  

   



  

  4.17 _Stockholder Litigation._ The  Company shall provide Parent with the
opportunity to participate  in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation  against the Company or the Companys board of directors 
relating to the Merger (it being understood that the Company  shall control
the defense and settlement of any such litigation  with counsel of its own
choosing), and no such settlement shall  be agreed to and entered unless
Parent shall have otherwise  consented in writing prior to such agreement and
the entry of  such settlement (which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  



  

  Section 5 _CONDITIONS  TO THE PARTIES  OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER_ 

  



  

  5.1 _Conditions to Obligation of Each  Party._ The obligation of each
party to effect the  Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the  following conditions: 

  



  

  (a) The Company Stockholder Approval shall have been  obtained. 

  



  

  (b) No injunction shall have been issued by a court of  competent
jurisdiction and shall be continuing that prohibits  the consummation of the
Merger, and no court of competent  jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
shall have enacted a  Legal Requirement since the date of this Agreement that
shall  remain in effect and prohibits the consummation of the Merger. 

  



  

  (c) The waiting period applicable to the consummation of  the Merger under
the HSR Act shall have expired or been  terminated. 

  



  

  5.2 _Conditions to Obligations of Parent and  Acquisition Sub._ The
obligations of Parent and  Acquisition Sub to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the  satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions: 

  



  

  (a) (i) Each of the representations and warranties of  the Company
contained in this Agreement, other than the  Fundamental Representations,
shall be accurate in all respects  as of the date hereof and as of the
Required Closing Date as if  made on and as of the Required Closing Date
(other than any such  representation and warranty made as of a specific
earlier date,  which need be accurate in all respects only as of such
earlier  date), except where the failure of such representations and 
warranties to be accurate (considered collectively) does not  constitute, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, a  Material Adverse Effect;
__provided,__   __however,__ that, for purposes of determining the  accuracy
of such representations and warranties, all Material  Adverse Effect and
materiality qualifications contained therein  shall be disregarded (it being
understood, however, that the  reference to "Material Adverse Effect" in 
_Section 2.5(b)(i)_ shall not be disregarded); and  (ii) each of the
representations and warranties contained  in _Section 2.1(a)_, the second
sentence of  _Section 2.2_, the first, second and fifth sentences  of
_Section 2.3(a)_, _Section 2.3(b)_,  _Section 2.18_, _Section 2.19_ and 
_Section 2.20(a)(i)_ (the " _Fundamental  Representations_ ") shall be
accurate in all material  respects as of the date hereof and as of the
Required Closing  Date as if made on and as of the Required Closing Date
(other  than any Fundamental Representation made as of a specific  earlier
date, which need be accurate in all material respects  only as of such
earlier date). Solely for purposes of this  _Section 5.2(a)_, if one or more
inaccuracies in the  representations set forth in the first, second and
fifth  sentences of _Section 2.3(a)_ or in  _Section 2.3(b)_ would result in
an increase in the  amounts payable pursuant to _Section 1.7_,  _Section
1.9_ or _Section 4.11_ of more than  $5,000,000 in the aggregate, such
inaccuracies will be deemed  material for purposes of this _Section
5.2(a)_. 

  



  

  (b) All of the covenants in this Agreement that the Company  is required
to comply with or to perform at or prior to the  Closing shall have been
complied with and performed in all  material respects. 

  



  

  (c) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall have received a  certificate signed
on behalf of the Company by an executive  officer to the effect that the
conditions set forth in  _Section 5.2(a)_, _Section 5.2(b)_ and  _Section
5.2(d)_ have been satisfied. 

  



  

  (d) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there shall not have  occurred any
Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  5.3 _Conditions to Obligation of the  Company._ The obligation of the
Company to effect  the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the  following conditions: 

  



  

  (a) Each of the representations and warranties of Parent  and Acquisition
Sub contained in this Agreement shall be  accurate in all respects as of the
Required Closing Date as if  made on and as of the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Required Closing Date (other than any such representation and  warranty
made as of a specific earlier date, which need be  accurate in all respects
only as of such earlier date), except  where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be  accurate would not reasonably be
expected to have an adverse  effect on the ability of Parent or Acquisition
Sub to consummate  the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby  (including the Financing) on a timely basis. 

  



  

  (b) All of the covenants in this Agreement that Parent and  Acquisition
Sub are required to comply with or to perform at or  prior to the Closing
shall have been complied with and performed  in all material respects. 

  



  

  (c) The Company shall have received a certificate signed on  behalf of
each of Parent and Acquisition Sub by an executive  officer of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to the effect that the  conditions set forth in _Section
5.3(a)_ and  _Section 5.3(b)_ have been satisfied. 

  



  

  5.4 _Frustration of Closing  Conditions._ None of the Company, Parent
and  Acquisition Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set  forth in
_Section 5.1_, _Section 5.2_ or  _Section 5.3_, as the case may be, to be
satisfied if  such failure was caused by such partys failure or the 
failure of any Affiliate of such party to use its required  efforts (to the
extent required by this Agreement) to consummate  the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or otherwise to comply with its
obligations hereunder.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if
a condition  set forth in _Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.2_  shall not have
been satisfied and the failure to satisfy such  condition results from the
failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub  to use its required efforts under this
Agreement to consummate  the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement or otherwise comply with its obligations hereunder,  such
condition shall be deemed satisfied for purposes of  _Section 6.1(j)_ and
_Section 6.3(b)_. 

  



  

  Section 6 _TERMINATION_  

  



  

  6.1 _Termination._ This Agreement may  be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned (before or after  the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of

directors, and by Parent, by action of its board of  managers, at any time
prior to the Effective Time; 

  



  

  (b) by Parent or the Company, at any time after  February 10, 2012 (the "
_End Date_ ") and  prior to the Effective Time if the Effective Time shall
not have  occurred on or before the End Date; __provided__ ,  __however__ ,
that a party shall not be permitted to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this  _Section 6.1(b)_ if the failure of such party (for  purposes of
Parent, including the failure of Acquisition Sub) to  perform any covenant or
other obligation required to be  performed by such party (including the
obligation to consummate  the Merger on the Required Closing Date, and, for
purposes of  Parent, including any covenant or obligation required to be 
performed by Acquisition Sub) at or prior to the Effective Time  resulted in
the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred  on or before the End
Date; 

  



  

  (c) by Parent or the Company at any time prior to the  Effective Time if
there shall be any Legal Requirement enacted  after the date of this
Agreement and remaining in effect that  prohibits the consummation of the
Merger, or any court of  competent jurisdiction shall have issued a permanent
injunction  prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such injunction 
shall have become final and non-appealable; __provided_ ,  _however__ , that
a party shall not be permitted to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this  _Section 6.1(c)_ if the issuance of any such  injunction results from
the failure of such party (for purposes  of Parent, including the failure of
Acquisition Sub) to perform  any covenant or other obligation in this
Agreement required to  be performed by such party (for purposes of Parent,
including  any covenant or obligation required to be performed by 
Acquisition Sub) at or prior to the Effective Time;

such Recommendation Change;

Approval if (i) the Companys  board of directors has determined to accept,

Superior  Proposal, (ii) such Superior Proposal did not result from a 
material breach of _Section 4.2_ by the Company, any  Company Subsidiary or
any Representative of the Company,  (iii) the Company shall have complied
with the terms and  conditions of _Section 4.2(e)_ with respect to such 
Superior Proposal, (iv) prior to or substantially  concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement the Company  enters into one or more

  (f) by Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time if  (i) there shall
be an inaccuracy as of such time in any  representation or warranty of the
Company contained in  _Section 2_ (assuming such representation and
warranty  were made as of such time) such that the condition contained in 
_Section 5.2(a)_ would not be satisfied as of such  time, (ii) Parent shall
have delivered to the Company a  written notice of such inaccuracy, and (iii)

condition  contained in _Section 5.3(a)_ would not be satisfied  as of such
time, (ii) the Company shall have delivered to  Parent a written notice of
such inaccuracy, and (iii) such  inaccuracy shall not have been cured in all

such time), or if the Company shall  have breached any covenant or other

satisfied; 

  



  

  (i) by the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time  if (i) any

Agreement shall have been  breached such that the condition contained in 
_Section 5.3(b)_ would not be satisfied, (ii) the  Company shall have

time of  termination, (iii) any Person (other than Parent or its 
Affiliates) shall have made an Alternative Acquisition Proposal  that becomes
publicly known between the date of this Agreement  and the day prior to the
date on which the Company Stockholder  Meeting was convened, and (iv) within
twelve months after  such termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
have  entered into or consummated a transaction contemplated by an 
Alternative Acquisition Proposal made by a Person (other than  Parent and its
Affiliates), then within two business days after  the earlier of the date of
the consummation of such transaction  or entering into the definitive
acquisition agreement providing  for such transaction, as the case may be,
the Company shall  cause to be paid to Parent (or its designee, as designated
by  Parent in writing), in cash by wire transfer of immediately  available
funds, an amount equal to the Termination Fee (less  the amount of Expenses
paid by the Company pursuant to  _Section 6.3(e))_; __provided__ , 
__however__ , that, for purposes of this  _Section 6.3(d)_, all references to

this Agreement, and that  without these agreements the parties would not
enter into this  Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent or the Company fails to
pay  when due any amount payable pursuant to this  _Section 6.3_, then: (i)
such party shall  reimburse the other party for all fees, costs and
expenses  (including legal fees) incurred in connection with any action 
taken to collect payment and in connection with the enforcement  by the other
party of its rights under this  _Section 6.3_; and (ii) such party shall pay
to  the other party interest on the overdue amount (for the period 
commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally  required to be
paid and ending on the date such overdue amount  is actually paid to such
other party in full) at a rate per  annum 300 basis points over the "prime
rate" (as  announced by Bank of America or any successor thereto) in effect 
on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be  paid. 

  



  

  (g) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no  event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee  or Parent be required to pay
the Reverse Termination Fee on more  than one occasion, whether or not the

6.4_ shall be deemed to affect the right  of the Company to obtain specific
performance pursuant to and in  accordance with _Section 7.13_ prior to the 
termination of this Agreement. 

  



  

  (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement  to the
contrary, the provisions of this _Section 6.4_  are expressly intended to

pursuant to  _Section 6.3(f)_), (ii) right to receive  Parents and
Acquisition Subs Expenses pursuant to  _Section 6.3(e)_, and (iii) right to
pursue  damages solely for willful and intentional breaches of  _Section
4.2_ (subject in all respects to the Company  No-Shop Breach Liability
Limitation) shall constitute the sole  and exclusive remedies of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the  Guarantors (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or  otherwise, but without prejudice to the remedy of specific 
performance set forth in _Section 7.13_) against the  Company and its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective  stockholders, former, current and
future directors, officers,  employees, agents, Affiliates and assignees (the
Company, its  Subsidiaries and such other Persons being referred to 
collectively in this Agreement as the " _Company Related  Parties_ ") for any
losses or damages of any kind for, or  with respect to, this Agreement
(including any breach of this  Agreement by the Company), the transactions
contemplated hereby,  the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims
or  actions under applicable Legal Requirements arising out of such  breach,
termination or failure. 

  



  

  (b) Subject to _Section 6.5(c)_, the maximum  aggregate liability of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for  damages in connection with this Agreement
or any of the  transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to the
Company  Liability Limitation, and, subject to _Section 6.5(c)_ , in  no
event shall the Guarantors, Parent or Acquisition Sub be  permitted to
obtain, nor shall they permit any of their  respective Representatives or any
other Person acting on its or  their behalf to obtain, any monetary
recoveries or awards  (A) in excess of the Company Liability Limitation
against  any of the Company Related Parties (in the aggregate) or  (B) for
consequential, special, indirect or punitive  damages for, or with respect
to, this Agreement (including any  breach of this Agreement by the Company),
or the transactions  contemplated hereby, the termination of this Agreement,
the  failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement
or any claims or actions under applicable Legal  Requirements arising out of
such breach, termination or failure;  __provided__ , __however__ , that in no
event  shall Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any Affiliate of Parent or 
Acquisition Sub, be entitled to obtain both: (x) the  Termination Fee (plus
any amounts that may become payable  pursuant to _Section 6.3(f))_ and
Parents and  Acquisition Subs Expenses pursuant to  _Section 6.3(e)_; and
(y) specific performance of  this Agreement resulting in the consummation of
the Merger. 

  



  

  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  _Section 6.5(b)_ shall not limit the
ability of Parent  or Acquisition Sub to pursue damages solely for any
willful and  intentional breach of _Section 4.2_ by the Company,  any
Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company,  provided that in no
event shall Parent or Acquisition Sub be  permitted to obtain any monetary
recoveries or awards  (A) in excess of the Company No-Shop Breach Liability 
Limitation against any of the Company Related Parties (in the  aggregate)
with respect to such willful and intentional breaches  or otherwise or (B)
for consequential, special, indirect or  punitive damages for, or with
respect to, this Agreement  (including any breach of _Section 4.2_ or any
other  provision of this Agreement by the Company), or the transactions 
contemplated hereby, the termination of this Agreement, the  failure to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or any claims or
actions under applicable Legal  Requirements arising out of such breach,
termination or failure.  For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Company be  required to make any monetary payments that in the aggregate 
exceed the Company No-Shop Breach Liability Limitation, and in  the event
Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have received any  amounts from the Company
(whether due to the payment of the  Termination Fee, reimbursement of
Expenses, or otherwise), such  amounts shall reduce the amount of monetary
recoveries or awards  for any willful and intentional breach of  _Section
4.2_, such that in no event shall the Company  be required to pay any
monetary recoveries or awards to Parent  or any Parent Related Parties in
excess of the Company No-Shop  Breach Liability Limitation.

contrary, the provisions of this _Section 6.5_  are expressly intended to
benefit, and are enforceable by, each  of the Company Related Parties.

acknowledge and agree that, prior to  the termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled  to obtain a decree or order of specific
performance to cause  Parent and Acquisition Sub to draw down the full
proceeds of the  Equity Financing and to cause Parent and Acquisition Sub
to  cause the Equity Financing to be funded in order to fund and  consummate
the Merger, and to cause the consummation of the  Merger, if and only if (A)
each of the conditions in  _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ shall have  been
satisfied or waived (other than the condition set forth in  _Section 5.2(c)_,
which must be satisfied at Closing),  (B) the Debt Financing shall have been
funded, or will be  funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded
at the  Closing, (C) Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have failed to 
consummate the Merger on the Required Closing Date (for the  avoidance of
doubt, which for purposes of this  _Section 7.13(b)_ shall not occur prior to
the  expiration of the Marketing Period), and (D) the Company  shall have
confirmed in writing that if both the Equity  Financing and the Debt
Financing were funded, the Closing will  occur (and the Company has not
revoked such confirmation). 

  



  

  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing has not been  funded
(and will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity  Financing is funded at
the Closing), then the Company shall not  be entitled to obtain a decree or
order of specific performance  to cause Parent and Acquisition Sub to draw
down the full  proceeds of the Equity Financing and to cause Parent and 
Acquisition Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in  order to fund
and consummate the Merger, and to cause the  consummation of the Merger. 

  



  

  For the further avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be  entitled to
enforce its rights (by litigation or otherwise) as a  third party beneficiary
under the Equity Financing Commitment  Letter in the event that the
conditions in this clause (b)  are satisfied. 

  



  

  (c) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the  granting of
specific performance or an injunction sought in  accordance with this
_Section 7.13_ on the basis that  any other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award  of specific performance is, for any reason, not an
appropriate  remedy. Any party seeking an injunction, a decree or order of 
specific performance or other equitable remedy in accordance  with this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or  other security in
connection with any such injunction or other  equitable remedy. The election
by the Company to pursue specific  performance or an injunction shall not
restrict, impair or  otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative,
seeking to  terminate this Agreement and obtain the Reverse Termination Fee 
under _Section 6.3_, and the election by Parent to  pursue specific
performance or an injunction shall not restrict,  impair or otherwise limit
Parent from, in the alternative,  seeking to terminate this Agreement and
obtain the Termination  Fee or Parent and Acquisition Subs Expenses, as 
applicable, under _Section 6.3._ If any party obtains  (i) a decree or order
of specific performance requiring  another party (other than an Affiliate of
such party) to enforce  specifically the observance and performance of any
covenant or  obligation set forth in this Agreement, or (ii) any  injunction
restraining a breach or threatened breach by another  party (other than an
Affiliate of such party) of any covenant or  other obligation set forth in
this Agreement, then the other  party (other than an Affiliate of such party)
shall reimburse  such party for all reasonable, documented  out-of-pocket 
expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, 
accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants)  actually incurred
by or on behalf of such party or any  Subsidiary of such party in connection
with the obtaining of  such decree or order of specific performance or
injunction.
