recognized public accounting firm (the "Accounting Referee") to make a final,
non-appealable and binding determination as to such remaining Disputed Items
pursuant to the terms hereof. The Accounting Referee shall be directed to
make a determination of the Disputed Items in accordance with Section 3.5(d)

appointment. Parent and the Securityholders' Representative agree to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to effect the selection and appointment
of the Accounting

 

23

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 24

 



 

Referee pursuant to this Section 3.5(c) within ten (10) Business Days after

Accounting Referee providing for reasonable and customary compensation and

Representative shall make readily available to the Accounting Referee all
relevant books, records and employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (if any) that are reasonably requested by the Accounting Referee

Referee for resolution pursuant to Section 3.5(c), the Accounting Referee
shall determine only with respect to the Disputed Items submitted whether and
to what extent, if any, the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the components
thereof set forth in the Closing Statement require adjustment. With respect
to each Disputed Item, the Accounting Referee's determination shall be within
the range of values assigned to such Disputed Item by Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative. Any finding by the Accounting Referee shall
be (i) a reasoned award stating in reasonable detail the findings of fact on
which it is based, (ii) final, non-appealable and binding upon the parties
hereto and (iii) the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties hereto
regarding the Disputed Items so presented. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne by Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares) in the same proportion that the dollar amount of
Disputed Items which are not resolved in favor of Parent or the
Securityholders' Representative, as applicable, bears to the total dollar
amount of Disputed Items resolved by the Accounting Referee. Each of Parent
and the Securityholders' Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) shall bear the fees, costs
and expenses of its own accountants and all of its other expenses incurred in

set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement exceeds the Final Aggregate
Merger Consideration, Parent shall be entitled to recover the amount of such

in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement; and
(ii) second, to the extent such excess exceeds the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Funds, at Parent's sole option, either (1) from the Indemnification
Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement, (2) from the Securityholders' Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) out of
the Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund, (3) from the Joining
Parties, severally in accordance with their respective Joining Party Pro Rata
Shares, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Parent, (4) by way of set-off pursuant to Section 10.8 or (5)
from any combination of the foregoing. The Securityholders' Representative
and Parent shall execute and deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to such excess from
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and, if applicable, from the

 

24

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 25

 



 

Indemnification Escrow Account, within five (5) Business Days after the

Consideration, the Joining Parties shall make any such payment to Parent as

sentence of this Section 3.5(e) is less than the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Funds, Parent and the Securityholders' Representative shall execute and
deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to release the remaining Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds after giving

3.5(e) to (i) the Paying Agent for distribution to the Securityholders in
respect of such shares of Capital Stock and In the Money Vested Options that
are Non-Withholding Options and (ii) the Surviving Corporation for
distribution to the Optionholders in respect of the In the Money Vested
Options (other than the Non-Withholding Options) in accordance with the
principles of Section 3.1 and Section 3.2. The Paying Agent shall make
distributions pursuant to this Section 3.5(e)(i) to the Securityholders in the
same form and in accordance with the same wiring instructions or delivery
addresses, as applicable, as used to make distributions to each such
Securityholder in connection with Closing (including, if applicable, by
relying on the payment instructions set forth in the applicable Letter of
Transmittal or the Consideration Spreadsheet), except as otherwise indicated
in any written update delivered to the Paying Agent to reflect any assignments
or other changes in factual information.

 

(ii)If the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration is greater than the Aggregate
Merger Consideration set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, the amount
of such excess shall be owed to the Securityholders in respect of their shares
of Capital Stock and In the Money Vested Options. In such case, Parent shall
deliver, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Aggregate Merger Consideration, cash in an aggregate amount equal to such
excess to the Paying Agent and, in the case of the holders of In the Money
Vested Options (other than Non-Withholding Options), the Surviving
Corporation, who shall disburse within five (5) Business Days of its receipt
thereof such amount to the Securityholders in respect of such shares of
Capital Stock and In the Money Vested Options in accordance with the
principles of Section 3.1 and Section 3.2. The Paying Agent shall make
distributions pursuant to this Section 3.5(e)(ii) to the Securityholders in
the same form and in accordance with the same wiring instructions or delivery
addresses, as applicable, as used to make distributions to each such
Securityholder in connection with Closing (including, if applicable, by
relying on the payment instructions set forth in the applicable Letter of
Transmittal or the Consideration Spreadsheet), except as otherwise indicated
in any written update delivered to the Paying Agent to reflect any assignments
or other changes in factual information.

 

(iii)Any payment pursuant to this Section 3.5(e) shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration.

 

(f)Subject to Section 13.13, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that the purchase price adjustment provisions set forth in this Section
3.5 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto, the Parent
Indemnified Parties, the Joining Parties and

 

25

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 26

 



 

any other Person with respect to (i) determining whether or not any adjustment
would be made to the Aggregate Merger Consideration based on Unpaid
Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness, Cash and Cash Equivalents and Net Working
Capital (or any component of any such item) pursuant to this Section 3.5
(whether or not any such adjustment was, in fact, made), and/or (ii)
determining the amount of any such adjustment.

 

3.6Expense Amount. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit into an
account designated by the Securityholders' Representative (the
"Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund") an amount equal to $350,000
(such amount, the "Securityholders' Representative Expense Amount"). The
Securityholders' Representative Expense Amount may be used at any time by the
Securityholders' Representative to fund or reimburse (a) any expenses incurred
by it in the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder (including
its obligations under Section 3.5(e)), under the Escrow Agreement, or under
the Securityholders' Representative engagement agreement including those
duties and obligations listed in Article XII, or (b) as otherwise determined
by the Advisory Group. The Securityholders' Representative is not providing
any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Securityholders'
Representative Expense Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Securityholders' Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the
Securityholders' Representative Expense Amount, and has no tax reporting or
income distribution obligations. The Indemnitors will not receive any
interest on the Securityholders' Representative Expense Amount and assign to
the Securityholders' Representative any such interest. Subject to Advisory
Group approval, the Securityholders' Representative may contribute funds to
the Securityholders' Representative Expense Amount from any consideration
otherwise distributable to the Indemnitors from the Escrow Funds. The
Securityholders' Representative Expense Amount will be held by the
Securityholders' Representative for so long as the Securityholders'
Representative determines is reasonably necessary for it to fulfill its
obligations and duties under this Agreement; provided, that following the
completion of all such obligations and duties and the satisfaction of all
expense reimbursements to which the Securityholders' Representative is
entitled in connection therewith, the Securityholders' Representative shall
distribute such amount to (i) the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Shareholders and Optionholders in respect of the Non-Withholding Options and
(ii) the Surviving Corporation for distribution to the Optionholders in
respect of the In the Money Vested Options (other than the Non-Withholding
Options), each in accordance with such Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share, it being
understood and agreed that Parent and Merger Sub's sole obligation to the
Indemnitors with respect to the Securityholders' Representative Expense Amount
shall be Parent's obligation to pay the Securityholders' Representative
Expense Amount to the Securityholders' Representative in accordance with the
first sentence of this Section 3.6 and, following such payment, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall have any further obligation with respect to payment or
delivery of the Securityholders' Representative Expense Amount to the
Indemnitors (other than to the Optionholders as set forth in clause (ii) of
this sentence, but subject to the receipt of the necessary funds from the
Securityholders' Representative).

 

3.7Escrow.

 

(a)At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (i) the Indemnification Escrow
Amount with U.S. Bank, National Association (the "Escrow Agent") for deposit
into an escrow account (the "Indemnification Escrow Account"), and (ii) the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow

 

26

Amount with the Escrow Agent for deposit into an escrow account (the "Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account"). The Escrow Funds shall be governed by the
terms of an escrow agreement to be entered into by and among Parent, the
Securityholders' Representative and the Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to
be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the "Escrow
Agreement"). Subject to Section 10.6, the Indemnification Escrow Funds shall
be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent until the date that is twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date (the "Indemnification Escrow Expiration
Date"), and shall be available to settle certain contingencies and claims as
provided in Section 3.5(e) and Article X. Each Indemnitor's portion of any
amounts contained in the Indemnification Escrow Funds which are not paid or
set aside for the satisfaction of such contingencies or claims will be
determined and distributable to the Indemnitors in accordance with Sections
3.1, 3.2 and 10.6(c) and the Escrow Agreement. The Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Funds shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent until released in
accordance with Section 3.5(e) and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b)All parties hereto agree for all Tax purposes that (i) the right of the
holders of Company Shares to the Escrow Amount shall be treated as deferred
contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale treatment under
Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or
local law, as appropriate and (ii) Parent shall be treated as the owner of the
Escrow Amount solely for Tax purposes, and all interest and earnings earned
from the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or any portion
thereof, shall be allocable to Parent pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code
and Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.468B-8. Any portion of the
proceeds payable with respect to any In the Money Vested Option that is not a
Non-Withholding Option and held in the Escrow Funds will be subject to
withholding for income and employment Taxes at such time as the amounts are
paid to the holder of such In the Money Vested Options. All parties hereto
shall file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing.

 

3.8Payment Fund; Payments to Optionholders.

 

(a)At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the Shareholders and the holders of the Non-Withholding Options,
cash in the amount payable in respect of all shares of the Capital Stock and
the Non-Withholding Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

Fund"). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than making
the payments required by Section 3.1(b)(i) and Section 3.2(a)(i), in respect
of the Company Shares and the Non-Withholding Options in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

 

(b)At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Surviving Corporation,
for the benefit of the holders of In the Money Vested Options (other than the
Non-Withholding Options), cash in the amount payable in respect of all In the
Money Vested Options, other than the Non-Withholding Options, outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(i). Such
cash shall not be used for any purpose other than making the payments required
by Section 3.2(a)(i), in respect of the In the Money Vested Options, other
than the Non-Withholding Options, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

Article IV 
CLOSING PAYMENTS; DISSENTING SHARES

 

4.1Payment of Merger Consideration.

 

(a)Attached hereto as Exhibit I is a form of letter of transmittal (a "Letter
of Transmittal"), which specifies, among other things, that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to each Company Share shall pass only
upon the delivery to the Paying Agent of a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal and such other Tax documents as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably request, together with any stock or share certificates evidencing
such Company Share (collectively, the "Required Shareholder Information"), and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Company Share in
exchange for a cash payment of the Merger Consideration at or in connection
with the Closing as more fully described below. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, at the Securityholders' Representative's
expense, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent to, mail (or deliver by any other method agreed to in writing by the
Securityholders' Representative) to each record Shareholder who has not
previously submitted a duly executed Letter of Transmittal as of the Effective
Time a form of Letter of Transmittal and instructions.

 

(b)If a Shareholder provides to Parent (or the Paying Agent) its, his or her
Required Shareholder Information at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, then Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to such
Shareholder within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date the
consideration specified in Section 3.1(b)(i). If a Shareholder provides to
Parent (or the Paying Agent) its, his or her Required Shareholder Information
any time after one (1) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then such
Shareholder shall be paid by the Paying Agent as soon as reasonably
practicable, and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, the
consideration specified in Section 3.1(b)(i). No interest will be paid or
accrued on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares
exchanged pursuant to this Section 4.1(b). If payment is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Shares are registered
in the books and records of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Person
requesting such payment has paid any transfer and other Taxes required by
reason of such payment being made in a name other than that of the registered
holder of such shares of Capital Stock so surrendered or has established to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(c)Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
paid upon the delivery to Parent of a duly executed and completed Option
Cancellation Agreement and such other Tax documents as Parent may reasonably
request from a holder of a In the Money Vested Option: (i) through the
Surviving Corporation's standard payroll practices as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event, no later than the first (1st) applicable
regularly scheduled payroll distribution following the date of the delivery of
the foregoing documents referenced in this Section 4.1(c)), to each such
holder of an In the Money Vested Option (other than Non-Withholding Options),
the consideration specified in Section 3.2(a)(i) (subject to applicable
withholding Tax), without interest; and (ii) to each such holder of a Non-
Withholding Option, the consideration specified in Section 3.2(a)(i), without
interest, paid by the Paying Agent as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date (and in any event, within two (2) Business

 

28

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 29

 



 

Days following the date of the delivery of the foregoing documents referenced
in this Section 4.1(c)).

 

(d)To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

(e)At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no further registration of transfers of shares shall thereafter be
made on the records of the Company.

 

4.2Dissenters' Rights.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by Shareholders who, in accordance with
Chapter 13 of the CCC (the "Dissenters' Rights Provisions") (i) have not
consented as part of the Shareholder Written Consent or Joinder Agreement to
adopt and approve this Agreement, (ii) shall have demanded appraisal for such
shares and complied in all respects with the Dissenters' Rights Provisions and
(iii) shall not have effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their
rights to appraisal (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), will not be
converted as described in Section 3.1, but at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive
only those rights provided under the Dissenters' Rights Provisions; provided,
however, that all shares of Capital Stock held by Shareholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal of such shares under the Dissenters' Rights Provisions shall
thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and retired and to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration provided for in Section 3.1. Persons who have perfected
statutory rights with respect to Dissenting Shares as aforesaid will not be
paid as provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are
provided by the Dissenters' Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt written notice of
any demands received by the Company for the exercise of appraisal rights with
respect to Company Shares and Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

(b)Each dissenting Shareholder who becomes entitled under the Dissenters'
Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive payment
therefor after the Effective Time from Parent (but only after the amount
thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the
Dissenters' Rights Provisions), and such Company Shares shall be cancelled.
Any amount held by the Paying Agent in respect of any such Company Shares
shall be promptly returned to Parent and retained by Parent for payment as set
forth in the foregoing sentence.

 

4.3Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each of the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation

 

29

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 30

 



 

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and
withheld) from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
In addition, the Company shall be entitled to withhold on any proceeds payable
hereunder to any Shareholder with respect to any withholding amounts
previously remitted to a taxing authority on such Shareholder's behalf and
such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been paid to such Shareholder
at the Closing.

(a)Schedule 5.8(a) sets forth all "employee benefit plans," as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), all other material benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements, and all other material stock option, bonus, severance,
retention, employment plans or agreements, in each case currently maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Company for the benefit of any current or
former employee of the Company or with respect to which the Company would
reasonably be expected to have any material liability, whether contingent or
otherwise (the "Benefit Plans"). Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates sponsors, maintains or contributes to (or is obligated to
contribute to) or has any liability under or with respect to any "employee
pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA). None of the Benefit Plans provide for
post-employment life or health insurance benefits for any participant or any
beneficiary of a

 

39

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 40

 



 

participant, except as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (or similar state law) and at the
expense of the participant or the participant's beneficiary.

 

(b)The Benefit Plans have been administered in all material respects in
accordance with the terms of such Benefit Plans and all applicable laws
including ERISA and the Code. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a "401(k) Plan") has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS regarding its
qualification thereunder. No material litigation or governmental
administrative proceeding, audit or other proceeding (other than those
relating to routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Benefit Plan. All material
payments and/or contributions required to have been made with respect to all
Benefit Plans either have been made or have been accrued in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan and applicable law.

 

(c)Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on
Schedule 5.8(c), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) (i) result in any payment becoming due to
any employee or other service provider of the Company, (ii) increase any
benefits otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any
such Benefit Plan or (iv) give rise to a (or already has resulted in a)
payment or provision of any other benefit (including accelerated vesting) that
could not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or could be
subject to an excise Tax under Code Section 4999 (in each case, determined
without regard to the exceptions provided for in Section 280G(b)(5) (and any
waivers obtained pursuant to Section 8.2)).

 

(d)The per share exercise price of each Company Option is no less than the
fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of such
Company Option determined in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the
Code. Each Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been
operated and maintained in all material respects in operational and
documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance
thereunder.

 

(e)There have been no "prohibited transactions" that have resulted in or would
result in a material liability (as described in section 406 of ERISA or
section 4975 of the Code that is not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and
regulatory guidance thereunder) with respect to any Benefit Plan and none of
the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any prohibited
transaction.

 

(f)The Company, and each Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" as defined
in Section 733(a)(1) of ERISA (a "Health Plan") is currently in compliance in
all material respects with the Healthcare Reform Laws and no event has
occurred, and no conditions or circumstances exist, that would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or any Health Plan to material penalties that
or excise taxes under Sections 4980D, 4980H or 4980I of the Code. To the
Company's knowledge, there have been no acts by the Company which have given,
or could reasonably be expected to give, rise to any material interest, fines,
penalties, taxes or related

 

40

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 41

 



 

charges under Chapters 43, 47 or 100 of the Code for which the Company has or
could reasonably be expected to have liability.

 

(g)Each Benefit Plan may be amended, terminated, or otherwise modified by the
Company to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, including the
elimination of any and all future benefit accruals thereunder and no employee
communications or provision of any Benefit Plan has failed to effectively
reserve the right of the Company to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify
such Employee Benefit Plan.

on Schedule 5.17); and

Code Section 4999, a waiver of such Person's rights to all of such payments

cause any of its Affiliates or the Company to take or agree to take) any other
action or to agree (or cause any of its Affiliates or the Company to agree) to
any limitation or restriction on any of its businesses, product lines or
assets; or (ii) to commence or contest any legal proceeding relating to the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall not, and Parent shall not permit any of its Affiliates
to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or
division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration
or otherwise), if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially
increase the risk of not obtaining expeditiously any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger or

liability of, each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company (each, a "DandO Indemnified Party" and collectively, the

 

64

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 65

 



 

"DandO Indemnified Parties") provided for in the Company's Charter Documents, in
each case solely with respect to any period prior to the Closing, shall
continue in full force and effect indefinitely, except, in each case, as
required by applicable law.

 

(b)At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and

following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage and have
other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company (the "Tail Insurance Policy"). Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain the Tail Insurance Policy in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery for any claims covered by
such Tail Insurance Policy.

 

(c)The obligations under this Section 8.7 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to whom this

being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this Section
8.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.7 and shall

obligations set forth in this Section 8.7.

 

8.8Books and Records. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of the Parent's Subsidiaries to, until the fifth (5th) anniversary of
the Closing Date or any later date to the extent required by applicable law,
retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business of
the Company in existence on the Closing Date and to make the same reasonably
available for inspection and copying by the Securityholders' Representative or
any of the representatives of the Securityholders' Representative at the
expense of the Securityholders' Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) during the normal business hours of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or such Subsidiary, as applicable, upon reasonable request and
upon reasonable notice, to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with
any legitimate matter relating to or affected by the operations of the Company
prior to the Closing Date, except for any such matter related to any
proceeding by Securityholders' Representative or any Securityholder or any of
their respective representatives against, or that is or would be reasonably
expected to become adverse in any material respect to, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent's Subsidiaries, in which case access to such books and
records shall be governed by the applicable rules of discovery; provided, that
(i) any such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent's Subsidiaries and
(ii) neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of Parent's
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to provide any access to any documents or data
which they are prohibited from doing so pursuant to applicable

 

65

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 66

 



 

law or contractual restriction or which, in the reasonable good faith judgment
of Parent, constitutes competitively sensitive information or would reasonably
be expected to compromise or constitute a waiver of any attorney-client
privilege of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent's Subsidiaries,
provided, further, that in the case of the foregoing clause (ii), Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent's Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the disclosure of such information (or as much of
it as reasonably possible) in a manner that would not result in a violation of
applicable Law or result in the disclosure of competitively sensitive
information or a waiver of any attorney-client privilege.

 

8.9Tax Matters.

 

(a)Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns. Parent shall timely prepare and
file, or shall cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Company
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and Pre-Closing Straddle Period
that are due after the Closing Date. Parent shall prepare such Tax Returns
consistent with past practices of the Company (unless otherwise required by a
change in applicable law). Parent shall provide the Securityholders'
Representative any such income Tax Return or other Tax Return which could form
the basis for an indemnification claim pursuant to Article X no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return for the
Securityholders' Representative review. Parent shall (i) obtain the approval
of the Securityholders' Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) with respect to any such Tax Return that
solely relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) incorporate any reasonable
comments of the Securityholders' Representative with respect to any such Tax
Return that solely relates to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period. Parent shall
cause any amounts shown to be due on such Tax Returns to be timely remitted to
the applicable Governmental Body before such Taxes are due.

 

(b)Negative Tax Covenants. Without the prior written consent of the
Securityholders' Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall, with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, make or change
any Tax election, adopt or change any Tax accounting method, file any Tax
Return other than pursuant to Section 8.9(a) (including amended Tax Returns),
or surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, if such election, adoption,
change, filing, amendment, or surrender could have the effect of increasing
the Tax liability of the Indemnitors or any of their respective direct or
indirect owners, increasing the amount the Parent Indemnified Parties may seek
indemnity for under this Agreement, or decreasing any amount payable to the
Indemnitors pursuant to Section 8.9(f). In addition, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall make any election under Sections 338 or 336(e) of the
Code or any state, local or foreign law equivalent in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c)Closing Date Course of Business. For the portion of the Closing Date after
the time of Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to carry on
its business only in the ordinary course in the same manner as previously
conducted.

 

(d)End of Tax Year. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not take any
action, or permit any action to be taken, that may prevent the Tax year of the
Company from ending for U.S. federal and applicable state, local and foreign
income Tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing Date.

 

66

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 67

 



 

(e)Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Securityholders' Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with (i) the filing
of Tax Returns (including, for the avoidance of doubt, assisting with the
calculation of, and providing information relating to, the Company's current
and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
relation to the transactions effected under the Separation Agreement) or of
any amended Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and Pre-Closing Straddle
Period; (ii) any Pre-Closing Tax Contests, Tax audits, Tax proceedings or
other Tax-related claims; and (iii) providing certificates or forms, and
timely executing any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate to
establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax. Such
cooperation shall include, upon the Securityholders' Representative's request,
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information, and explaining any materials provided pursuant to this
Section 8.9(e). Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries shall not destroy or dispose of any Tax workpapers, schedules or
other materials and documents supporting Tax Returns of the Company for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitation.

 

(f)Tax Refunds. The Indemnitors shall be entitled to receive from Parent or
Surviving Corporation all refunds (or credits for overpayments) of Taxes,
including any interest thereon, attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.
Promptly upon receipt of any such Tax refund (or credits for overpayment), and
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after receipt by Parent or
Surviving Corporation, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, deliver and pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
such Tax refunds (or credits for overpayments), net of the amount of any Taxes
or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in obtaining such refund (or credits for overpayments). Nothing
in this Section 8.9(f) shall require that Parent Indemnified Party make any
payment with respect to any refund for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for
the benefit of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation) that is with respect
to (A) any refund of Tax that is the result of the carrying back of any net
operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit incurred in a taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date; (B) any refund
of an Indemnified Tax paid after the Closing Date to the extent the
Securityholders have not indemnified such Parent Indemnified Party or the
Company for such Taxes; (C) any refund for Tax that is reflected as a current
asset (or offset to a current liability) in the calculation of Net Working
Capital or included in the calculation of Indebtedness, in each case, as
finally determined; or (D) any refund for Tax that gives rise to a payment
obligation by the Company to any Person under applicable law or pursuant to a
provision of a contract entered (or assumed) by the Company on or prior to the
Closing Date.

 

(g)Allocation for Straddle Periods. In the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the
portion of Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period that
begins before the Closing Date and ends on and includes the Closing Date (the
"Pre-Closing Straddle Period") shall: (i) in the case any Taxes in the form of
interest and penalties, be deemed to include all such Taxes to the extent
relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period
whether such items are incurred, accrued, assessed, or similarly charged on,
before, or after the Closing Date; (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on the
Company, Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party as a result of income of
any Flow-Thru Entity realized prior to the Closing Date (such income being
computed assuming the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends on the Closing
Date and closed its books), be deemed

 

67

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 68

 



 

to include all such Taxes; (iii) in the case of any Taxes or refunds of Taxes
(or credits for overpayment of Taxes) measured by income, gross receipts,
payments, sales, or payroll of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date; and (iv) in the case of personal property, real
property, ad valorem and other similar Taxes of the Company imposed on a
periodic basis during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such
other Tax or refund of other Tax (or credit or overpayment) for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 

(h)Transfer Taxes. Any sales, use, transfer, stamp, duties, recording and
similar Taxes incurred as a result of the Contemplated Transactions
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") arising under or related to the Separation
Agreement, if applicable, shall be borne by the Securityholders (unless
otherwise satisfied by SupplyPike). All other Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be borne one-half by Parent and one-half by the Securityholders. Parent shall
prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to Transfer Taxes and timely remit all such Transfer Taxes.

 

(i)Tax Contests. Parent shall have the right to control any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns of the Company that
relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period (a "Pre-
Closing Tax Contest"); provided, however, that if the Securityholders could be
obligated to indemnify Parent under this Agreement, the Securityholders'
Representative shall have the right to participate in (at its own expense);
provided, further, Parent shall not settle or compromise any such Pre-Closing
Tax Contest that relates to an Indemnified Tax or any other claim for
indemnification related to or arising out of Tax matters (including, without
limitation, a breach of any representation or warranty in Section 5.7, Section
5.5(r) or Section 5.8) without the Securityholders' Representative's prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Parent shall provide the Securityholders' Representative with prompt notice of
any written inquiries by a taxing authority relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Contest within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such notice. To the extent
that this Section 8.9(i) is inconsistent with Section 10.4 as to any Tax
matters, this Section 8.9(i) shall control.

 

8.10Further Action. Each of the parties hereto shall use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate
action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable and
execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective
the Contemplated Transactions.

 

8.11No Solicitation.

 

(a)During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and will take such
action as is reasonably necessary to direct that its directors, officers,
advisors and other authorized representatives do not, directly or indirectly,
initiate or solicit, or knowingly facilitate or encourage, any inquiries
regarding, or the making or implementation of, any Acquisition Proposal.
During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall notify Parent in writing
promptly but in any

 

68

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 69

 



 

event within forty-eight (48) hours following the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal (which notice shall include the material terms thereof, except to the
extent that the disclosure thereof would constitute a breach of any obligation
of confidentiality of the Company with respect thereto).

 

(b)The Company will not, and will take such action as is reasonably necessary
to direct that its directors, officers, advisors and other authorized
representatives do not, directly or indirectly, (i) discuss, negotiate,
undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, either as the proposed
surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired corporation, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person or
entity, any information concerning the business, operations, properties or
assets of the Company in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv)
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, or
facilitate, any effort or attempt by any other Person or entity to do or seek
any of the foregoing.

 

(c)The Company shall, and shall direct its directors, officers, advisors and
other authorized representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons or
entities (other than Parent and Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect
to any of the foregoing. The Company agrees not to release any third party
from the confidentiality provisions of any agreement to which the Company is a
party.

 

8.12RandW Insurance Policy. On the date hereof, Parent has bound a
representations and warranties insurance policy in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit K (the "RandW Insurance Policy") for the benefit of the Parent and the
other Parent Indemnified Parties with a retention amount of $2,520,000, except
for breaches of the Fundamental Representations and the Tax Representations
for which the initial retention amount shall be $1,260,000. The premium and
fees of the insurer of the RandW Insurance Policy in respect thereof will be
borne fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the
Securityholders (in the case of the Securityholders, as Company Transaction
Expenses).

 

8.13Closing Bonuses. At or promptly following the Closing Date, but in any
event no later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, the Company
shall pay the Closing Bonuses to the employees of the Company listed on the
Closing Bonuses Schedule in the amounts listed thereon. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall deliver bonus award letters to such employees giving them
notice of such bonuses, which letters shall be in form and substance
satisfactory to Parent and the Company (it being agreed and understood by
Parent and the Company that such letters shall not include a release unless
otherwise agreed upon by Parent and the Company). The parties agree that the

10.1Survival. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article V, the Pre-Closing Covenants and the certifications in the Closing
Certificate with respect thereto and with respect to Section 9.2(h), and the
right of a Parent Indemnified Party to bring an Indemnity Claim in respect
thereof, shall survive the Closing until 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the

Claim Notice shall survive until such time as such Indemnity Claim is fully
and finally resolved. The parties further acknowledge and agree that the time
periods set forth in this Article X for the assertion of Indemnity Claims are

extent arising out of, or related to, the failure of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Affiliates or representatives to perform any covenant,
obligation, action or undertaking to the extent required to be performed by
the Surviving Corporation or such Affiliate or representative at, or at any
time following the Effective Time pursuant to any of the SupplyPike

or any of its Affiliates or designees pursuant to the terms of the License

any Indebtedness or Unpaid Transaction Expenses to the extent not included in

any exercise by any Shareholder of its rights under the Dissenters' Rights
Provisions in connection with the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions)
(the matters set forth in Section 10.2(a) and Section 10.2(b) are referred to
herein as "Indemnifiable Matters").

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(except as set forth in Section 10.2(f)), Parent Indemnified Parties'
indemnification rights pursuant to Section 10.2(a) shall be limited as
follows:

 

(i)The Parent Indemnified Parties' sole source of recovery with respect to
Losses resulting from the Indemnifiable Matters under Section 10.2(a) shall be
limited to the Indemnification Escrow Funds (the "Escrow Cap").

 

(ii)The Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled pursuant to Section
10.2(a) to recover only for (A) any Loss resulting from the Indemnifiable
Matters thereunder that exceeds $27,500 per event or series of related events
(the "Minimum Threshold") and (B) any Losses resulting from the Indemnifiable
Matters thereunder to the extent that the total of all such Losses above the
Minimum Threshold with respect to such matters exceeds $1,260,000 (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, only the amount of such excess) (the "Retention
Basket").

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(except as set forth in Section 10.2(f)), Parent Indemnified Parties'
indemnification rights pursuant to Section 10.2(a) and Section 10.2(b) shall
be limited as set forth in Section 10.5 and as follows:

 

(i)In calculating amounts payable to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Article X, the amount of any Losses shall be computed net of (A) any
insurance proceeds actually received by any Parent Indemnified Party on
account of such Losses (including, as applicable, pursuant to the Tail
Insurance Policy or the RandW Insurance Policy), in each case net of the cost of
obtaining such recovery from the applicable insurance policy, including
collection costs and costs, if any, of premium adjustments with respect to
such insurance attributable to such recovery, and (B) any payment from any
third party pursuant to any indemnification or contribution arrangement or
otherwise, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any indemnification or
contribution payment by SupplyPike pursuant to any of the SupplyPike
Agreements, in each case, net of the cost of obtaining such recovery from such
third party, including collection costs. In the event that an insurance
(including pursuant to the Tail Insurance Policy or the RandW Insurance Policy)
or other recovery is made by any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any
Loss for which any Parent Indemnified Party has been indemnified hereunder,
then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the net recovery shall be
promptly delivered by Parent (or its agent) to the Indemnitors (based on each
such Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share) or the Joining Parties (based on each such
Joining Party's Pro Rata Share), as the case may be (or, to the extent such
recovery was made from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, to the Indemnitors
based on each such Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share or, if such refund is made
prior to the Indemnification Escrow Expiration Date, to the Indemnification
Escrow Funds) in accordance with the instructions of the Securityholders'
Representative. For the avoidance of doubt, no Parent Indemnified Party shall
be required to refund any amounts recovered under the RandW Insurance Policy to
the extent such refund would, after taking into account

 

76

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 77

 



 

the deductible and other limitations under the RandW Insurance Policy, have the
effect of reducing the amount of indemnifiable Losses actually recovered by
the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to such claim below the amount of
indemnified Losses to which the Parent Indemnified Parties would otherwise be
entitled to recover from the Indemnitors or the Joining Parties pursuant to
this Article X, but for this Section 10(d)(i). Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and each other Parent Indemnified Party shall take all steps
required under applicable law to mitigate, and in any event shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies as
promptly as practicable for, any Losses for which indemnification may be
claimed by any of them under this Agreement.

 

(ii)No breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein shall give rise to any right on the part of a Parent, Merger Sub, or
other Parent Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, to rescind this Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions (other than to the extent such right may not be waived under
applicable law).

 

(iii)Any Loss for which any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Section 10.2 shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Loss would allow for recovery under more than one Indemnifiable Matter or as a
result of breaches of more than one of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement. No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement for any Loss to the extent such Loss was
already reflected or otherwise reserved for in the calculation of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration at the Closing.

 

(iv)No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under
this Article X for punitive damages unless such damages are awarded by a court
to a third party claimant in a Third Party Claim for which such Parent
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article X.

 

(v)(A) Nothing in this Article X shall restrict or prohibit Parent from making
and pursuing any claim under the RandW Insurance Policy obtained by the Parent
in connection with this Agreement, and (B) the claims period and limitations
under the RandW Insurance Policy may differ from the terms herein but shall have
no effect on the indemnification obligations of the Indemnitors or the Joining
Parties hereunder.

 

(vi)The Parent Indemnified Parties' sole remedy for Losses attributable to any
breach of a Tax Representation (other than Sections 5.7(a)(viii), (ix),
(xiii), (xvi) or (xviii)) shall be limited to Taxes incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the Indemnitors shall
have no liability or indemnification obligation for any Losses relating to
Taxes resulting from any action taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the ordinary course
of business.

 

(vii)In calculating amounts payable to any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Article X, the amount of any Losses shall be computed net of any Tax
savings or benefits actually realized in the year of the Loss or the following
taxable year by the Parent Indemnified Party or its Affiliates that is
attributable to any deduction, loss,

 

77

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 78

 



 

credit, refund or other reduction in Tax resulting from or arising out of such
Loss, in each case computed at the actual effective Tax rate applicable to the
applicable Parent Indemnified Party or such Affiliates.

 

(viii)The representations and warranties made by the Company in Article V
shall in no event be affected by (A) any investigation, inquiry or examination
made for or on behalf of any of the Parent Indemnified Parties, (B) any
knowledge of any of the Parent Indemnified Parties or their respective
officers, directors, managers, equityholders, employees or agents or (C) the
acceptance by Parent or Merger Sub of any certificate delivered by or on
behalf of the Company hereunder.

 

(ix)For purposes of determining whether there has been any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Article V
and the amount of Losses arising therefrom, each representation and warranty
in this Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving effect to
the term, or, as applicable, clause containing "material," "material adverse
effect," "Company Material Adverse Effect," "except as would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect" or similar phrases or clauses contained in
such representation or warranty the inclusion of which would limit or
potentially limit a claim by any Parent Indemnified Party under this Article X
(as if such word or clause, as applicable, were deleted from such
representation and warranty).

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(except as set forth in Section 10.2(f)), the total aggregate liability of
each Indemnitor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in such Indemnitor's
capacity as a Joining Party) under this Agreement shall not exceed such
Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Cap to the extent actually
received by such Indemnitor (inclusive of such Indemnitor's interest in the
Indemnity Escrow Funds, the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds and the
Securityholders' Representative Expense Funds) (the "Individual Aggregate
Cap"). The "Aggregate Cap" means an amount equal to (i) the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (as finally determined) minus (ii) $25,200,000.

 

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article X, there
shall be no limitation on the liability of any Indemnitor, any Joining Party,
the Company or any other Person in respect of Actual Fraud committed by such
Indemnitor, Joining Party, the Company or any other Person, other than the
Individual Aggregate Cap with respect to the total aggregate liability of each
Indemnitor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in such Indemnitor's
capacity as a Joining Party) under this Agreement with respect to Actual Fraud
committed by the Company (it being understood and agreed upon that the
Individual Aggregate Cap shall not apply with respect to Actual Fraud
committed by such Indemnitor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in such
Indemnitor's capacity as a Joining Party)).

 

10.3Claims for Indemnification.

 

(a)The period during which an Indemnity Claim for a particular Indemnifiable
Matter under this Article X may be made (the "Claims Period") shall be the
Survival Period applicable to such Indemnifiable Matter. Any Indemnity Claims
made with respect to an Indemnifiable Matter after the applicable Claims
Period for such Indemnifiable Matter shall be barred, and the Indemnitors and
the Joining Parties shall have no liability with respect thereto.

 

78

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 79

 



 

(b)If a Parent Indemnified Party wishes to bring an Indemnity Claim hereunder,
the Parent Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice (a "Claim
Notice") thereof to the Securityholders' Representative; provided, that the
failure to so notify the Securityholders' Representative promptly shall not
relieve the Indemnitors or the Joining Parties of their obligations under this
Article X with respect to the Indemnity Claim asserted in the Claim Notice,
except to the extent prejudiced by such failure or delay. The Claim Notice
shall specify the Indemnifiable Matter that is the basis for the Indemnity
Claim (including, if applicable, the specific representation, warranty,
covenant or certification claimed to be breached), the Losses incurred by, or
reasonably anticipated to be incurred by, the Parent Indemnified Party on
account thereof and the facts and circumstances giving rise to such Indemnity
Claim, set forth in reasonable detail. The Claim Notice may be updated and
amended from time to time prior to the resolution of the Indemnity Claim set
forth therein by the Parent Indemnified Party by delivering an updated or
amended Claim Notice to the Securityholders' Representative, so long as the
delivery of the original Claim Notice is made within the applicable Claims
Period and such update or amendment relates to the underlying facts and
circumstances specifically set forth in such original Claim Notice. If an
objection has been timely made by the Securityholders' Representative under
Section 10.3(c) with respect to a Claim Notice which Claim Notice is
subsequently updated or amended, the Securityholders' Representative will be
deemed to have objected to such updated or amended Claim Notice unless
otherwise agreed by the Securityholders' Representative in writing. If the
Securityholders' Representative did not so object to the original Claim
Notice, the provisions of Section 10.3(c) (including the Securityholders'
Representative right to object to the updated or amended Claim Notice) shall
apply to the updated or amended Claim Notice, mutatis mutandis. The Parent
Indemnified Party shall include with each Claim Notice the documentation and
other information within its possession and control supporting the matters
asserted in the Claim Notice or any amendment or update thereto, and such
additional materials in its possession and control that form the basis for
such claims as reasonably requested by the Securityholders' Representative, it
being understood and agreed that the Parent Indemnified Party shall have no
obligation to provide any materials subject to attorney-client privilege or
that constitute attorney work product absent a customary joint defense
agreement or similar arrangement that is reasonably acceptable to the Parent
Indemnified Party and the Securityholders' Representative.

 

(c)Unless the Securityholders' Representative objects to the Indemnity Claim
in a writing delivered to the Parent Indemnified Party or Parent within thirty
(30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice (which written notice will describe
in reasonable detail the basis for objecting to the Indemnity Claim, including
the amount of the Losses disputed or reasonably anticipated to be disputed),
the Parent Indemnified Party shall, subject to the other terms of this Article
X, be entitled to receive in respect of the Indemnity Claim set forth in such
Claim Notice the amount of Losses that are specified in such Claim Notice (or
if only a portion of such Losses are disputed, such portion of Losses that are
undisputed). Any disputed Indemnity Claims shall be resolved either (i) in a
written agreement signed by the relevant Parent Indemnified Party and the
Securityholders' Representative or (ii) by the final, non-appealable decision
of a court resolving such disputed Indemnity Claim in accordance with Section
13.7.

 

10.4Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or commencement by any
third party of any claim, litigation, action, suit, arbitration or other
similar proceeding with respect to which any Indemnitor or Joining Party may
become obligated to indemnify a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article X (a "Third Party Claim"), Parent shall assume the defense or

 

79

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 80

 



 

handling of such Third Party Claim and shall defend against such Third Party
Claim in good faith. The Securityholders' Representative shall have the right
to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to
the Third Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents by the
Securityholders' Representative does not adversely affect any privilege
relating to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party and Parent shall provide
the Securityholders' Representative the opportunity to consult with and
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense of the Third
Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the Third Party Claim,
all at the sole expense of the Indemnitors or the Joining Parties, as the case
may be. No Parent Indemnified Party shall have any right to be indemnified
for any such Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised without the
prior written consent of the Securityholders' Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which consent
shall be deemed to have been given unless the Securityholders' Representative
shall have objected within thirty (30) days after written request for such
consent by Parent.

 

10.5Payment of Indemnifiable Losses.

 

(a)All Losses for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to be
indemnified for under Section 10.2(a) shall be recovered (subject to the

capacity as a Joining Party), to such Indemnitor's Individual Aggregate Cap,
and any other applicable limitations set forth in this Article X): (i) first,
from the Indemnification Escrow Funds; (ii) second, from the RandW Insurance
Policy (up to its limits if such matter is covered by the RandW Insurance

are not otherwise covered by, the RandW Insurance Policy, at Parent's sole
option, directly from the Joining Parties in accordance with their Joining

combination of the foregoing.

 

(c)All Losses for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to be

to any Carveout Matter that may be covered by the RandW Insurance Policy) shall

Retention Basket, but subject, with respect to each Indemnitor (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in such Indemnitor's capacity as a Joining Party), to

doubt, in such Indemnitor's capacity as a Joining Party), to such Indemnitor's
Individual Aggregate Cap, and any other applicable limitations set forth in
this Article X): (i) first, at Parent's sole option, from the Indemnification
Escrow Funds or by way of set-off pursuant to Section 10.8 or any combination
of the foregoing and (ii) second, when there are no longer Indemnification
Escrow Funds held by the Escrow Agent and the right of set-off is no longer
available, directly from the Joining Parties in accordance with their Joining
Party Pro Rata Shares.

 

10.6Release of Indemnification Escrow Funds.

Indemnification Escrow Expiration Date, the then remaining Indemnification

The amount of any Indemnification Escrow Funds to be so delivered to the
Indemnitors shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent. Any portion of
Indemnification Escrow Funds to be so delivered to Indemnitors that is
remaining after such rounding shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the
Indemnitors in an equitable manner, as determined in good faith by the Escrow
Agent and taking into account the Indemnitors' respective Pro Rata Shares.

nor any Securityholder shall have any liability to Parent or Merger Sub in
respect of, any breach by the Company or any Securityholder of any
representations or warranties contained herein or in any agreement delivered
in connection herewith or any failure to comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions contained herein or in any side agreement, except (i)
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1, in which event, the
Company and the Securityholders shall thereupon have no obligation or
liability to Parent or Merger Sub whatsoever hereunder except as otherwise
provided in Section 11.2 or (ii) to seek specific performance or injunctive
relief pursuant to Section 13.13.

 

(b)The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as set forth in
Section 11.2, prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor any Securityholder
shall have any right or remedy to take any action in respect of, and neither
Parent or Merger Sub shall have any liability to the Company or any
Securityholder in respect of, any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any
representations or warranties contained herein or in any agreement delivered
in connection herewith or any failure to comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions contained herein or in any side agreement, except (i)
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1, in which event, Parent
or Merger Sub shall thereupon have no obligation or liability to the Company
or any Securityholder whatsoever hereunder except as otherwise provided in
Section 11.2 or (ii) to seek specific performance or injunctive relief
pursuant to Section 13.13.

 

(c)Except for equitable remedies pursuant to Section 13.13 and in the event of
Actual Fraud (subject however in any event to equivalent limitations set forth
in Section 10.2(f)), from and after the Effective Time, the rights to
indemnification under this Article X and the provisions of Section 3.5 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties for any
Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out of this Agreement or the
Merger.

 

10.8Set-Off. Subject to the following sentence, if the Joining Parties are
obligated to indemnify Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Parties for any
Indemnity Claim in accordance with Article X or make any payment to Parent
pursuant to Section 3.5(e)(i), Parent may set-off the amount of Losses of such
Indemnity Claim or the amount of such payment due pursuant to Section
3.5(e)(i) against any amounts payable by the Company or Parent or any other
Parent Indemnified Party to SupplyPike under the License or any other
agreement contemplated hereunder, as the same becomes due, in an amount not to
exceed $3,000,000. If Parent intends to set-off any amount for any Indemnity
Claim hereunder, Parent shall provide prior written notice to Securityholders'
Representative of its intention to do so, together with a reasonably detailed
explanation of the basis therefor (a "Set-Off Notice"). If, within ten (10)
days of its receipt of a Set-Off Notice, the Securityholders' Representative
provides Parent with written notice of the Securityholders' Representative's
dispute with the Parent's right to make such set-off, Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to
resolve their dispute for a period of ten (10) days. If such dispute remains
unresolved despite such good faith negotiations, Parent may withhold the
amount contemplated by the Set-Off Notice until the matter is resolved. If it
is finally determined that the Parent's claim is valid, then Parent may effect
the set-off contemplated by the Set-Off Notice. If it is finally determined
that Parent's claim is not valid, then

 

82

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 83

 



 

Parent shall promptly pay to Securityholders' Representative the amount
withheld pursuant to the Set-Off Notice. Parent may effect the set-off with
respect to any payment due pursuant to Section 3.5(e)(i) by delivering written
notice to Securityholders' Representative of such set-off. For purposes of
this Section 10.8, "finally determined" means that the validity and amount of
such Indemnity Claim has either been (i) agreed to in a written agreement
signed by the relevant Parent Indemnified Party and the Securityholders'
Representative or (ii) determined by the final, non-appealable decision of a
court resolving such disputed Indemnity Claim in accordance with Section 13.7.

 

10.9Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All payments made pursuant to this
Article X shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for Tax
purposes and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

Article XI 
TERMINATION

 

11.1Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, as follows:

 

(a)by the mutual written consent of Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger
Sub) and the Company;

 

(b)by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, by
written notice to the other if any Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued an injunction or taken any other action that permanently
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Merger, and
such injunction or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;

 

(c)by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, by
written notice to the other, if the consummation of the Merger shall not have
occurred on or before January 31, 2019 (the "Termination Date"); provided,
however, that (A) the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
11.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure (or, in the case of
Parent, Merger Sub's failure) to comply with any provision of this Agreement
has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the
Merger to occur on or before the Termination Date and (B) the parties may
mutually agree to extend the Termination Date if the failure to consummate the
Merger is due to regulatory or antitrust issues;

 

(d)by the Company, if the Company is not then in material breach of any term
of this Agreement, upon written notice to Parent if there occurs a breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant of Parent or Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement, and which breach, in the absence of a cure within thirty (30)
days following delivery of such written notice to Parent, would cause any of
the closing conditions set forth in Sections 9.1 or 9.3 to not be satisfied,
and which breach has continued without cure for a period of thirty (30) days
following delivery of such written notice to Parent;

 

(e)by Parent or Merger Sub, if neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in
material breach of any term of this Agreement, upon written notice to the
Company if there occurs a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
of the Company contained in this Agreement, and

 

83

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 84

 



 

which breach, in the absence of a cure within thirty (30) days following
delivery of such written notice to the Company, would cause any of the closing
conditions set forth in Sections 9.1 or 9.2 to not be satisfied, and which
breach has continued without cure for a period of thirty (30) days following
delivery of such written notice to the Company; or

 

(f)by Parent if written consents adopting this Agreement and approving the
Merger by the Required Shareholder Vote shall not have been delivered to the
Company, with a copy thereof delivered to Parent, within forty-eight (48)
hours after the execution and delivery of this Agreement; provided, that if
such written consents are provided prior to Parent terminating this Agreement,
Parent's termination right under this clause (f) will be terminated and have
no further force and effect.

 

11.2Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and have no effect, without any liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, shareholders or other representatives, and all
rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except that the
agreements contained in Section 8.4, this Article XI and Article XIII shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, that nothing herein shall
relieve any party hereto from liability resulting from any willful breach of
such party's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein prior to such termination, or any intentional fraud of such party.

 

Article XII 
SECURITYHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE

 

12.1Appointment. By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement
by the Required Shareholder Vote and without any further action of any other

connection with the Contemplated Transactions that provide for actions to be
taken by the Securityholders' Representative (collectively, the "SR
Agreements"). The Securityholders' Representative shall have full power and
authority to take all actions under the SR Agreements on behalf on the
Securityholders or any Securityholder. The Securityholders' Representative

AmericasActive:12666190.14 85

 



 

12.2Authorization. Without limiting the foregoing and in furtherance thereof,
the Securityholders' Representative is hereby authorized to:

 

(a)receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the
Securityholders pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or therewith and to
receive and accept services of legal process in connection with any suit or
proceeding arising under any SR Agreement;

 

(b)engage counsel, accountants and other advisors, and incur other expenses in
connection with the SR Agreements and the Contemplated Transactions, as the
Securityholders' Representative may in its sole discretion deem necessary or
appropriate; and

 

(c)take such action as the Securityholders' Representative may in its sole
discretion deem necessary or appropriate in respect of: (i) waiving any
inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered by Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant hereto; (ii) taking such other action as the Securityholders'
Representative is authorized to take under any SR Agreement; (iii) receiving
all documents or certificates and making all determinations, in its capacity
as Securityholders' Representative, required under any SR Agreement; and (iv)
taking all such actions as may be necessary to carry out the responsibilities
of the Securityholders' Representative contemplated by any SR Agreement,
including the defense and/or settlement of any Indemnity Claim and any waiver
of any obligation of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders' Representative shall have
no obligation to act on behalf of the Securityholders, except as expressly
provided in its engagement letter entered into in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, herein and in the other SR Agreements.

 

12.3Agency. The Securityholders' Representative shall have no liability to
the Securityholders with respect to any action taken, decision made or
instruction given by the Securityholders' Representative in connection with
the SR Agreements to the extent that any such actions, decisions or
instructions have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to result from the Securityholders' Representative's fraud, gross negligence
or willful misconduct. All action of the Securityholders' Representative in
accordance with the SR Agreements shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside this Agreement and shall be binding on all Securityholders and their
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such
Securityholders.

 

12.4Indemnification of Securityholders' Representative; Limitations of
Liability. Certain Securityholders have entered into an engagement agreement
with the Securityholders' Representative to provide direction to the
Securityholders' Representative in connection with its services under the SR
Agreements (such Securityholders, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory Group"). The
Securityholders' Representative Group (as defined below) shall be indemnified
and defended by the Securityholders for and shall be held harmless against any
Loss, claim, damages, fees, costs, liability or expense (including fees,
disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or amounts
paid in settlement incurred by the Securityholders' Representative Group (as
defined below), in each case, relating to the Securityholders'

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to result from the
Securityholders'

 

85

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 86

 



 

Representative's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection
with its performance under this Agreement or any SR Agreement. This
indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The
Securityholders' Representative shall have the right to cause the satisfaction
of some or all of such indemnification obligations using, first, any then
available proceeds contained in the Securityholders' Representative Expense
Fund, second, from any distribution of Escrow Funds otherwise distributable to
the Securityholders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from the
Securityholders, severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis based on the
amount actually received by each such Securityholder of the Merger
Consideration. The Securityholders acknowledge that the Securityholders'
Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any
of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to any SR Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions. Furthermore, the Securityholders'
Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Securityholders' Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Securityholders' Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in performing
such actions. The Securityholders' Representative may, in all questions
arising under this Agreement or any SR Agreement, rely on the advice of
counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Securityholders' Representative in accordance with such advice, and the
Securityholders' Representative shall not be liable to the Securityholders or
any other Person in connection therewith. In no event shall the
Securityholders' Representative be liable hereunder or in connection herewith
for any indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages. Neither the
Securityholders' Representative, any member of the Advisory Group nor any of
its or their respective members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,
agents and employees (collectively, the "Securityholders' Representative
Group"), shall be liable to any Securityholder for any action taken or omitted
by the Securityholders' Representative under any SR Agreement, or in
connection therewith, except that the Securityholders' Representative shall
not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

 

12.5Access to Information. The Securityholders' Representative shall be given
access by Parent to all information of and concerning any Indemnity Claim and
which is in the possession, custody or control of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and the reasonable assistance of Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's officers and employees for purposes of performing the
Securityholders' Representative's duties under this Agreement and exercising
its rights under this Agreement, including for the purpose of evaluating any
Indemnity Claim by any Parent Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the
Securityholders' Representative shall treat confidentially and not, except in
connection with enforcing its rights under this Agreement or any SR Agreement,
disclose any nonpublic information from or concerning any Indemnity Claim to
anyone (except to the Securityholders' Representative's attorneys, accountants
or other advisers, to Securityholders and on a need-to-know basis to other
individuals who agree to keep such information confidential).

 

12.6Reasonable Reliance.

 

(a)In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Securityholders'
Representative shall be entitled to (a) rely upon any signature, document or
instrument reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and
signed by any Securityholders or any party

 

86

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 87

 



 

hereunder, (b) assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in
accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so and
(c) rely upon the Consideration Spreadsheet.

 

(b)Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision, action,
failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Securityholders' Representative
with respect to any matter within the Securityholders' Representative's
authorization under this Article XII or under any SR Agreement shall
constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure
to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of all the Securityholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such Securityholder; and Parent, each Parent
Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any such
notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as
being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of, each and every such Securityholder. Parent, each
Parent Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with any such
notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of
the Securityholders' Representative.

 

12.7Orders. The Securityholders' Representative is authorized, in its sole
discretion, to comply with final, nonappealable orders or decisions issued or
process entered by any court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the
Escrow Funds. If any portion of the Escrow Funds is disbursed to the
Securityholders' Representative and is at any time attached, garnished or
levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then
and in any such event, the Securityholders' Representative is authorized, in
its sole discretion, but in good faith, to rely upon and comply with any such
order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected
by it is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and if
the Securityholders' Representative complies with any such order, writ,
judgment or decree, he shall not be liable to any Securityholder or to any
other Person by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ,
judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled set aside
or vacated.

 

12.8Removal of Securityholders' Representative; Authority of Securityholders'
Representative. Indemnitors representing a majority of the Pro Rata Shares of
the Indemnitors shall have the right at any time to remove or replace the
then-acting Securityholders' Representative and to appoint a successor
Securityholders' Representative; provided, however, that neither such removal
of the then-acting Securityholders' Representative nor such appointment of a
successor Securityholders' Representative shall be effective until the
delivery to Parent of executed counterparts of a writing signed by such
majority in interest of the Indemnitors with respect to such removal and
appointment, together with an acknowledgement signed by the successor
Securityholders' Representative appointed in such writing that he, she or it
accepts the responsibility of successor Securityholders' Representative and
agrees to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to the Securityholders' Representative. Each

all of the power, authority, immunities, indemnities, rights and privileges
conferred by any SR Agreement upon the original Securityholders'
Representative, and the term "Securityholders' Representative" as used herein

Representative. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Securityholders' Representative or any
member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement and the other SR Agreements.

 

12.9Expenses of the Securityholders' Representative. The Securityholders'
Representative Expense Fund shall be used to reimburse the out of pocket fees

Representative and the powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Securityholders' Representative Group hereunder: (a) are

claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement
(including the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement) or the
Contemplated Transactions shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware (including in respect of the statute of
limitations or other limitations period applicable to any such claim,
controversy or dispute), without regard to its rules of conflict of laws,
except with respect to any matter set forth herein that would require the
application of the CCC to be validly determined thereunder, including

with respect to the Merger and the approval thereof by (and other corporate
matters relating to the internal affairs of) the Company, which shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the CCC. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
located in the State of Delaware (the "Chosen Courts") for any litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including the negotiation,
validity or performance of this Agreement) or the Contemplated Transactions
(and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such
courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in
the Chosen Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Chosen Court that
such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum.
Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not
otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint
and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such party's agent for
acceptance of legal process and (b) that service of process may also be made
on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service. Service made pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) above shall have the
same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the
State of Delaware. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, any and all disputes
relating to the matters set forth in Section 3.5 or Article X shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.5 or Article
X, respectively, if different procedures are set forth therein. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION
BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.

 

13.8Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any
time before or after any approval hereof by the shareholders of the Company
and Merger Sub; provided, however, that after the execution of the Shareholder
Written Consent, no amendment shall be made that by law requires further
approval by the Shareholders without obtaining such requisite approval under
the CCC; provided, further, that no amendment may be made to this Agreement
after the Closing without the prior written consent of the Securityholders'
Representative.

 

13.9Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company
(in the case of Parent or Merger Sub) or Parent (in the case of the Company),
and at any time after the Effective Time, the Securityholders' Representative
(in the case of Parent or the Surviving Corporation) or Parent (in the case of
the Securityholders' Representative), may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such
waiver or extension is to be enforced. Waiver of any term or condition of
this Agreement by a party shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or waiver of the same term or condition by such party, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of this Agreement by such party.

13.10No Agreement Until Executed. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding among the parties hereto unless and until this Agreement is
executed and delivered by the parties hereto.

 

13.11Conflicts and Privilege. It is acknowledged by each of the parties
hereto that each of the Securityholders' Representative and SupplyPike has
retained Goodwin Procter LLP ("Goodwin") to act as its counsel in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that
in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Securityholders' Representative or
any of the Securityholders or SupplyPike, on the other hand, Goodwin may
represent the Securityholders' Representative, Securityholders and/or
SupplyPike in such dispute even though the interests of the Securityholders'
Representative, Securityholders and/or SupplyPike may be directly adverse to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and even though Goodwin may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub further agree that, as to all
communications between or among Goodwin, on the one hand, and the Company, the
Securityholders' Representative, any Securityholder and/or SupplyPike, on the
other hand, that relate in any way to the Contemplated Transactions or a
similar transaction prior to the Closing, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Securityholders'
Representative and the Securityholders, or with respect to matters under the
SupplyPike Agreements, SupplyPike, and may be controlled by the
Securityholders' Representative and Securityholders, or with respect to
matters under the SupplyPike Agreements, SupplyPike, and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and a third party other than the Securityholders'
Representative, a Securityholder or SupplyPike, on the other hand, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such
third party; provided, however, that neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent
of the Securityholders' Representative, or with respect to matters under the
SupplyPike Agreements, SupplyPike.

 

13.12Mutual Drafting. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have been
represented by attorneys throughout the Contemplated Transactions who have
carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties do
not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

 

13.13Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
failure of any party hereto to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder,
including such party's failure to take all actions as are necessary on such
party's part in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement to
consummate the Merger, will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for
which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, subject to Section 10.7, each party hereto hereby consents to the
issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel
performance of such party's obligations and to the

 

93

 

AmericasActive:12666190.14 94

 



 

granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of such party's
obligations hereunder. Each party hereto accordingly agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under this
Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 13.13. Each party
hereto further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 13.13, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. If prior to the Termination Date, any party hereto brings an
action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party, the Termination Date shall automatically be
extended by such other time period established by the court presiding over
such action if the court orders such an extension.

 

13.14Entire Agreement; Binding Effect. This Agreement, together with the
Schedules (including the Disclosure Schedules) and Exhibits hereto, and the
other Transaction Documents and any other document executed by the parties
simultaneously herewith or pursuant thereto, constitutes the entire agreement
of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution of this Agreement
and any termination of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefits of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns and, except as expressly set forth herein, is not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, and
may be executed and transmitted by facsimile, pdf or other form of electronic
transmission in two (2) or more counterparts, which together shall constitute
a single agreement. Section 8.7 and Article X concerning indemnification are
intended to be for the benefit of the DandO Indemnified Parties and Parent
Indemnified Parties described therein and the covenants contained therein may
be enforced by such DandO Indemnified Parties and Parent Indemnified Parties,
respectively.
