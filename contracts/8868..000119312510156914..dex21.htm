B. In accordance with applicable Law, (i) the board of directors of the Seller
has deemed this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be expedient and in the best interests of the Seller, and (ii) the Seller
Stockholders have unanimously authorized this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

C. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Avon

the Buyer Parent (the " _Lenexa Buyer Sub_ "), Adaplis, L.L.C., a Kansas
limited liability company and an Affiliate of the Seller (" _Adaplis_ "), and

below) pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Lenexa Purchase
Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION

following meanings in this Agreement:

 

" _Actual Cash and Cash Equivalents Amount_ " has the meaning provided in
_Section 2.8(d)(iii)_. 

" _Actual Closing Schedule_ " has the meaning provided in _Section 2.8(d)_. " _Actual Indebtedness Amount_ " has the meaning provided in  _Section
2.8(d)(ii)_.

" _Actual Working Capital Amount_ " has the meaning provided in  _Section
2.8(d)(i_), which amount will be calculated in the manner described on the
Working Capital Schedule and in accordance with _Section 2.8_.

 

" _Adaplis_ " has the meaning provided in the Recitals.

 

" _Admin Escrow Amount_ " has the meaning provided in _Section 2.6(d)_.

 

" _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that
directly or indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled by or is
under common ownership or control with that Person. The term " _control_ "
(including with correlative meanings, the terms " _controlled by_ " and "
_under common control with_ "), as applied to any Person, means the
possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction
of the management and policies of the Person, whether through the ownership of
voting securities or other ownership interest, by contract or otherwise. Each
Seller Stockholder is (and/or shall be deemed) an Affiliate of the Seller and
each other Affiliate of the Seller until the Effective Time.

 

" _After-Tax Basis_ " means that, in determining the amount of the payment
necessary to indemnify any party against, or reimburse any party for, Losses,
the amount of such Losses shall be reduced by an amount equal to the net
amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Tax Indemnitee or by the
Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate of either) as a result of incurring such
Losses, which Tax Benefit would not have arisen but for such Losses. The net
amount of any Tax Benefit that results from incurring Losses shall be computed
by: (i) taking into account only the Tax Benefits that actually result from
the offset of such Losses against taxable income on the Tax Return for the
Taxable Period during which such Losses are sustained or paid; (ii) taking
into account the Tax effect on such Tax Return of any reduction in Tax basis
in assets that results from the operation of _Section 8.10(a)_ and (iii) if
the parties agree that an indemnification payment cannot be treated as a
purchase price adjustment pursuant to _Section 8.10(a)_, then taking into
account any Tax on any payments under _Section 8.1_, _Section 9.2_ or
_Section 9.3_. A Tax Benefit will be treated as having been "actually
realized" only if it actually reduces the Tax payable by the Tax Indemnitee or
of the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate of either) for the Taxable Period
during which Losses are sustained or paid, rather than just creating or
increasing a Tax loss carry-forward (or other Tax credit or benefit available
for use in the future).

LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as such, another "big four" accounting

American Arbitration Association shall select a firm of nationally recognized
independent public accountants that shall have no conflict of interest with
respect to either the Buyer Parent or the Seller to serve as the Appointed
Arbiter.

agreement between the Seller and the Buyer Sub substantially in the form

Chief Financial Officer (or officer of equivalent or similar position) of

all disputed items within the 20-day period set forth in _Section 2.9(f)_,
then the Buyer Parent and the Seller Representative will submit only those
items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Appointed Arbiter. The Buyer
Parent and the Seller Representative will, and will cause their respective
accountants to, cooperate fully with the Appointed Arbiter to facilitate its
resolution of the dispute, including by providing and explaining as requested
the information, data and work papers used by such Party to prepare the
Earnout Statement, the Earnout Statement Objection Notice and their
interpretation of the dispute. The Appointed Arbiter will determine and report
to the Buyer Parent and the Seller Representative its determination on the

qualified or licensed to do



 

30  business as a foreign corporation or organization and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

its Subsidiaries has all requisite right, power and authority to execute and
deliver each Company Agreement and to perform its obligations under each

the Seller and its Subsidiaries and the performance by the Seller and its
Subsidiaries of their obligations under each Company Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated under each Company Agreement
have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite action, and no other
action (corporate, shareholder or otherwise) is necessary to authorize the

Knowledge, there is no fact, error or admission relevant to any material
Permit that would permit the suspension, revocation, withdrawal, modification
or limitation of, or result in the threatened suspension, revocation,
withdrawal, modification or limitation of, or in the loss of any material
Permit. No consent, approval or modification of any Governmental Authority is
required for any material Permit to be valid and in full force and effect

Time, use (i) the name "Silpada", (ii) any trademarks, service marks, trade
dress, trade names, Internet domain names or any registrations or applications
for any Trademarks included in the Owned Intellectual Property, or (iii) any
derivation or translation of any of the foregoing, or any Trademark
confusingly similar thereto.

 

(b) The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer may, at any time after
the date of this Agreement, amend the corporate name of the Buyer Sub to a
name that includes the name "Silpada Designs." The Buyer agrees that (i) the
right to use the name "Silpada Designs" shall terminate upon the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article XI_ hereto and (ii) within
three (3) Business Days following any such termination, the Buyer Sub shall
change its corporate name to a name that does not include the name "Silpada"
in whole or in part and shall amend or terminate any certificate of assumed
name, fictitious name, d/b/a/ filings or other filings containing the name
"Silpada" so as to eliminate such name.

 

7.9. _Director and Officer Indemnification_. From and after the Closing Date
for a period of six (6) years, the Buyer will not, without the Seller
Representatives prior written consent, amend the provisions of the Buyer
Subs Organizational Documents in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Buyer Subs directors and officers to indemnification and
advancement of expenses with respect to claims brought against them in their
capacity as such.

7.10.  _Confidentiality_.

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing, at which time the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate. Until the termination of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Seller and each Seller Stockholder agree to
comply with the Sellers confidentiality obligations to the Buyer Parent under
the Confidentiality Agreement as if it were party thereto. If, for any reason,
the transactions 



 

60  contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, subject to applicable Law and to the extent
legally permissible, the Seller and the Seller Stockholders shall treat as
confidential and shall safeguard, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to treat as confidential and safeguard, any
and all information, knowledge and data regarding the Buyer, the Seller or
the Company Assets, in each case by using no less than a reasonable standard
of care to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure of such
information, knowledge and data.

 

(c) Each Party acknowledges that the confidentiality obligations set forth
herein shall not extend to information, knowledge and data that is publicly
available or becomes publicly available through no act or omission of the
Party owing a duty of confidentiality, or becomes available on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the Party owing a duty
of confidentiality so long as such source is not known by such Party to be
bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other obligations of secrecy to
the other Party.

 

7.11. _Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) The Buyer Sub shall offer employment to each Employee, effective upon the
Effective Time. All such offers of employment pursuant to this _Section
7.11(a)_ will be for employment-at-will and will be contingent on the Employee
satisfying customary hiring conditions, as applicable, and the Buyer Sub may
terminate any Employee at any time and for any reason following the Effective
Time.

(b) As of the Effective Time, the Buyer Sub shall, in accordance with their
terms, where applicable, adopt and assume all of the Benefit Plans, other
than the Seller 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, and all rights, responsibilities,
obligations, liabilities, insurance policies and service provider contracts
thereunder. On and after the Closing Date, neither the Seller nor any of the
Seller Stockholders shall have any rights, responsibilities, obligations or
liabilities under any such assumed Benefit Plan, regardless of whether such
rights, responsibilities, obligations or liabilities arose prior to, on or
after the Closing Date, except with respect to a breach of _Section 4.20_ of
this Agreement.

 

(c) The Buyer Sub shall assume the liability for accrued and unused vacation
with respect to each Employee as of the Effective Time.

(d) The Buyer shall permit Employees who have an account balance under the
Seller 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, a tax-qualified defined contribution
retirement plan, to rollover (whether by direct or indirect rollover, as
selected by such Employee) his or her "eligible rollover distribution" (as
defined under Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in the form of cash, a
promissory note (in the case of loans) or any combination thereof from the
Seller 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan to the Buyer Personal Savings Account Plan,
a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. In the case of
any Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Seller 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan, the Seller and the Buyer shall take (or cause to be taken) any
and all

 



 

61  necessary action, to the extent allowable by Law, to permit the Employee to
rollover such outstanding loan balance to the Buyer Personal Savings Account
Plan through a direct rollover on or as soon as administratively possible
after the Closing Date. Each Employee shall become a participant in the Buyer
Personal Savings Account Plan on the Closing Date and, for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under such plan, shall receive credit for the
Employees service with the Seller.

(e) After the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide to the Seller, without
charge, the services and support from the Sellers former Vice President of
Human Resources that are necessary for the Seller to terminate and liquidate
the Seller 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan. Such services and support shall
include (i) the preparation and filing of Form 5310 with the Internal Revenue
Service for the termination of such plan and responding to questions and
requests for information in connection with such filing, (ii) the
administration of the Seller 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan through the date of
final liquidation, and (iii) the preparation and filing of all Form 5500s,
including the final Form 5500 following liquidation of such plan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, such services and support will only
be provided in a settlor capacity or for purely administrative functions and
will not be provided in a fiduciary capacity.

 

(f) Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon
any individual (including any Employee) any right to employment or continued
employment with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any period by reason of
this Agreement. In addition, the provisions of this Agreement, in particular
this _Section 7.11_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this
Agreement, and no other Person (including any current or former employee,
director or independent contractor or any other individual associated
therewith) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of
the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
Benefit Plan or any compensation or benefit plan of the Buyer nor shall
anything contained herein restrict the Buyer or its Affiliates from amending
or terminating any of their employee benefit plans or compensation
arrangements.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TAX MATTERS

 

8.1. _Tax Indemnities_.

 

(a) The Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Parent and
the Buyer Sub and any parent, Subsidiary, associate, Affiliate, director,
officer, employee, shareholder or agent of any of such parties, and their
respective representatives, successors and assigns (in each case other than
the Seller, any Seller Stockholder or any beneficiary of any
Seller Stockholder that is a trust, solely in their capacity as such) (each,
a " _Tax Indemnitee_ ") from and against, and will reimburse each Tax
Indemnitee for, any and all Taxes (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses in connection with any action, suit or Proceeding relating to
liabilities for Taxes) arising out of or attributable to:



 

62 (i) any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or promise related to Taxes made by the Seller
or the Seller Stockholders contained in this Agreement;

 

(ii) any and all Taxes of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or for which
the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable for any Taxable Period
(including any Tax liability arising as a result of (A) a failure by the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to properly withhold or remit the Sellers
or any Seller Stockholders allocable share of any income or sales Tax, (B)
any Tax liability of any Seller Stockholder for which the Seller is liable
under any applicable Law, and (C) the failure of the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Seller Stockholder to comply with any withholding or
reporting obligations), or portion thereof, ending on or before the Effective
Time, except to the extent that such Taxes are specifically set forth in the
Tax Reserve (if any) accrued on the most recent Interim Financial Statements
or accrued as a current liability and taken into account in determining
Working Capital;

(iii) any and all Taxes allocated to the Seller pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)_, except to the extent that such Taxes are specifically set forth in
the Tax Reserve (if any) accrued on the most recent Interim Financial
Statements or accrued as a current liability and taken into account in
determining Working Capital; and

(iv) any and all Taxes imposed on or through the Seller Stockholders or their
beneficiaries.

(b) Except as provided in _Section 8.2_, the portion of any Tax payable with
respect to any Taxable Period that begins on or before, and ends after, the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ " and a " _Straddle Period Tax_ "),
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
will be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any actual or deemed sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable (after giving
effect to amounts that may be deducted from or offset against the Taxes) if
the Taxable Period ended on the Closing Date, and the Parties will elect to do
so if permitted by applicable Laws; and

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
Company Assets or the assets of any Affiliate of the Seller, or otherwise
measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 



 

63 (c) RESERVED.

 

(d) Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes (and
associated interest) for a Straddle Period will be attributed to the Buyer or
the Seller based upon the method employed in _Section 8.1(b)_ taking into
account the type of Tax to which the credit or refund relates. The Buyer will
pay or cause to be paid to the Seller Representative an amount equal to (i)
any Tax refund apportioned pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ to a Taxable Period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii) any Tax
credit or refund apportioned pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ to a period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent such
Tax credit or refund actually reduces the Tax liability of the Buyer for
periods (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, within 30 days
after receipt of such Tax refund or actual use of such Tax credit. The Buyer
will have no obligation to pay any amounts in respect of a refund or credit to
the extent such refund or credit is taken into account in determining the
Actual Working Capital Amount.

 

(e) The Seller will pay any amount payable under this _Section 8.1_ with
respect to an indemnity Claim by a Tax Indemnitee that can be satisfied by a
remittal of Tax to a Governmental Authority within 20 calendar days after
written notice by the Tax Indemnitee or the relevant Governmental Authority,
as the case may be; _provided_ , that the Tax Indemnitee will reimburse the
Seller for any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Tax Indemnitee from the
remittal of such Tax (or payment) within 10 days after the filing of the Tax
Return reporting such Tax Benefit. The Seller will pay any amount payable
under this _Section 8.1_ in all other cases within 20 calendar days after
written demand; _provided_ , that the Tax Indemnitee will reimburse the Seller
for any Tax Benefit actually realized from the remittal of such Tax (or
payment) within 10 days after the filing of the Tax Return reporting such Tax
Benefit.

(f) If a Tax Indemnitee makes any Claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_, the Tax Indemnitee will be entitled to collect the amount due
for indemnification (subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in
this Agreement) only in the following manner:

 

(i) the Buyer will collect such amount from the Escrow Account under the
Escrow Agreement, and the amounts therein will be reduced by any amount that
is owed by the Seller to any Tax Indemnitee or Indemnified Party at the time;
and

 

(ii) after the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account are reduced to zero,
the Seller will be liable for (and if the Seller no longer exists or does not
have sufficient funds to cover such Claim, the Seller Stockholders will each
be severally liable on a pro rata basis (i.e., in proportion to their
ownership of the Seller at the Effective Time) for) any balance owed to the
Tax Indemnitee with respect to such Claim.

The rights of any Tax Indemnitee under this _Section 8.1_ are the only
rights and remedies that such Tax Indemnitee has with respect to the
collection of indemnification Claims for Taxes under this Agreement.



 

64 8.2. _Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 

(a) The Seller will, and the Seller Stockholders will cause the Seller to,
prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed in a manner
consistent with past practice, all Tax Returns related to any Transferred
Subsidiary or any other Transferred Assets that are required to be filed by
the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries before the Closing Date (taking
into account any extensions); _except_ that the Seller will deliver any such
Tax Return to the Buyer at least 15 Business Days before its due date, and the
Buyer shall have the right to review and provide comments on such Tax Returns,
and the Seller shall act reasonably in deciding whether to accept or reject
such comments. If the Buyer does not provide comments within 10 Business Days
after receipt of the Tax Returns, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted
such Tax Returns without comment. The Seller will timely pay all Taxes shown
as due on such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and
complete in all material respects and shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with prior practice, unless otherwise required by applicable Laws. The Buyer
will control the preparation and filing of any amendment or other filing
related to any such Tax Return that is filed after the Closing Date, subject
to the Sellers rights and the procedures set forth in _Sections 8.2_ , _8.5_
and _8.6_.

(b) The Buyer will prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be
filed by any Transferred Subsidiary or with respect to any other Transferred
Assets for all Taxable Periods ending on, before or including the Closing Date
and with due dates (including by way of a properly filed extension) on or
after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Returns_ "). Such Post-Closing
Returns shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects and shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. The Buyer shall deliver any such Post-Closing
Returns to the Seller Representative at least 15 Business Days before its due
date, and the Seller Representative shall have the right to review and provide
comments on the post-Closing Returns, and the Buyer shall act reasonably in
deciding whether to accept or reject such comments. If the Seller does not
provide comments within 10 Business Days after receipt of the Post Closing
Returns, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Post Closing Returns
without comment. The Seller will pay the Buyer the amount of Taxes shown as
being due on a Tax Return that are attributable to any Taxable Period (or
portion thereof) ending before the Closing Date at least five (5) Business
Days before the due date of any payment required to be made with respect to
any Post-Closing Return, unless such cost is already borne by the Seller
pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

 

8.3. _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Seller Representative
and the Seller will: (i) after the Closing (x) reasonably assist and cause
the Seller to assist the Buyer in preparing and filing any Tax Returns that
the Buyer is responsible for preparing and filing with respect to the
Transferred Assets, and (y) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits
by, or disputes or other Proceedings with, any Taxing Authority or with
respect to any matters relating to Taxes of or affecting the Seller; and (ii)
make available to the Buyer and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested by the Buyer all information, records and documents relating to Tax
matters (including Tax Returns) of or relating to the Transferred Assets
relating to any Taxable Period that begins on or before the Closing Date that
remain in the Sellers control. The Buyer will keep any information obtained
under this _Section 8.3_ confidential, except (x) as may be necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or Claims for refund

 



 

65  or the conduct of any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to
Taxes, (y) with the consent of the Seller Representative, and (z) that the
Seller Representative will have the right to review such information.

8.4. _Conveyance Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and other
such Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer or gains Taxes and
stock transfer Taxes), all penalties, interest and additions to Tax, and any
and all fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be paid 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the
Seller. Each Party to this Agreement will cooperate in the timely making of
all filings, returns, reports and forms required in connection with this
Agreement.

8.5. _Contests_.

 

(a) The Buyer will notify the Seller Representative in writing of the proposed
assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial
Proceeding or of any demand or Claim on the Buyer and its Affiliates or the
Seller that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer after the lapse of time,
could be grounds for indemnification by the Seller under _Section 8.1_ ,
_provided_ that the failure to provide notice will not affect any rights under
this Agreement, except to the extent the failure prejudices the Indemnifying
Party. The Buyers notice will contain factual information (to the
extent known to the Buyer and its Affiliates) briefly describing the asserted
Tax liability and will include copies of any notice or other document received
from any Taxing Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

 

(b) The Seller Representative will have the sole right, at its expense, to
control the conduct of, a Tax audit or administrative or judicial Proceeding
(a " _Contest_ ") that relates to Taxable Periods ending before the Closing
Date; _provided_ that, if any such Proceeding would result in an adjustment to
Tax that would have an adverse effect on the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
for a period ending after the Closing Date, the Seller Representative (i) will
permit the Buyer to participate in the Proceeding, and (ii) will not settle or
otherwise compromise the Proceeding without the Buyers prior written
consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) The Seller Representative may elect to participate, at its expense, in
any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability for Straddle Period Taxes
with respect to which indemnity may be sought from the Seller pursuant to
_Section 8.1_.

 

(d) The Buyer will not take any position or agree to any settlement in a
Contest that would result in liability of the Seller or an indemnity Claim by
the Buyer or the Buyer Sub against the Seller without the Seller
Representatives prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, except as follows:

 

(i) the Buyer will notify the Seller Representative in writing (when
practical) of the Buyers intent to take any such position in a Contest, and
include with the notice a description of the Buyers position and its
rationale for doing so;



 

66 (ii) if within 10 days after the Buyer gives its notice, the
Seller Representative gives the Buyer written notice objecting to its
position, then the Parties will meet, together with their respective
attorney(s) and/or accountant(s), as promptly as feasible, and attempt to
agree on a position and/or strategy for the Buyer to take in the matter;

(iii) if the Parties are unable to agree on a position and/or strategy, then
either Party may refer the matter to the Appointed Arbiter to review their
respective positions and to provide their arguments in support of the
positions;

 

(iv) if the Appointed Arbiter determines that there is substantial authority
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6662-4(d)(2) for the
position asserted by the Seller Representative, then the Buyer will proceed
with such position in the Contest;

 

(v) alternatively, if the Appointed Arbiter determines that there is no
substantial authority for the position asserted by the Seller Representative,
then the Buyer may proceed with the Contest taking the position the Appointed
Arbiter recommends as being feasible, with a substantial authority basis that
is favorable to the Buyer;

 

(vi) the Buyer will, upon the Seller Representatives request, appeal a
determination in a Contest (at the Seller Representatives sole cost and
expense, which the Seller Representative will pay directly and not from the
Escrow Amount); _provided_ , the Buyer need only assert positions that the
Appointed Arbiter determines have substantial authority within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6662-4(d)(2); and

(vii) the Buyer will pay one-half of the fees, costs and expenses of the
Appointed Arbiter and the Seller Representative will pay the other one-half,
except as provided in _Section 8.5(d)(vi)_.

 

8.6. _Audits for Pre-Closing Taxable Periods_. Except as provided in _Section
8.5(b)_ , after the Closing, the Buyer will control any subsequent Tax
Proceeding, or any future audit or Proceedings for any Taxable Period
(including any Taxable Period ending before the Closing Date), but the Seller
Representative may participate at its own expense in any such audit
or Proceeding for any Taxable Period ending before the Closing Date. Neither
the Buyer nor the Buyer Sub will take any position or agree to any settlement
in an audit that will result in liability to the Seller or an indemnity claim
against the Seller by the Buyer or the Buyer Sub without the consent of the
Seller Representative, which may not be unreasonably withheld. If the Parties
disagree on an audit position or settlement, then the position that the Buyer
Sub will take in the Contest will be determined in accordance with the
procedure set forth in _Section 8.5(d)_.

8.7. _Tax Covenants_. All Contracts under which any Transferred Subsidiary
may at any time have an obligation to indemnify for or share the payment of or
liability for any portion of a Tax (or any amount calculated with reference to
any portion of a Tax) will be terminated 



 

67  with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries, and the Transferred
Subsidiaries will be released from any liability under such Contracts.

 

8.8. _RESERVED_.

 

8.9. _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The Seller and the Buyer agree to allocate the Purchase Price in
accordance with the fair market value of the Transferred Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Purchase Price will be allocated among
the Transferred Assets in accordance with _Exhibit D_.

 

(b) The Parties agree to (i) prepare and timely file (or cause there to be
prepared and timely filed) all applicable Tax Returns, including Form 8594
(and all supplements thereto), in a manner consistent with the allocation of
the Purchase Price as finalized and (ii) act in accordance with the allocation
of the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Tax Laws, and no Party (nor any of their
Affiliates) shall take or concede to a position with a Taxing Authority, that
is inconsistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price unless otherwise
required by applicable Tax Laws;  _provided_ that if a Party proposes a
settlement or other final disposition of a contest with a Taxing Authority
inconsistent, in whole or in part, with such allocation, such Party may
proceed with such settlement or other disposition unless the other Party
requests that such Party (x) contest the matter further and (y) agrees to bear
the cost and expense of such further contest. The Seller Representative and
the Buyer hereby agree to revise the allocation of the Purchase Price
to reflect any adjustment made to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
2.8_ hereto.

8.10. _Miscellaneous_. 

(a) For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat any indemnification payment
under this Agreement, including under this _Article VIII_ and _Article IX_ ,
as adjustments to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by Law and
subject to _Section 2.10_.

 

(b) Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, this _Article
VIII_ will be the sole provision governing indemnities for Taxes under this
Agreement.

(c) For purposes of this _Article VIII_ , all references to any Party or any
Affiliates of any Party include successors.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all
representations and warranties relating to Taxes contained in this Agreement
will survive until 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date and any Claim notice for monetary damages for a breach of any
such representations or warranties shall be barred unless it has been
provided by such date, but the Parties may seek specific enforcement of any
covenant or obligation relating to Taxes in accordance with _Section 12.10_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the covenants and agreements of the
Parties contained in this _Article VIII_ (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the covenants set forth in _Section 8.1(a)(ii)-(iv)_ of this Agreement)
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the date
that is 12



 

68  months after the date they are fully performed in accordance with their
terms or are otherwise terminated, whether by their terms or as a matter of
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, if no date for full performance
is specified (for example, covenants and agreements in _Section 8.1_ ), such
covenants and agreements shall survive in perpetuity. Notwithstanding anything
in the foregoing, with respect to any Claim under _Section 8.1_ , the
obligations of the Seller Stockholders under _Section 8.1(f)_ will survive
until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation for such Claim.

 

ARTICLE IX

(contained in _Article VI_ ) will survive the Closing and remain in full force
and effect until 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date.

(b) The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement
will survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the date

performance is specified (for example, covenants and agreements in this
_Article IX_ ), such covenants and agreements shall survive in perpetuity.

 

(c) Neither the Closing nor the Buyer Parents waiver of any condition to the
Closing constitutes a waiver of any of the rights to indemnification the
Buyer has under this Agreement, _except_ that if the Buyer Parent agrees in
writing to waive any of its rights to indemnification under _Article VIII_ or
this _Article IX_ , the Buyer Parent will be deemed to have waived its right
to indemnification as set forth in such written waiver. Each Indemnified Party
and Tax Indemnitee will be deemed to have waived its right to indemnification
to the same extent any such right is waived by the Buyer Parent pursuant this
_Section 9.1(c)_.

(d) Neither the Closing nor the Seller Representatives waiver of
any condition to the Closing constitutes a waiver of any of the rights to
indemnification the Seller has under this Agreement, _except_ that if the
Sellers Representative agrees in writing to waive any of the Sellers or the
Seller Stockholders rights to indemnification under this _Article IX_ , the
Seller and the Seller Stockholders will be deemed to have waived their rights
to indemnification as set forth in such written waiver. Each Indemnified Party
will be deemed to have waived its right to indemnification to the same extent
any such right is waived by the Seller Representative pursuant this _Section
9.1(d)_.

reimburse such party in respect of, all losses, liabilities, demands, claims,

result of, in connection with, or relating to or by virtue of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Seller or any Seller Stockholders under this Agreement or in any certificate

rights to which they may be entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the Seller
has no responsibility or liability respecting the Lenexa Purchase Agreement.

70  referred to individually as a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against and pay
on behalf of or reimburse such party in respect of, all Losses that any
Seller Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result
of, in connection with, or relating to or by virtue of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer under this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement;

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of
the Buyer under this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) any Assumed Liability; and

(d) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by the Buyer or any
of its respective Affiliates to any agent, broker, investment banker or other
firm or Person retained or employed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the
Seller Indemnified Parties are intended third party beneficiaries under this
Agreement and will be entitled to directly enforce any indemnification rights
to which they may be entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the Buyer has no
responsibility or liability respecting the Lenexa Purchase Agreement.

 

9.4. _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified Party (as
applicable, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") will promptly give the Party or
Parties obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of any Claim (including any
pending or threatened Claim by a third party that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement) to indemnification under this _Article
IX_. The failure to provide notice will not affect any rights under this
Agreement, except to the extent the failure actually prejudices the
Indemnifying Party. Any notices and communications to the Seller under this
_Article IX_ will be given to or made with the Seller Representative. The
Parties agree that (i) in this _Article IX_ they intend to shorten the
applicable statute of limitations period with respect to certain Claims; (ii)
notices for Claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any
applicable survival period specified in _Section 9.1_ for such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement; _provided_ , that if, prior to such
applicable date, an Indemnified Party shall have notified the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with this _Section 9.4_ of a Claim for indemnification
under this _Article IX_ (whether or not formal legal action shall have been
commenced based upon such claim), such Claim shall continue to be subject to
indemnification in accordance with this _Article IX_ notwithstanding the
passing of such applicable date.

 

(b) If the indemnity Claim involves a Claim by a third party against any
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may,
within 10 Business



 

71  Days after receipt of notice and upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party, assume on behalf of the Indemnified Party, through counsel of its
choosing and at its expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party
Claim so long as:

(i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within
the 10 Business Day period that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused
by the Third Party Claim,

(ii) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek
an injunction or other equitable relief,

(iii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
will have the financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and
fulfill the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations under this
Agreement, 

(iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party
Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to
establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the continuing business
interests of the Indemnified Party or the Buyer, and

 

(v) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently;

 

 _except_ that the Indemnified Party may participate in the settlement or
defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel chosen by it at its expense;
and _except_ that, if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that
representation by the Indemnifying Partys counsel of the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party may present such counsel with a conflict of
interests, then the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party will reasonably cooperate with each other in connection
with the Third Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified Party
may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such Third Party Claim
prior to the time that it receives a notice from the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with _Section 9.4(b)(i)_ assuming the settlement or defense of the
Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
9.4_ , the Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any action or consent to the
entry of any judgment in respect of any Third Party Claim, other than a solely
monetary settlement including (i) full payment by the Indemnifying Party, (ii)
a full release of the Indemnified Party and (iii) no finding or admission
of any wrongdoing or violation of Law. If the Indemnifying Party is not
contesting the Third Party Claim in good faith, then the Indemnified Party may
conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim,
and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate with the Indemnified Party and its
counsel in connection with such settlement or

 



 

72  defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may not
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
Claim which it is seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying Party or
admit to any liability with respect to such Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. The failure of the Indemnified Party to
participate in, conduct or control the defense will not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any obligation they may have under this Agreement
or otherwise under the Laws.

(c) The Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Parties will reasonably cooperate
with each other to implement the provisions of this _Section 9.4_.

 

9.5. _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. In connection with any indemnity
Claim, the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
_Article VIII_ or this _Article IX_ in connection with such indemnity Claim
will be (a) calculated on an After-Tax Basis, with the Indemnified Party
reimbursing the Indemnifying Party for any Tax Benefit actually realized from
the payment of the indemnity Claim within 10 days after the filing of the Tax
Return reporting such Tax Benefit, and (b) (i) reduced by the amount of any
insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party in connection
with such indemnity Claim or such Losses and (ii) increased by the amount of
any costs of collection in connection with such indemnity Claim or such
Losses; _provided_ that if the Indemnified Party actually receives any
insurance proceeds in connection with such indemnity Claim or such Losses
after the Indemnifying Parties indemnifies the Indemnified Party for such
Losses, the Indemnified Party will remit to the Indemnifying Party any such
insurance proceeds actually received, but only up to the amount of
indemnification proceeds actually received from the Indemnifying Party.

9.6. _Tax Matters_. The rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to
indemnification for any Tax matters (except as specifically provided elsewhere
in this _Article IX_ or in this Agreement) will be governed solely by _Article
VIII_. 

9.7. _Relation of Indemnity to Indemnity Escrow Amount_. Other than with
respect to Taxes (which are governed by  _Article VIII_ ):

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the
Seller under _Article IX_ , the Buyer will collect the amount due for
indemnification (subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in this
Agreement) solely from the funds then held in the Indemnity Escrow Account
under the Escrow Agreement, except in the case of a breach of _Section 2.8_ ,
for which any other recourse is expressly permitted.

(b) From and after the Closing, the right to indemnification of the
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article IX_ will be (i) the sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach of any representation or warranty of an
Indemnifying Party, and (ii) the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any
breach of any covenant or agreement of an Indemnifying Party (it being
understood that the Parties have the right to seek equitable relief, including
specific performance), in either case (i) or (ii), whether a contract claim,
a tort claim, a statutory claim or otherwise (other than with respect to any
Losses arising out of fraud or criminal misconduct or bad faith), (A) under
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule, (B) in any certificate or other 



 

73  document delivered by or on behalf of any Party under this Agreement or (C)
otherwise arising from or in connection with the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement.

 

9.8. _Indemnification Amounts; Limitations_. Except with respect to an
indemnification Claim under _Article VIII_ , notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

(a) the Seller will not be liable for any indemnification Claim pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_ (other than with regard to a breach of any Fundamental
Representations or Extended Representations made by the Seller or the Seller
Stockholders) unless and until the Dollar amount of all indemnifiable
Losses under this Agreement in the aggregate exceeds $6,270,000, in which
case the Seller will be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party for the
total amount of all indemnifiable Losses. For the avoidance of doubt, any
indemnifiable Losses in connection with a breach of any Fundamental
Representation or Extended Representation shall be subject to indemnification
under _Section 9.2(a)_ without regard to the foregoing threshold.

 

(b) in no event will the aggregate indemnification obligations of the Seller
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount, except that an
Indemnified Partys right to seek indemnification under this Agreement for any
Losses arising out of fraud or criminal misconduct or bad faith will not be
subject to or limited by the limits contained in this  _Section 9.8_.

(c) the Seller will not be liable for any Losses that have been expressly
included in the calculation of the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount pursuant to _Section 2.8_.

(d) the Seller will not be liable for any incidental, consequential or
punitive damages from a breach of the representations and warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement unless (i) the Seller or any Seller
Stockholder (or in the case of a Seller Stockholder that is a trust, the
trustee and/or any beneficiary of such trust) had actual knowledge of the
breach and did not disclose it on the _Disclosure Schedule_ or (ii) such
damages are awarded in connection with a Third Party Claim.

 

(e) The Indemnified Parties and Tax Indemnitees are required to take
commercially reasonable action to mitigate their Losses.

(a) The Seller Representative is not entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of his service under this Agreement;

incur no, responsibility whatsoever to the Seller or Adaplis by reason of
any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted under
this Agreement or in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements

judgment, act or omission constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct,
(ii) the Seller Representative will be entitled to rely on the advice of
counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the
matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the
Seller Representative pursuant to such advice will in no event subject the
Seller Representative to liability to the Seller or Adaplis unless by the
Seller Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct, and (iii) the
Seller Representative will be entitled to indemnification from and be held
harmless by the Seller or Adaplis, as applicable, against any loss, expense
(including reasonable attorneys fees) or other liability arising out of his

Agreement, other than for harm directly caused by the Seller Representatives
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Except as set forth in the
previous sentence and except with respect to the Seller Representatives
intentional failure to perform any affirmative contractual duty of the Seller
Representative under this Agreement or the Lenexa Purchase Agreement, 



 

78  notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Seller Representative, in his role as Seller Representative, will have no
direct liability whatsoever to the Buyer, any Tax Indemnitee or any Buyer
Indemnified Party. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 10.2_

any Buyer Indemnified Party under _Article VIII_  or _Article IX_ of this
Agreement or _Article VIII_ of the Lenexa Purchase Agreement.

ARTICLE XI

 

TERMINATION

 

11.1. _Termination Events_. This Agreement may, by notice given prior to or at
the Closing, be terminated:

 

(a) by either the Buyer Parent or the Seller if (i) the Closing has not
occurred (other than through the failure of any Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to comply in all material respects with its obligations under
this Agreement) on or before the date that is 75 days after the date of this
Agreement, or such later date as the Parties may agree upon (the " _Outside
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the sole reason that the Closing
has not occurred is that the condition set forth on _Section 3.5(a)_ has not
been fulfilled on or prior to the date that is 75 days after the date of this
Agreement, such date shall automatically be extended to the date that is 90
days after the date of this Agreement, which date shall be the "Outside Date"
for all purposes of this _Article XI_ , or (ii) any condition set forth in
_Section 3.5_ is incapable of being satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

 

(b) by the Buyer Parent (but only so long as the Buyer is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller or
the Seller Stockholders such that one or more of the conditions to Closing set
forth in _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.5_ are not capable of being fulfilled
as of the Outside Date;

(c) by the Seller Representative (but only so long as the Seller and the
Seller Stockholders are not in material breach of their respective obligations
under this Agreement) if there has been a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Buyer such that one or
more of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 3.4_ and _Section
3.5_ are not capable of being fulfilled as of the Outside Date; or

 

(d) by mutual consent of the Buyer Parent and the Seller.

 



 

79 11.2. _Effect of Termination_. Each Partys right of termination under 
_Section 11.1_ is in addition to any other rights it may have under this
Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be
an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to 
_Section 11.1_, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement
will terminate, except that the rights and obligations in this _Section 11.2_
and _Article XII_ will survive any termination. In addition, if
this Agreement is terminated by a Party because one or more of the conditions
to the terminating Partys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied
as a result of the other Partys failure to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement, the terminating Partys right to pursue all legal remedies
will survive such termination unimpaired.

the Buyer) are third party beneficiaries of _Article IX_.

 

12.4. _Extension; Waiver_. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller
Representative, on behalf of the Seller and each Seller Stockholder, on the
other hand, may, by written notice to the other: (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the others obligations under this Agreement, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the others representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any of its conditions or the
covenants owed to it contained in this Agreement, or (d) waive or modify
performance of any of the others obligations under this Agreement. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no action taken under this
Agreement will be deemed to constitute a waiver of compliance with any
representation, warranty, condition or covenant contained in this Agreement
and will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach,
whether of a similar or dissimilar nature.

12.5.  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and any
schedules and exhibits to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(including the _Disclosure Schedules_ ) supersede any other agreement, whether
written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by any Party
relating to the matters contemplated under this Agreement and constitute the
entire agreement by and among the Parties, subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

12.6. _Amendments, Supplements, Etc_.This Agreement may be amended or
supplemented at any time by additional written agreements as may mutually be
determined by the Buyer and the Seller Representative to be necessary,
desirable or expedient to further the purposes of this Agreement or to clarify
the intention of the Parties.

 

12.7. _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement will be governed
by and construed under Delaware law, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdiction other than Delaware.

12.8. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The Buyer Parent, the Buyer Sub, each
Seller Stockholder, the Seller and the Seller Representative in his capacity
as such irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware court sitting in
Wilmington, Delaware for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of or based on this Agreement or the subject matter of this
Agreement.



 

82  Each Party, to the extent applicable law permits, waives, and will not
assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any suit, action or
proceeding brought in the above-named courts, any Claim that: (a) it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of those courts, (b) the suit, action
or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, (c) the venue of the suit,
action or proceeding is improper, or (d) the Agreement or its subject matter
may not be enforced in or by these courts.

12.9. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising
out of or relating to the Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 

12.10. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the rights and remedies
of the Parties hereto are cumulative. The transactions contemplated under
this Agreement are unique transactions and any failure on the part of any
Party to complete the transactions contemplated under this Agreement on the
terms of this Agreement will not be fully compensable in damages and the
breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause
the other Parties irreparable harm.

 

(b) In the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Seller
Representative, any Seller Stockholder or the Seller, on the one hand, or the
Buyer, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations
set forth in this Agreement, the Seller Representative, each Seller
Stockholder and the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand
(as applicable), are entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 12.10_ shall survive the
Closing and shall be available with respect to any breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement with respect to covenants and obligations required
to be performed under this Agreement.

 

12.11. _Prevailing Party_. If any litigation or other court action,
arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding is commenced by any party to
enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other party, all fees,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs,
incurred by the prevailing party in such litigation, action, arbitration
or proceeding will be reimbursed by the losing party. If a party to such
litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding prevails in part, and loses in
part, the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such
litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding will award a reimbursement of
the fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party on an equitable basis.

 

12.12. _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute only one agreement. The signatures of the Parties
need not appear on the same counterpart, and delivery of an executed
counterpart signature page by facsimile or portable document format (.pdf)
is as effective as executing and delivering this Agreement in the presence of
the other Parties. This Agreement is effective upon delivery to (a) the Buyer
of an executed counterpart

 



 

83  from the Seller, the Seller Stockholders and the Seller Representative _and_
(b) the Seller of an executed counterpart from the Buyer Parent and the Buyer
Sub.

 

12.13. _Conflict Waiver_. Each Party waives (and will cause its Affiliates to
waive) any conflicts that may arise in connection with, and will not
challenge (and will cause its Affiliates not to challenge), claims of
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, or similar privilege or
immunity with respect to: (a) the representation by Lathrop and Gage LLP of the
Seller prior to or on the Closing Date in connection with any matter arising
under, or relating to, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (b) the representation by Lathrop and Gage LLP of the
Seller Stockholders and the Seller Representative prior to, on or following
the Closing Date in connection with any matter arising under, or relating to,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
in connection with any dispute between the Buyer with the Seller, any Seller
Stockholder, the Seller Representative or any of their Affiliates following
the Closing Date).

 

12.14. _Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Laws, (a) the
provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and
enforced as if the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part of this Agreement, (c) the remaining provisions of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this
Agreement, and (d) in lieu of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

 

12.15. _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. The initial press release
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be a joint
press release and thereafter the Seller will consult with the Buyer, and the
Buyer will consult with the Seller, prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _except_ as may be required by
applicable Law, including any legal requirement or rules of any national
securities exchange to which the Buyer is subject ( _provided_ that, to the
extent legally permitted, the Buyer will give the Seller a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon any such releases or announcements).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer will be permitted to make any
required filings with any Governmental Authority (including any national
securities exchange) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, _provided_ that, to the extent legally permitted, the Buyer will
give the Seller a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any such
filings.

12.16. _Bulk Sales_. Each Party agrees to waive compliance with Article 6 of
the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in each of the jurisdictions in which
any of the Transferred Assets are located to the extent that such Article 6 is
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

12.17. _Post-Closing Cooperation_.



 

84 (a) At any time or from time to time after the Closing, at the Buyers
request and without further consideration, the Seller shall execute and
deliver to the Buyer such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions as the Buyer may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in
order to transfer, convey and assign to the Buyer Sub, and to confirm the
Buyer Subs title to, all of the Transferred Assets, and, to the full extent
permitted by Law, to put the Buyer Sub in actual possession and operating
control of the Transferred Assets and to assist the Buyer in exercising all
rights with respect thereto.

 

(b) Upon the occurrence of the Closing and effective as of the Effective Time,
the Seller hereby constitutes and appoints the Buyer Sub the true and lawful
attorney of the Seller, with full power of substitution, in the name of the
Seller or the Buyer Sub, but on behalf of and for the benefit of the Buyer:
(i) to demand and receive from time to time any and all of the Transferred
Assets and to make endorsements and give receipts and releases for and in
respect of the same and any part thereof; (ii) to institute, prosecute,
compromise and settle any and all proceedings that the Buyer may deem proper
in order to collect, assert or enforce any claim, right or title of any kind
in or to the Transferred Assets; and (iii) to do all such acts and things in
relation to the matters set forth in the preceding clauses (i) through (ii) as
the Buyer shall deem desirable. The Seller hereby acknowledges that the
appointment hereby made and the powers hereby granted are coupled with an
interest and are not and shall not be revocable by it in any manner or for any
reason.

 

(c) Following the Closing, and subject to applicable Law, privileges
(including the attorney-client privilege) and contractual confidentiality
obligations, the Buyer Sub will afford the Seller and the Seller Stockholders
and their respective counsel and accountants, and the Seller and the Seller
Stockholders and their respective counsel and accountants will afford the
Buyer Sub, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
reasonable access to the books, records and other data relating to the
business formerly conducted by the Seller in its possession with respect to
periods prior to the Closing and the right to make copies and extracts
therefrom and to access a reasonable amount of the time and attention of
individual employees of the Buyer Sub after the Closing (so long as such
access does not unreasonably interfere with performance of their duties for
the Buyer) with respect to subject matters they are familiar with, to the
extent that such access may be reasonably required by the requesting Party in
connection with (i) the preparation of Tax Returns, (ii) the determination or
enforcement of rights and obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, (iii) compliance with the requirements of any Governmental
Authority, or (iv) in connection with any actual or threatened proceeding.
Further, the Buyer Sub agrees for a period extending six (6) years after the
Closing Date not to destroy or otherwise dispose of any books, records and
other data included in the Transferred Assets unless the Buyer Sub shall first
offer in writing to surrender such books, records and other data to the
Seller and the Seller Stockholders and such other Parties shall not agree in
writing to take possession thereof during the ten (10) Business Day period
after such offer is made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this paragraph, if the Parties are in an adversarial relationship in
litigation or arbitration, the furnishing of information, documents or records
in accordance with this paragraph shall be subject to applicable rules
relating to discovery.
