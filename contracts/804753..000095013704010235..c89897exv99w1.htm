Balance Sheet; (ii)&nbsp;on the basis that a Disputed Item does not reflect, or has
not been made in a manner consistent with, the provisions of this Agreement;

Item exceeds $25,000 and all such allowable Disputed Items exceed $100,000 in

VitalWorks in writing of each Disputed Item, and specify the amount thereof in
dispute and the specific basis therefor, within 60&nbsp;days after receipt of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and Working Capital Statement. The failure by
Purchaser to provide a notice of Disputed Items to VitalWorks within such
60-day period will constitute Purchaser&#146;s acceptance of all the items in the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and Working Capital Statement. Any item in the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and Working Capital Statement which is not a
Disputed Item shall constitute Purchaser&#146;s acceptance of such items after the

during such Resolution Period the parties are unable to reach agreement,
VitalWorks and Purchaser shall refer all unresolved Disputed Items to Deloitte
&#038; Touche LLP, or any other independent accounting firm as VitalWorks and
Purchaser shall mutually agree upon (the &#147;<U>Independent Accountant</U>&#148;). To
the extent practical, the Independent Accountant shall make a determination
with respect to each unresolved Disputed Item within 15 Business Days after its
engagement by VitalWorks and Purchaser to resolve such Disputed Items, which
determination shall be made in accordance with the rules set forth in this
<U>Section&nbsp;2.7</U>. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to VitalWorks and
Purchaser, within such 15-Business-Day period, a report setting forth its
adjustments, if any, to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and/or the Working
Capital Statement and the calculations supporting such adjustments. Such
report shall be final, binding on the parties and conclusive. VitalWorks and
Purchaser shall each pay one-half of all the costs incurred in connection with
the engagement of the Independent Accountant. As used herein, &#147;<U>Final
Working Capital</U>&#148; shall mean (i)&nbsp;if no notice of Disputed Items is delivered
by Purchaser within the period provided in <U>subclause (b)</U> above, Working
Capital of the Business as shown in the Working Capital Statement as prepared
by VitalWorks; or (ii)&nbsp;if such a notice of Disputed Items is delivered by
Purchaser, either (x)&nbsp;Working Capital of the Business as agreed to in writing
by VitalWorks and Purchaser; or (y)&nbsp;Working Capital of the Business as adjusted
by the Independent Accountant&#146;s calculation delivered pursuant to this
<U>subclause (c)</U>.

Capital, pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with written instructions given to VitalWorks by Purchaser, the
amount of such shortfall, together with interest on such amount from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment at the Applicable Rate. If the Final
Working Capital is greater than $(2,278,739), then Purchaser shall, within 10

by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with written

known or reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of
such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or certificate
delivered pursuant hereto in respect of which such Loss shall have occurred.
If any action at Law or suit in equity is instituted by or against a third

Liability as a Loss under this <U>Article&nbsp;IX</U>, the Indemnified Party shall

provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party;

for the Participating Party. The Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any
