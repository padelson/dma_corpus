 (b) For not less than six months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain, or shall cause its Affiliates to maintain, compensation and Benefit Plans for Affected Employees who accept employment with Purchaser or an affiliate of Purchaser (each, a " _Hired Employee_ ") that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable on balance than as provided under the compensation arrangements and Benefit Plans as in effect on the date hereof as set forth on  _Schedules 5.15_ and _5.16_ ; provided, that nothing in this Section 7.4 shall be deemed to change the status of the Hired Employees as "at-will" employees.    ##### Table of Contents

  

  

 (c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, honor all vacation days earned by Hired Employees as of the Closing Date. All such vacation days have been awarded in accordance with VitalWorks policies, attached hereto as  _Schedule 7.4(c)_.

 Section 7.7 _Noncompetition_. (a) Subject to the provisions of this  _Section 7.7_, VitalWorks agrees that for a period of five years from the Closing Date (the " _Non Compete_      ##### Table of Contents

 

  

 _Period_ "), VitalWorks shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, compete in any material respect with the Business as conducted as of the
Closing Date (" _Competitive Activity_ ") or directly or indirectly own any
interest in any party that is engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be deemed to be a violation of
this subsection for VitalWorks or any of its Subsidiaries; (i) to invest in
or own any non-voting debt securities or other non-voting debt obligations;
(ii) to invest in any third Person (including any corporation or mutual or
other fund) which invests in, manages or operates a Competitive Activity, so
long as VitalWorks or any of its Subsidiarys investment is less than 10% of
the outstanding ownership interest in such third Person and VitalWorks and
its Subsidiaries do not control or conduct such third Person or Competitive
Activity; (iii) to invest in, own an interest in, or acquire all or a
majority of the stock or assets of any Person which is not engaged primarily
in a Competitive Activity; (iv) to invest in securities having less than 5%
of the outstanding voting power of any Person, the securities of which are
publicly traded or listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation
system; or (v) to own any equity interests through any employee benefit plan
or pension plan. For purposes of this _Section 7.7_ , "engaged primarily in a
Competitive Activity" shall mean that greater than 20% of the aggregate net
revenue derived during the last complete fiscal year of such Person
(calculated on a consolidated basis) is derived from the Competitive
Activity. Each investment or acquisition made by VitalWorks or
its Subsidiaries which is subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.7_
must be permissible hereunder at the time of such investment; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any such investment which was permissible when made
cannot thereafter be the basis of a claim of violation of this _Section
7.7_.   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of (i) any merger, combination, consolidation or similar business transaction involving VitalWorks in which the holders of VitalWorks stock immediately prior to such closing are not the holders, directly or indirectly, of a majority of the voting securities of the surviving or continuing Person in such transaction, (ii) the sale or transfer by VitalWorks of all or substantially all of its assets to an acquiring Person in which the holders of VitalWorks stock immediately prior to such closing are not the holders of a majority of the voting securities of the acquiring Person, or (iii) the sale by the holders of VitalWorks stock of an amount of VitalWorks stock that equals or exceeds a majority of the shares of VitalWorks stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such closing to a Person in which the holders of the VitalWorks stock immediately prior to such closing are not the holders of a majority of the voting securities of such Person, where at the time of such transaction the surviving or continuing Person, as the case may be, is engaged in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, in Competitive Activity (such surviving or continuing Person, an " _Acquirer_ ") _Section 7.7(a)_ shall not apply to such Acquirer and such Acquirer shall not be bound by the terms and restrictions of _Section 7.7(a)_.   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, VitalWorks shall be permitted to engage in Competitive Activity during the Non Compete Period, provided such Competitive Activity does not involve the sale of EDIS (Emergency Department Information System) software or anesthesiology practice management software, and such Competitive Activity includes the license of PACS Software (defined below); _provided_ , _however_ , that the sale of EMR (Emergency Medical Records) software by VitalWorks shall be prohibited for the eighteen month period immediately following the Closing. PACS Software shall mean software that allows the user to manage, store, retrieve and manipulate medical images.    ##### Table of Contents

  

  

 (d) For a period of five years after the Closing Date, VitalWorks shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any customer or prospective customer of the Business to alter or terminate their relationship with the Purchaser solely as it relates to the Business as conducted as of the Closing Date, or, violate the terms of their customer contracts with Purchaser at any time after the Closing Date.   

 (e) For a period of five years after the Closing Date, VitalWorks shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any Hired Employees, officers, employees, representatives, independent contractors or agents of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates engaged solely in the Business to leave the employ of Purchaser or any such Affiliate for employment with VitalWorks or its Subsidiaries, or violate the terms of their contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Purchaser or any such Affiliate, except that nothing in this sentence shall restrict or preclude (i) the hiring of employees or independent contractors of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates who approach VitalWorks regarding employment on an unsolicited basis and (ii) the rights of VitalWorks and its Subsidiaries to make generalized searches for employees or independent contractors by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade media) or by engaging search firms to engage in searches that are not targeted or focused on the employees or independent contractors employed by the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of five years after the Closing Date, VitalWorks shall not hire the individuals set forth on _Schedule 7.7(e)_.   

 (f) Prior to Closing, except with respect to Affected Employees or as otherwise agreed in writing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will offer or provide employment on a full-time or part-time or consulting basis to any individual employed by VitalWorks or any of its Affiliates. For a period of five years after the Closing Date, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any officers, employees, representatives or agents of VitalWorks or any of its Subsidiaries to leave the employ of VitalWorks or any of its Subsidiaries, for employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or violate the terms of their contracts, or their employment arrangements, except that nothing in this sentence shall restrict or preclude, (i) the hiring of the Hired Employees, (ii) the hiring of employees of VitalWorks or its subsidiaries who approach Purchaser regarding employment on an unsolicited basis, and (iii) the rights of Purchaser or its Affiliates to make generalized searches for employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade media) or by engaging search firms to engage in searches that are not targeted or focused on the employees employed by VitalWorks or its Subsidiaries.

It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. If all or part of this _Section 7.7_ is held invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. If any part of this _Section 7.7_ is held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject, such part will be construed by limiting and reducing it so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with applicable Law.    ##### Table of Contents

 Section 7.10 _Litigation Support_. Purchaser and its Affiliates on the one hand and VitalWorks and its Affiliates on the other hand will cooperate with each other in the defense or settlement of any Liabilities or lawsuits involving the Business or its former employees for which they have responsibility under this Agreement by providing the other party and such other partys legal counsel and other designated Persons access to employees, records, documents, data, equipment, facilities, products, parts, prototypes and other information regarding the Business and its products as such other party may request, to the extent maintained or under the possession or control of the requested party. The requesting party shall reimburse the other party for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties in performing its obligations under this _Section 7.10_. VitalWorks shall keep Purchaser informed of the status of the pendency of the relevant Liabilities and lawsuits involving the Business for which it has responsibility under this Agreement, will advise Purchaser of material issues involved in the litigation and will use commercially reasonable efforts to seek a confidentiality agreement with respect to any settlements of such lawsuits. For so long as any Liabilities or lawsuits involving the Business for which VitalWorks has responsibility under this Agreement remain outstanding, Purchaser will advise VitalWorks of material issues involved in the lawsuits involving the Business for which it has responsibility and will use commercially reasonable efforts to seek a confidentiality agreement with respect to any settlements of such lawsuits.  

  

  

 Section 7.11 _Insurance_. As of the Closing Date, the coverage under all insurance policies related to the Business shall continue in force only for the benefit of VitalWorks and not for the benefit of Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Business covering all periods after the Closing.  

  

  

 Section 7.12 _Interim Reports_. Until the Closing Date, VitalWorks shall deliver to Purchaser within 30 days after the end of each calendar month (beginning with November 2004) a copy of the Divisions internal income statement as of the last day of such month prepared in a manner and containing information consistent with VitalWorks current practices.  

  

  

 Section 7.13 _Lockbox Accounts_.

Lockbox. VitalWorks will use reasonable efforts to open such Business Lockbox
at a bank to be selected by Purchaser. Effective as of the Closing Date,
VitalWorks shall transfer to, and otherwise vest in, Purchaser the exclusive
right to the Business Lockbox. After the Closing, if Vitalworks comes into
possession of any payments with respect to any accounts receivable related to
the Business, it shall deposit such payments into the Business Lockbox
accounts or other depository accounts, or transfer such payments to another
account designated by Purchaser. If Purchaser comes into possession of any
payments that Purchasers records indicate are not made with respect to an
account receivable related to the Business and owned by Purchaser, it shall
deposit such payments into the separate lockbox account or other depository
account designated by VitalWorks. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
following the Closing, Purchaser or its designees shall have sole dominion
and control over the Business Lockbox account including, without limitation,
the exclusive right to revoke any instructions given to the bank that
maintains the Business Lockbox and the exclusive right to cancel or change
the automatic transfer instructions related to the Business Lockbox account.
Each party shall have the right to inspect the records of the other upon
reasonable request in connection with this _Section 7.13_.

TAX MATTERS   

  

  

 Section 8.1 _Transfer Taxes_. __ All Transfer Taxes attributable to the transfer of the Purchased Assets and any Transfer Taxes required to effect any recording or filing with respect thereto shall be borne by Purchaser, and Purchaser, shall indemnify VitalWorks, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, and representatives for any such Taxes imposed on VitalWorks. VitalWorks and Purchaser shall cooperate to timely prepare any returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Purchaser will file all returns or other filings with respect to Transfer Taxes, and promptly following the filing thereof, Purchaser will furnish to VitalWorks a copy of such return or other filing and a copy of a receipt showing payment of any such Transfer Tax. With respect to any such returns or filings required to be filed by VitalWorks, Purchaser shall pay to VitalWorks, not later than five (5) Business Days before the due date for payment of such Transfer Taxes, an amount equal to the Transfer Taxes shown on such return or other filing, and VitalWorks will furnish to Purchaser a copy of such return or other filing and a copy of a receipt showing payment of any such Transfer Tax.

Purchaser shall be liable for and shall indemnify VitalWorks, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,    ##### Table of Contents

  

 

employees, stockholders, agents, and representatives against all liability
for (i) in the case of any Straddle Period Taxes other than Straddle Period
Taxes based upon income or receipts, the amount of such Straddle Period Tax
for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending after the Closing and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii)
in the case of any Straddle Period Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts, the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period began
after the Closing. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken
into account as though the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner that does not accelerate deductions or defer income. With
respect to any such Straddle Period returns or filings, Purchaser shall pay
to VitalWorks, not later than five (5) Business Days before the due date for
payment of such Straddle Period Taxes, an amount equal to the portion of such
Straddle Period Taxes for which Purchaser is liable under this _Section
8.2(b)_, and VitalWorks shall, following the filing thereof, furnish to
Purchaser a copy of such return or other filing and a copy of a receipt
showing payment of any such Straddle Period Tax. For the avoidance of doubt,
sales and use Taxes (the liability for which is provided in _Section 2.4(f)_
and _2.5(e)_ ) shall not be considered Straddle Period Taxes for purposes of
this _Section 8.2(b)_.  

  

  

 Section 8.3 _Cooperation_. Purchaser and VitalWorks agree to furnish or cause their Affiliates to furnish, to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business (including, access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns and other Tax filings, the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return. Purchaser and VitalWorks shall cooperate, or cause their Affiliates to cooperate, with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes and each shall execute and deliver such other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section 8.3_. Purchaser and VitalWorks shall provide, or cause their Affiliates to provide, timely notice to each other in writing of any pending or threatened Tax audits, assessments or litigation with respect to the Purchased Assets or the Business for any taxable period for which the other party may have liability under this Agreement. Purchaser and VitalWorks shall furnish, or cause their respective Affiliates to furnish, to each other copies of all correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax Audit or information request with respect to any taxable period for which the other party or its Affiliates may have liability under this Agreement.  

  

  

 Section 8.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. (a) Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date VitalWorks shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating the Purchase Price and the liabilities assumed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (or any comparable provisions of state or local tax law) or any successor provision.   

 (b) Purchaser will have the right to make reasonable objections to the Allocation Schedule, if and to the extent Purchaser believes in good faith that the Allocation Schedule was not prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt thereof, in which event Purchaser and VitalWorks will negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections. If Purchaser    ##### Table of Contents

  

  

and VitalWorks cannot resolve Purchasers reasonable objections to the
Allocation Schedule within ten (10) Business Days after VitalWorks receipt
of such objections, such dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule
shall be presented on the next day to a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm jointly chosen by the parties, or, if they cannot agree,
jointly chosen by their respective accounting firms. The accounting firm,
whose review shall be limited to whether a disputed item has been prepared in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, shall render a decision within five (5) Business Days thereafter,
which decision shall be final and binding upon each of the parties. The fees,
costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be shared in equal
amounts by Purchaser and VitalWorks.   

 (c) Purchaser and VitalWorks each shall report all Taxes and file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) consistent with the Allocation Schedule, and shall take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith (including, in any audits or examinations by any taxing authority or any other proceedings), unless, and then only to the extent, required by a Final Determination. Purchaser and VitalWorks shall exchange completed and executed forms with respect to the allocation (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such forms and shall cooperate in the filing of any forms (including Form 8594) with respect to such allocation, including any amendments to such forms required with respect to any adjustment to the Purchase Price, pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the foregoing agreement shall survive the Closing without limitation.

INDEMNIFICATION   

  

  

 Section 9.1 _Indemnification by VitalWorks_. Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_, VitalWorks agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates, and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, judgments, awards, Liabilities, losses, costs or damages (collectively, a " _Loss_ " or the " _Losses_ ") arising directly from (i) any Retained Liability, (ii) any breach by VitalWorks of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, (iii) any breach of any warranty or representation of VitalWorks contained in this Agreement or in the certificate provided to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 4.2(a)_, or (iv) any non-compliance with bulk transfer or similar Laws to the extent the underlying obligation to the creditor is not an Assumed Liability.  

  

  

 Section 9.2 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_, Purchaser agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless VitalWorks and its Affiliates, and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns from and against any and all Loss claimed or arising directly from (i) any Assumed Liability, (ii) any breach by Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement, or (iii) any breach of any warranty or representation of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in the certificate provided to VitalWorks pursuant to _Section 4.3(a)_.    ##### Table of Contents

  

 

  

  

 Section 9.3 _Notice of Claims_. (a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified under this _Article IX_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") has suffered or incurred any Loss, the Indemnified Party shall so notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly in writing describing such Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if known or reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or certificate delivered pursuant hereto in respect of which such Loss shall have occurred. If any action at Law or suit in equity is instituted by or against a third party with respect to which the Indemnified Party intends to claim any Liability as a Loss under this _Article IX_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such action or suit and tender to the Indemnifying Party the defense of such action or suit. A failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice and to tender the defense of the action or suit in a timely manner pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_, except (i) to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby, (ii) to the extent expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was not provided, and (iii) as provided by _Section 9.5_.   

 (b) Each party will provide notice and an opportunity to comment to the other party before filing any report, notification or filing with any Governmental Authority or third party in connection with an event that would be reasonably likely to result in a Loss subject to the indemnification provisions of this Article. In the event a party is required to file any report, notification or filing immediately, such party will provide simultaneous notice to the other party when it files the report with the Governmental Authority.  

  

  

 Section 9.4 _Third Party Claims_. (a) If an Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 9.3_ of the assertion of any third party claim, action, suit or proceeding (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person or entity; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (C) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Partys notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense    ##### Table of Contents

  

 

of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any
determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement
effected by the Indemnified Party.   

 (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the provision of the Indemnifying Party records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the making available of employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may materially adversely affect it other than as a result of monetary damages, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, have the right to control and direct, through counsel of its own choosing, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, the defense and settlement of such Third-Party Claim. In any such Third-Party Claim, the party having the right to control and direct the defense or settlement of the Third-Party Claim is referred to herein as the " _Controlling Party_ " __ and the other Party is referred to as the " _Participating Party_ ". The Participating Party in any such Third-Party Claim shall be entitled to participate fully in the defense of such claim with internal counsel or with outside counsel reasonably acceptable to the Controlling Party, and the Controlling Party shall permit counsel for the Participating Party to attend all significant internal meetings, all meetings with representatives of plaintiffs, hearings and the like. Counsel for the Participating Party also shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comment upon all memoranda of law, pleadings and briefs and other documents relating to the Third-Party Claim, and the Controlling Party and its counsel shall give reasonable consideration to the comments of counsel for the Participating Party. The Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its prior consent, (not to be unreasonably withheld).  

  

  

 Section 9.5 _Expiration_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Closing shall have occurred, all covenants, agreements, warranties and representations made herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Sections 3.1(b)_ or _(c)_ , shall survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all representations and warranties made herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Sections 3.1(b)_ or  _(c)_ , and all indemnification obligations under _Sections 9.1_ and  _9.2_ with respect to any such representation or warranty, shall terminate and expire on, and no action or proceeding seeking damages or other relief for breach of any thereof or for any misrepresentation or inaccuracy with respect thereto shall be commenced after the date which is eighteen months following the Closing Date, unless prior to such date a claim for indemnification with respect thereto shall have been made with reasonable specificity, by written notice given under _Section 9.3_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 5.2_, _5.9_ ,  _5.13_ , _5.14_ and _6.2_ shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and they shall thereafter be of no further force and effect.  

  

  

 Section 9.6 _Certain Limitations_. (a) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Article IX_, neither party hereto shall have any indemnification obligations for Losses under    ##### Table of Contents

  

 

 _Section 9.1(iii)_ (except in connection with a breach of representations
and warranties contained in  _Sections 5.2_, _5.9_ , _5.13_ and _5.14_ ) or
_Section 9.2(iii)_ (except in connection with a breach of a representation
and warranty contained in _Section 6.2_), (i) for any individual item
where the Loss relating thereto is less than $37,500 and (ii) in respect of
each individual item where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater
than $37,500, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds
$1,250,000, in which event VitalWorks shall be required to pay the amount of
such Losses which exceeds $1,250,000, but only up to a maximum amount of
$18,000,000.  

  

  

 Section 9.7 _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc._ The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_  shall be net of (i) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party, (ii) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received as an offset against such Loss (each Person named in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , a " _Collateral Source_ "), and (iii) an amount equal to the present value (utilizing a discount rate equal to the Applicable Rate defined in _Section 2.7(d)_ of the tax benefit, if any, attributable to such Loss. Indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall not be available unless the Indemnified Party first uses commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery from all Collateral Sources. The Indemnifying Party may require an Indemnified Party to assign the rights to seek recovery pursuant to the preceding sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will then be responsible for pursuing such claim at its own expense. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under  _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party to this _Article IX_, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this _Article IX_ had such determination been made at the time of such payment.  

  

  

 Section 9.8 _Other Limitations_. No claim for breach of representation or warranty shall be made by Purchaser under _Section 9.1(iii)_ if (a) such claim is based on a fact or an event occurring prior to Closing (whether or not also occurring prior to the date of this Agreement), (b) such fact or event was disclosed by VitalWorks prior to Closing, and (c) but for an express waiver of the closing condition set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ with respect to such breach, Purchaser would have had no obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

  

  

 Section 9.9 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use all of its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses that an Indemnified Party asserts or is reasonably likely to assert under this _Article IX_. In the event that an Indemnified Party shall fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such Losses, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, neither VitalWorks nor Purchaser, as the case may be, shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party for that portion of any Losses that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided through the exercise of such commercially reasonable efforts.  

  

  

 Section 9.10 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the parties sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement; other than in the case of fraud by another party. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the fullest    ##### Table of Contents

  

 

extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and
causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) for
monetary damages known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may
arise in the future, that it may have against VitalWorks or any of its
Affiliates, or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law (including any
such Law relating to environmental matters or arising under or based upon any
securities Law, common Law or otherwise); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not limit any available remedy for fraud by another
party.  

  

  

 Section 9.11 _No Consequential Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIABLE TO OR OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ANY AFFILIATE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR FOR DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR LOST PROFITS THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH HEREOF OR ANY LIABILITY RETAINED OR ASSUMED HEREUNDER.

TERMINATION   

  

  

 Section 10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   

 (a) by written agreement of Purchaser and VitalWorks;   

 (b) by either Purchaser or VitalWorks, by giving written notice of such termination to the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to January 31, 2005 (the " _Termination Date_ ") (unless the failure to consummate the Closing by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to have fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement); provided, however, that the Termination Date shall automatically be extended for an additional ninety (90) days in the event that all conditions to Closing have been satisfied other than those set forth in  _Section 4.1(a)_ or _4.1(b)_.   

 (c) by either VitalWorks or Purchaser if any court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Governmental Order or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;   

 (d) by Purchaser, if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of VitalWorks set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ of this Agreement not to be satisfied, and such condition shall be incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date; or   

 (e) by VitalWorks, if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would    ##### Table of Contents

  

 

cause the condition set forth in _Section 4.3(a_) of this Agreement not to
be satisfied, and such condition shall be incapable of being satisfied by the
Termination Date.  

  

  

 Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ hereof, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability to the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees, except for the obligations of the parties contained in _Sections 7.1_ ("Information and Documents"),  _11.1_ ("Notices"), _11.7_ ("Public Disclosure"), _11.8_  ("Return of Information"), _11.9_ ("Expenses") and _11.11_  ("Governing Law; Jurisdiction") and _Section 10.2(b)_, and except that nothing herein will relieve any party from Liability for any breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.
