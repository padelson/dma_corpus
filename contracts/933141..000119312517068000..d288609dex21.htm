thereof.

applicable Law which requires that Purchaser withhold or deduct any amounts

this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of any such payment under any applicable Law; _provided_
, that Purchaser shall be required to provide written notice to Parent of the
amount of such withholding or deduction as promptly as practicable after
Purchaser becomes aware of any required withholding or deduction (and, in any
event, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing); _provided_
_further_ , that to the extent any such withholding or deduction by Purchaser
would, individually or in the aggregate, be equal to or greater than the
amount set forth in _Section 2.6_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, then the
parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period of fifteen (15) days
following the delivery of written notice to Parent modifications to this
Agreement in order to mitigate any such withholding or deduction and, if the
parties are unable to so agree on modifications to this Agreement that would
reduce such withholding or deduction by Purchaser to an amount that is less
than the amount set forth in _Section 2.6_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
then Parent shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement during the five (5)
Business Day period following such fifteen (15)-day negotiation period without
any penalty. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, and paid to the
proper taxing authority pursuant to any applicable Law, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to Purchaser
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ")

necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more

inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item

represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing (except to the extent made only as of a specified date, in

business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets

would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Bank Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Parent has previously made available to Purchaser true and complete copies
of the Banks articles of association (the " _Bank Articles_ ") and bylaws
(the " _Bank Bylaws_ ") and the articles or certificate of incorporation or

this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by Parent and the Bank and the consummation
by Parent and the Bank of the Transactions have been duly and validly approved
by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and the Bank and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or the Bank are necessary to
approve this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and the Bank and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser, constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of Parent and the Bank, enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity).

securities of Parent (equity or otherwise) is required by any applicable Law
or its organizational documents to consummate the Transactions.

Section 3.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

the Bank do not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance by
Parent and the Bank with the provisions hereof do not, and will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a 

 



14

 



  right of, or result in, termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration of any obligation or remedy or to the loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) in
or upon any of the properties, assets or rights of Parent, the Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Bank Articles or the Bank
Bylaws, or the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) of Parent or any Subsidiary of the Bank, (ii) except
as set forth on _Section 3.5(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, any Contract
to which Parent (solely with respect to the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries),
the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent (solely with
respect to the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries), the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound
or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
_Section 3.5(b)_ , any Law or any rule or regulation of any self-regulatory
authority applicable to Parent, the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which Parent, the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Bank Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
no consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of, or registrations,
declarations or filings with or notices to, any Governmental Entities or any
third party are required to be made or obtained by Parent, the Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by
Parent or the Bank of this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, except
for (i) filings of applications and notices with, receipt of approvals or no
objections from, and the expiration of related waiting periods required by,
federal and state banking authorities, including applications and notices
under the BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act and Title 6 of the Louisiana Revised
Statutes, (ii) filings of applications and notices with, and receipt
of approvals or non-objections from, the state securities authorities,
applicable securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, and (iii)
such other filings with third parties who are not Governmental Entities the
failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Bank Material Adverse Effect. As
of the date hereof, assuming compliance by Purchaser with its obligations
under this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Bank has knowledge of any reason
why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entities required for the
consummation of the Transactions and listed in items (i) through (iii)
of this _Section 3.5(b)_ would not be obtained on a timely basis.

Section 3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has previously made available to Purchaser true and complete copies

related notes thereto) for the fiscal years ended 2013, 2014 and 2015, and the
unaudited consolidated financial statements (including the related notes
thereto) for the twelve (12)-month period ending December 31,
2016 (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements
have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be expressly indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Bank and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and their respective consolidated results of operations, changes in
shareholders equity and changes in cash flows for the periods then ended

 (b) Neither the Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and since December 31,

and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with

(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are in all material respects under the exclusive
ownership and direct control of the Bank or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom) except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be likely
to be material to the system of internal accounting control of the Bank. The
Bank and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls effective to provide reasonable assurances that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with its managements general
or specific authorizations and (ii) transactions are recorded in conformity
with GAAP consistently applied and applicable Law.

complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of

controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices.

assets, or, to the knowledge of Parent or the Bank, any present or former
officer, director or employee of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries in such
individuals capacity as such, other than Actions that would not, individually

any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in,
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or
remedy or to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) in or upon any of the properties,
assets or rights of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision
of (i) the Purchaser Charter or Purchaser Bylaws, or the articles or
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents)

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, assuming compliance
by Parent and the Bank with their obligations under this Agreement, Purchaser
has no knowledge of any reason why all regulatory approvals from any
Governmental Entities required for the consummation of the Transactions and
listed in items (i) through (v) of this _Section 4.4(b)_ should not be
obtained on a timely basis.

(or incorporated by reference) in the Purchaser SEC Documents comply as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the

unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be expressly
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations,
changes in shareholders equity and changes in cash flows for the periods then

required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of such party, (A) breach any

constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by such
party or (C) otherwise violate any applicable Law. In the event any of the
restrictions in clauses (A) through (C) of the foregoing sentence shall apply,
the parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including
adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of

(3) Business Days following the filing thereof.

(b) All such information shall be held confidential in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Purchaser, Parent and the

46

 



 (c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or
information provided, made available or delivered to Parent, the Bank or
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Parent Disclosure Letter
and the Purchaser Disclosure Letter to the extent explicitly provided therein)
shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or
remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

 

Section 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and with the cooperation of Parent and Bank, Purchaser agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable
(including consummation of the Bank Merger immediately following the
Closing), including using reasonable best efforts to resist, contest or defend
any Actions (including administrative Actions) challenging the Transactions or
the completion of the Transactions, and using reasonable best efforts to seek
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
is in effect and that could restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the
Transactions. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use reasonable best
efforts to prepare as promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all
filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the Transactions, including the
Bank Merger (the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "), and will make all
necessary filings in respect of those Requisite Regulatory Approvals as soon
as practicable (and, in any event, with respect to any applications required
for the Stock Sale with federal and state banking authorities, no later than
twenty-five (25) Business Days after the date hereof). Parent and the Bank
shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to provide such information
that is requested by Purchaser in order to permit Purchaser to prepare and
submit the filings for the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and respond to
requests for additional information from applicable Governmental Entities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, neither
Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall be required to take any action, or commit
to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection
with obtaining or complying with any Requisite Regulatory Approvals that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, properties, assets,
liabilities or results of operations of (x) the Bank and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (y) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
following the Closing (assuming for this purpose that Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries were an entity the size of the Bank and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, in terms of financial metrics (a " _Burdensome Condition_
"). Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, Purchaser shall inform Parent in writing if any Governmental Entity
with jurisdiction over Purchaser or its Subsidiaries has advised or notified
any of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries of such Governmental Entitys
determination to impose a restriction or requirement in connection with or as
a result of the Transactions, which upon compliance therewith would constitute
a Burdensome Condition, including reasonable detail regarding the restriction
or requirement imposed by the Governmental Entity; _provided_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Purchaser be obligated to provide Parent
or the Bank with any information relating to or containing any confidential
supervisory or regulatory examination materials or information.

 



47

 



 (b) Each party will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each party will consult with the other party, in each case
subject to applicable Laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all
information relating to it and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any
filing made with or written materials submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals; provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall either party be obligated to provide the
other party with any information relating to or containing any confidential
supervisory or regulatory examination materials or information. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with the other party
with respect to obtaining all material permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to
consummate the Transactions, and each party will keep the other party apprised
of the status of material matters relating to completion of the Transactions.
No party shall participate in any meeting, or initiate any material
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity relating to the
Transactions without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or
conversation. The parties shall promptly deliver to each other copies of all
filings, correspondence and orders to and from all Governmental Entities in
connection with the Transactions, including seeking the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , that each party may redact such
information as may reasonably be considered proprietary, sensitive or
confidential (including financial projections, business plans or personal
information).

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall, upon request, furnish to each other
party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. In exercising
the foregoing rights, each party shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, each party shall keep the other party reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other party with copies of
notices or other written communications received by it or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Purchaser be
obligated to provide Parent or the Bank with any information relating to
or containing any confidential supervisory or regulatory examination
materials or information.

Section 5.6 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, consistent with
the terms and conditions hereof, Parent and Purchaser shall and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause their Affiliates to, promptly execute, acknowledge and
deliver such instruments, certificates and other documents and take such other
action as a party may reasonably require in order to carry out any of the
Transactions. Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate with
one another to prepare and file all documents and forms and amendments
thereto as may be required by applicable Law with respect to the Transactions.

 

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent and the Bank, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other of
(i) any notice or other

 



48

 



  communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions by or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, (ii) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which, in any such case, relate to
the Transactions or (iii) any change, condition or event (1) that renders or
would reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such
party set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate to an extent such
that the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.3(a)_ , as
applicable, would not be satisfied if the Closing were to then occur or (2)
that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement (including any condition set forth in _Article_ __ _
VI_) to be complied with or satisfied by such party hereunder; _provided_ ,
that no such notification, nor any failure to make such notification, shall
affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies,
or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Subject to any limitations that may be imposed by applicable Law, for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless each of the current or former directors, officers
or employees of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_") to the fullest extent permitted by the
current provisions regarding indemnification of DandO Indemnified Parties
contained in the Bank Articles and the Bank Bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each of the Bank and its Subsidiaries in each
case upon receipt of an undertaking, from such DandO Indemnified Party to repay
such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such DandO Indemnified Party
was not entitled to indemnification hereunder, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or
was a director or officer of the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors or (ii) any matters arising in connection with the
Transactions, and Purchaser shall also advance expenses as incurred in each
case, upon receipt of an undertaking, from such DandO Indemnified Party to
repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such DandO Indemnified Party
was not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In the event any claim is
asserted within such six (6)-year period, all such rights in respect of any
such claim shall continue until disposition thereof.

 

(b) On or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall obtain a directors and
officers liability "tail" insurance policy the material terms of which,
including coverage equal to the amount set forth on _Section 5.8(b)(i)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Closing and which shall provide for a claims period of six (6) years after
the Closing; _provided_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required to
expend for such "tail" insurance policy pursuant to this sentence an aggregate
premium in excess of the amount set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.8(b)(ii)_ of
the Parent Disclosure Letter (the " _Insurance Amount_ ")) and, if Purchaser
is unable to obtain such policy as a result of this proviso, Purchaser shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for a period of six years
following the Closing by payment of such amount.

 



49

 



 (c) In the event that Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Purchaser shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successor and assign of Purchaser assumes the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall survive consummation of
the Stock Sale and the Bank Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her legal representatives.

 

Section 5.9 _Employees_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, (i) the employment of each Business Employee who as
of the date of this Agreement is not already employed by the Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be transferred to the Bank or one of its Subsidiaries
and (ii) the employment of each employee who is not a Business Employee shall
be transferred to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (other than the Bank or
any of its Subsidiaries). All individuals employed by the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing shall automatically become
employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates (which may be the Bank and its
Subsidiaries) as of the Closing. Immediately following the Closing, (i)
Purchaser shall cause each individual employed by the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing who continues in the employment
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (each a " _Continuing Employee_ ") to
(x) receive base salary or wages, as applicable, as well as eligibility to be
considered for incentive compensation (other than with respect to equity
compensation) opportunities pursuant to employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries that are no
less favorable than those provided to each such employee as of immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (y) become eligible to participate in
other Purchaser Plans that are employee benefit plans in which a similarly
situated employee of Purchaser or such of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, who
was employed by Purchaser as of the Closing Date (" _Similar Purchaser
Employees_ ") are eligible to participate, to the extent such Continuing
Employee was eligible to participate in a comparable Bank Plan immediately
prior to Closing. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall (A) be
construed to create (x) any third-party beneficiary rights in any current or
former employee of the Bank, Purchaser or their Affiliates (including any
dependent or beneficiary thereof) or any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement (including any participant in any Bank Plan, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) or (y) any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period or to a particular term or condition of employment
with Purchaser or its Affiliates, or (B) except as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_, limit the ability of Purchaser or its Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any Bank Plan, Purchaser Plan or other benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them.

(b) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Bank and its Subsidiaries
to terminate the participation of each Business Employee in each Parent Plan
and in no event shall any Business Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits
under such Parent Plans with respect to services rendered or compensation paid
on or after the Closing. The parties hereto agree that the Bank and its
Subsidiaries shall have no liabilities or obligations with respect to any
Parent Plan

 



50

 



  for periods on and after the Closing. If requested by Purchaser after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Bank and each of its Subsidiaries
shall terminate, effective as of the Closing Date, any Bank Plan that is
intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined contribution plan under Code
Section 401(k) (a " _401(k) Plan_ "), in which case the Continuing Employees
shall, effective immediately after the Closing, be eligible to participate in
a corresponding Purchaser Plan. If the Bank is requested by Purchaser to
terminate its 401(k) Plan, Purchaser agrees to take all action necessary to
cause the trustee of the corresponding Purchaser Plan to accept a direct
rollover of all or a portion of a Continuing Employees distribution from the
Banks 401(k) Plan, including any 401(k) Plan loans under terms and conditions
established by the administrator of the corresponding Purchaser Plan.

(c) For all purposes (including but not limited to purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit
plans of Purchaser other than any defined benefit pension plan (such employee
benefit plans of Purchaser shall be referred to hereinafter as the " _New
Plans_ ") providing benefits to any Continuing Employee, each Continuing
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Bank and its
Affiliates and their respective predecessors to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any
applicable similar Bank Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date,
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. " _Transition Date_ " means, with respect to any
Continuing Employee, the date Purchaser commences providing benefits to such
employee with respect to each New Plan.

(d) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Transition Date, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans of Purchaser
to the extent coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an
applicable Parent Plan or Business Plan in which such Continuing Employee was
participating immediately prior to the Closing Date (such Parent Plan or
Business Plans collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits
to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under the similar Old Plans in which such
Continuing Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
Transition Date to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

(e) To the extent that any Continuing Employee is (A) terminated without
cause or (B) resigns as a result of being required to relocate such Continuing
Employees principal place of business to a distance of more than forty-five
(45) miles from such Continuing Employees principal place of business as of
the Closing, in either case within one (1) year

 



51

 



  following the Closing, then such terminated Continuing Employee shall be
entitled to receive a severance payment as is set forth on _Section 5.9(e)_ of
the Parent Disclosure Letter (the " _Severance Payments_ ").

(f) Parent may, at its sole discretion, make employment offers to those
Business Employees set forth on _Section 5.9(f)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter to the extent permitted on _Section 5.9(f)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Purchaser, Parent and the Bank shall
cooperate with respect to the issuing of any press release or other public
statements with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_
_that_ , prior to the closing, no party to this Agreement shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to this Agreement and
the Transactions without the prior written approval of the other parties

 Section 5.13 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) _Non-Compete._ For a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing
Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (whether as a stockholder, investor,
member, partner or otherwise) (i) engage in any Restricted Business or (ii)
own the equity securities of, manage, operate or control, any Person that
engages in a Restricted Business. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this
_Section 5.13(a)_ shall not operate to prevent or restrict the direct or
indirect acquisition by Parent or any of its Affiliates (through acquisition,
merger or other strategic transaction) of an interest in any Person that
engages, directly or indirectly, in the Restricted Business if (i) Parents or
any of its Affiliates voting or equity ownership interest in such Person
does not in the aggregate exceed 5% of the total outstanding voting or equity
ownership interests of such Person or (ii) if (A) Parent acquires 51% or more
of the total outstanding voting or equity interests of such Person (including
in a "merger of equals" or similar transaction), (B) such Person engaged,
directly or indirectly, in the Restricted Business prior to Parents
acquisition of the voting or equity ownership interest in such Person, and
(C) either (x) the Restricted Business represents less than 10% of the assets
and revenues of such Person on a consolidated basis or (y) Parent shall within
twelve (12) months after the acquisition of such Person cause such Person to
either wind-down, or enter into a definitive agreement with a non-Affiliate to
sell, any divisions or subsidiaries engaging in the Restricted Business or the
assets relating thereto (provided that in the case of a sale, Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the acquirer in consummating
such sale as promptly as practicable). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Restricted Business_ " means the operation of a commercial banking business
of the type conducted by the Bank and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
anywhere in the State of Florida; _provided_ , that the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall not restrict Parents ability to conduct the
following business through its international branch in Florida (the " _Miami
Branch_ "): (i) providing banking services to the Persons set forth on
_Section 5.13(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the " _Common Clients_ ");
(ii) making new Loans to clients based in Florida in the commercial real
estate, hotel and corporate sectors; _provided_ , that each such Loan must be

clients as of the date hereof of the Miami Branch or (B) any
new international private banking clients of the Miami Branch (including
residential mortgages to such private banking clients); (iv) providing banking
services to Subsidiaries of international corporate clients of Parent or the
Miami Branch, (v) providing banking services to existing and new corporate

permitted under clause (ii) of this proviso), and (vi) providing banking
services to domestic individuals which are family members or affiliated with
an international banking client of Parent or the Miami Branch. Further, the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall not restrict any Person who
becomes an Affiliate of Parent as a result of such Persons acquisition of 51%
or more of the total outstanding equity interests of Parent (including in a
"merger of equals" or similar transaction) from engaging, directly or
indirectly, in the Restricted Business; _provided_ that such Person was not an
Affiliate of Parent prior to the closing of such acquisition. For purposes of
this _Section 5.13(a)_ , (i) " _international_ " shall, with respect to a
Person, mean that the majority of the assets of such Person together with its
Affiliates, on a consolidated basis, are not located in the United States, and
the majority of the revenue of such Person together with its Affiliates, on a
consolidated basis, does not arise from operations in the United States, (ii)
" _private banking_ " shall mean the banking services offered to high net
worth individuals and their family offices, trusts and Affiliated entities,
and (iii) (x) "assets" of a Person shall mean its consolidated total assets
and (y) "revenues" of a Person shall mean (1) the sum of consolidated net
interest income plus consolidated noninterest income or, if such Person does
not report such line items, consolidated net revenues (or comparable line
items), in each case of clause (iii) as set forth in the financial statements
of such Person as of the last day of its most recently completed fiscal year
and for the year then ended.

 



53

employment of the Bank or its Subsidiaries or violate the terms of their
Contracts or any employment arrangements, any Continuing Employee or any
officer, employee, representative or agent of the Bank or its Subsidiaries
employed by the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to the
solicitation or hiring of (A) any such Persons (x) whose employment has ceased
or has been terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates at least six (6)
months prior to such solicitation or hiring, (y) primarily involved in back-
office operations who is not an officer of the Bank and whose employment is
terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (z) who is an officer of
the Bank primarily involved in back-office operations whose employment has
been terminated by Purchaser or its Affiliates at least three (3) months prior
to such solicitation or hiring (but which three (3) month period may, upon the
request of Parent, be waived or shortened at the sole discretion of
Purchaser), (B) any such Persons who respond to general solicitations of
employment through advertising media not specifically directed toward such
Persons; or (C) the employees set forth on _Section 5.9(f)_ of the Parent

use, any customer list of the Bank or its Subsidiaries to solicit Persons
that were customers of the Bank or its Subsidiaries at the Closing Date in
respect of the provision of products or services offered by the Bank or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date hereof; provided, that the
foregoing shall not apply to Common Clients.

(d) If any provision contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, but this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_
shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had
never been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of
the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic
area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law,
or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such
provision not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the
extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a
court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this
Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic
area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained
herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law.

its Subsidiaries (other than the Bank and its Subsidiaries) that exist as of
the Closing Date or that arise in the future from events or occurrences
taking place prior to or as of the Closing Date and from any obligations under
Contracts to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Bank and
its Subsidiaries) is a party (i) under which the Bank or its Subsidiaries are
provided with services, property or other assets that are used in the conduct
of their respective businesses, (ii) that contain any exclusive dealing or
third party referral arrangements imposed on the Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any express non-competition or non-solicitation
covenants that purport to limit the freedom from and after the Closing of the
Bank or its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with any
Person or in any area or (iii) for which there are any costs or expenses that
would be incurred by the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries from and after the
Closing in connection with the termination of such Contracts.

Section 5.15 _Intercompany Arrangements_.

 

(a) Parent and the Bank shall take or cause to be taken such action and/or
make or cause to be made such payments as may be necessary so
that, immediately prior to the Closing, unless otherwise agreed to by the

actions necessary so that Intercompany Receivables or Intercompany Payables
shall have been settled or paid prior to the Closing; _provided_ that, the
parties hereby agree to work in good faith to agree upon mutually acceptable
procedures for the settlement or payment of trailing activities. Following the
Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, retain all books,
records and documents pertaining to all liabilities, Contracts and
arrangements discharged, terminated or settled, as the case may be, pursuant
to _Section 5.15(a)_ above and this clause _(b)_ for a period of seven (7)

(c) In addition, within sixty (60) days following the date hereof, Purchaser
may specify participations held by the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries in
Loans originated by Parent in respect of which Common Clients are borrowers

documentation, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and
will consummate such sale within ninety (90) days following the date hereof;

shares of Purchaser Common Stock representing in the aggregate 5% or more of
the total number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding
(as calculated for purposes of the prior approval requirements of Section

Subsidiaries to, take all actions as promptly as possible (but giving due
regard to the state of the equity and capital markets) to sell the necessary
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock so that, immediately after giving
effect to such sales, Parent and its Subsidiaries own, directly and
indirectly, shares of Purchaser Common Stock representing in the aggregate

might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 5.18(a)_ , then
Purchaser shall give notice to Parent in writing of such claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent Parent has been

to represent the Banks interests in connection with any Tax Contest relating
solely to Excluded Taxes and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense;
_provided_ , that, (i) Parent shall have first notified Purchaser in writing
of its intention to do so and of the identity of counsel, if any, chosen by
the Parent in connection therewith, (ii) Parent shall be liable for any
reasonable expenses, including reasonable fees for outside attorneys and other
outside consultants, incurred in connection with any such Tax Contest, and
(iii) with respect to any such Tax Contest, Parent must first consult, in good
faith, with Purchaser before taking any action with respect to the conduct of
such Tax Contest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not settle any
such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Purchaser and counsel of its own
choosing shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Contest if it reasonably determines that
such Tax Contest could have a material adverse impact on the Taxes of the Bank
or any of its Subsidiaries in a taxable period or portion thereof beginning
after the Closing Date.

 

(ii) In the case of a Tax Contest of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries which
relates to both Excluded Taxes and other items, Purchaser and Parent shall
use reasonable efforts to cause such Tax Contest to be split into separate Tax
Contests, at least one of which relates solely to Excluded Taxes which shall
be governed by _Section 5.18(c)(i)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Purchaser and Parent are unable to split such Tax Contest in accordance
with the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall have the right to control any
remaining Tax Contest relating to both Excluded Taxes and other items;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Purchaser shall provide Parent with
reasonable updates regarding such Tax Contest, and (ii) Parent shall be
entitled to participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not settle any such Tax
Contest without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

any Tax Contest involving the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any
Tax Contest described in Sections 5.18(c)(i) and (ii)).

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, the
Bank and its Subsidiaries shall timely pay all Taxes (including estimated

Agreement.

(f) As of the Closing Date, any Tax sharing or allocation agreement
or arrangement, whether or not written, that may have been entered into
between the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and Parent or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Bank or its Subsidiaries) on the other hand,
shall be terminated, and no payments that are owed by or to the Bank or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be made from the date of this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
procedures with respect to Tax matters shall be governed exclusively by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.18_. The covenants and indemnification provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.18_ shall survive until sixty (60) days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

Domain Names that may be owned by the Bank and its Subsidiaries at Closing)
and (ii) used in connection with the Bank and its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses as of the Closing (the " _Parent Marks_ ") on any and
all materials, including name plates, signage and marketing and promotional
materials, existing on the Closing Date and distributed or available to
customers or other third parties as of the Closing Date until the earlier of
(x) nine months following the Closing Date or (y) the date on which the
conversion of the Bank to Purchasers systems occurs. Parent also agrees to
host a web page accessible via the active Domain Names set forth on _Section
3.17_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter under the heading "Parent Retained
Domain Names" for the sole purpose of redirecting Internet users from such
Domain Name to a website selected by Purchaser or its designees for twelve
(12) months after the Closing, after which time Parent will continue to
maintain the registration for such Domain Name and direct it to an inactive
website for a period of three (3) years. Purchaser, the Bank and their
Subsidiaries shall use the Parent Marks solely in a manner consistent with the
past practice of the Bank and its Subsidiaries and in connection with goods
and services of high quality that reflect favorably on Parent and the Parent
Marks. Further, for twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, at Purchasers
written request, Parent will substitute for the current reference to Banks
business on Parents and its Affiliates corporate websites for a mutually-
agreed message regarding the Transactions and a link to a website or social
media venues of Purchaser. The form and location of the message and link are
set forth on Section 5.20 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as may be amended
by the Parties from time to time. Parent also agrees that Purchaser, the Bank
and their Subsidiaries may, at any time after the Closing Date, use the Parent
Marks (a) in a neutral, non-trademark manner as reasonably necessary to
describe Purchasers acquisition of the Bank and its Subsidiaries, (b) on any
legal documents, agreements and records and on internal items of the Bank
and its Subsidiaries not visible to the public, and/or (c) as required under
applicable Law.

 



58

(as successor-in-interest to Barclays Bank PLC), as amended (the " _Building
Lease_ "), (b) release the Bank from the Building Lease and (c) enter into
the Sublease Agreement with Bank (or the surviving entity following the Bank
Merger). To the extent that the consent of the landlord is not obtained in
respect of the foregoing, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to explore a mutually acceptable alternative to the foregoing.
Following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the parties agree to
cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate a sublease agreement on customary terms and conditions (the "
_Sublease Agreement_ "), which (subject to obtaining consent of the landlord
for the assignment of the Building Lease) will be entered into as of the
Closing, and which will provide for the terms set forth on  _Exhibit A_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with using

any payments, except in accordance with the terms set forth on _Exhibit A_.

Closing; _provided_ _however_ , for the purposes of determining whether or not
any breach or inaccuracy of representation or warranties has occurred and for
determining the amount of any Losses indemnifiable under clause (i) of this
paragraph (including arising from any breach or inaccuracy of _Section_ __ _

partners, managers, officers, employees and agents (each, a " _Parent

_Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Parent
Indemnitee arising out of, resulting from, or relating to of (i) any breach
of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered hereunder or (ii) any breach of
any covenant of Purchaser contained herein; _provided_ _however_ , for the

of representation or warranties has occurred and for determining the amount
of any Losses indemnifiable under clause (i) of this paragraph, the
representations and warranties of Purchaser shall not be deemed qualified by
any references to "material," "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect," or words
of similar import contained in such representation or warranty.

 

Section 8.3 _Matters Involving Third Parties_. Except with respect to Taxes,
which are covered by _Section 5.18_:

 

(a) In order for any Indemnitee to make a claim for any indemnification as
provided for under this _Article VIII_ in respect of, arising out of or
involving a claim or demand made by any Person not a party to this Agreement
or its Affiliates against the Indemnitee (a

 



63

 



  " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnitee must promptly notify the Person
that is obligated to provide such indemnification (an " _Indemnifying Party_
") in writing, of the Third-Party Claim, but any failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to
the Indemnitee under _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ , except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially and adversely prejudiced by
the failure to timely give such notice; _provided_ , a Purchaser Indemnitee is
not required to notify Parent for a Third-Party Claim in connection with the
Scheduled Item. Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall promptly deliver to the
Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been materially and adversely prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

 

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so
chooses by giving written notice to the Indemnitee within fifteen (15) days of
the receipt of notice of the Third-Party Claim, to assume and control the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party who shall be
a recognized law firm with the experience and resources to defend the
Indemnitee against any such Third-Party Claim in such proceeding; _provided_
that such counsel is not objected to by the Indemnitee in its reasonable
discretion;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties agree that, subject to
_Section 8.3(c)_ , Parent shall assume and control the defense of any Third-
Party Claim in connection with the Scheduled Item. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof (except in
the case of a conflict of interest as set forth in _Section 8.3(c)_ ). If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in  _Section 8.3(b)_ to the contrary,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume and control, and the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement of any Third-Party Claim if:

 

(i) the Indemnifying Party does not provide written notice to the Indemnitee
of its election to control the defense of such proceeding within thirty (30)
days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of such proceeding;

(ii) (A) such proceeding involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations, or
(B) such proceeding involves a Governmental Entity; or

(iii) there exists, in the Indemnitees good faith judgment, based on the
advice of outside legal counsel, a conflict of interest between the Indemnitee
and the Indemnifying Party which, under applicable principles of legal ethics,
could reasonably be expected to prohibit a single legal counsel from
representing both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party in such
proceeding.

 



64

 



 (d) Provided that an Indemnitee has given the Indemnifying Party notice of a
Third-Party Claim as required hereunder, unless and until an Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee may defend
against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem
appropriate; _provided_ that, except as set forth in _Section 8.3(c)_ , the
Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying
Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). Without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
or consent to the entry of any judgment, unless such settlement, compromise
or judgment (i) involves only the payment of money damages for which the
Indemnitee is fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party and the payment of
the claim would not exceed the indemnity hereunder, (ii) does not impose an
injunction or other non-monetary relief upon the Indemnitee, (iii) provides
for a full and unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability
with respect to such Third-Party Claim from each claimant or plaintiff in such
Third-Party Claim and (iv) does not involve a finding or admission of any
violation of Law or other wrongdoing by the Indemnitee. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party does not timely elect to assume and control the
defense of the subject Third-Party Claim, or is not permitted to do so
pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ above, then the Indemnitee may conduct and
control, through counsel of its own choosing, the defense of the subject
Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate with and make
available to the Indemnitee such assistance and materials as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnitee.

 

Section 8.4 _Direct Claims_. In the event any Indemnitee should have a claim
against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnitee, the
Indemnitee shall deliver notice of such claim in writing and in reasonable
detail to the Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness. The failure by
any Indemnitee to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such Indemnitee,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been
materially and adversely prejudiced as a result of such failure.

Section 8.5 _Limitations on Liabilit_ _y_.

 

(a) Except for fraud or an Intentional Breach, an Indemnifying Party shall not
be required to indemnify an Indemnitee with respect to any indemnification
claims arising out of or relating to matters described in _Section 8.2(a)(i)_
or _8.2(b)(i)_ (other than claims relating to an inaccuracy or breach of a
Fundamental Representation), unless and until (i) the aggregate amount of
Losses incurred by the applicable Indemnitees with respect to an event or
occurrence and all other events or occurrences arising from substantially
similar, common or reasonably related facts or circumstances exceeds $150,000
(the " _Claim Threshold_ ") (for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of
calculating the Claim Threshold, Losses arising out of claims with respect to
an event or occurrence and all other events or occurrences arising from
substantially similar, common or reasonably related facts or circumstances
shall be aggregated, provided that any such Losses which do not exceed the
Claim Threshold shall not be applied to or considered for purposes of
determining whether the Deductible has been reached) and (ii) the aggregate
amount of the Losses claimed exceeds $10,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in
which event the Indemnitee will be entitled against the Indemnifying Party to
recover Losses in excess of the Deductible. 

 



65

 



 (b) Except for fraud or an Intentional Breach, the maximum aggregate liability
of Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or
_8.2(b)(i)_ (other than claims relating to an inaccuracy or breach of
Fundamental Representations) shall not exceed the Cap. The maximum aggregate
liability of Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

(c) For purposes of determining Losses hereunder, the amount thereof shall be
limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment actually received by the Indemnitee in respect of any such
claim (with such insurance or other proceeds deemed reduced by (i) reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to collecting under such policies
or from such third party and (ii) any deductible associated therewith to the
extent paid; _provided_ that an Indemnitee shall be under no obligation to
seek such recovery.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_
shall not apply to any indemnity claim relating to Tax matters.

(e) The indemnification provisions of this _Article VIII_ (i) shall apply
without regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason of
set-off, limitation or otherwise and (ii) are intended to be comprehensive and
not to be limited by any requirements of Law concerning prominence of language
or waiver of any legal right under any Law.

(f) The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon any
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations set forth in this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition
based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not
affect the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon
such representations, warranties, covenants or obligations.

 

Section 8.6 _Exclusive Remedies Following the Closing_. Following the Closing,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ and except with respect to _Section_ __ _
5.13_, the indemnification provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ and this
_Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the
Indemnitees, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for all matters arising
under or in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, including for
any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth herein, except in the case of fraud or an Intentional
Breach and as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Section 8.7 _Payments_.

 

(a) Once a Loss has been agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally
adjudicated in a final and non-appealable proceeding to be payable pursuant
to this _Article IX_ , the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations
within five (5) Business Days of such agreement or final non-appealable
adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(b) The parties agree that any indemnification made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



66

 



 Section 8.8 _No Right of Contribution_. Parent waives, and acknowledges and
agrees that Parent shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or
assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or
remedy against Purchaser, the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which Parent
may become subject under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents.

 

Section 8.9 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. Recognizing that
Hunton and Williams LLP has acted as legal counsel to Parent and its
Affiliates, and may be deemed to have acted from time to time as legal counsel
to the Bank and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and that Hunton and
Williams LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Parent and certain of its
Affiliates after the Closing, Purchaser, the Bank and its Subsidiaries hereby
waive any conflicts that may arise in connection with Hunton and Williams LLP
representing Parent and its Affiliates after the Closing in connection with
matters arising out of this Agreement, including any disputes between any of
the parties hereto that may arise after the Closing. The foregoing waiver of
conflict is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a waiver of any
legal privilege or work product protection by the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries.

rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such

to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the

unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, so
long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions are not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.

 

Section 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
