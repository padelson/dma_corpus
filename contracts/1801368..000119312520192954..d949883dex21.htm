agreement reasonably acceptable to the Companies with the Exchange Agent
relating to the services to be performed by the Exchange Agent (the "

cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent the Aggregate Closing Number of
Securities and shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, in immediately available cash funds, the aggregate amount of
the Fractional Share Cash Amount. The Exchange Fund shall be held in trust by
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the HoldCos Equityholders and shall not

Aggregate Pro Rata Equityholder Consideration. In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement,

Parent Class A Stock, as applicable, with the Exchange Agent in an amount
sufficient to make such payments.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing (but in any event within two
(2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
or otherwise provide each holder of record of HoldCo Equity, notice advising
such holders of the effectiveness of the Mergers, which notice shall include
(1) appropriate transmittal materials (including a customary letter of
transmittal) specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Book-Entry Equity shall pass only upon the surrender of such
Book-Entry Equity to the Exchange Agent (which shall be deemed to have been
effected upon the delivery of a customary "agents message" with respect to
such Book-Entry Equity or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of such
surrender as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Exchange Agent Agreement), as applicable, such
materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
HoldCos may reasonably agree and (2) instructions for effecting the surrender
of such Book-Entry Equity to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the portion
of the Aggregate Pro Rata Equityholder Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive as a result of the Mergers pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.6_.

 

(d) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of HoldCos Equity by book-receipt of
an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in connection with the surrender
of Book-Entry Equity (or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of surrender
with respect to such Book-Entry Equity, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request), pursuant to such materials and instructions as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_, the holder of such Book-Entry Equity shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver, out of the Exchange Fund, as promptly

Parent Class A Stock equal to such HoldCos Equityholders Aggregate Pro
Rata Equityholder Consideration.

 



15

    

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the HoldCos
Equityholders two hundred-ten (210) days after the Closing shall be delivered

with this _ARTICLE II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
such HoldCos Equityholders Aggregate Pro Rata Equityholder Consideration
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_) upon due surrender of its Book-Entry Equity, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former HoldCos Equityholder
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(f) From and after the Closing, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the HoldCos of the shares of HoldCos Equity that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing. If, after the Closing, any
acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Equity formerly representing any HoldCos
Equity is presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the portion of the Merger Consideration
attributable to such HoldCos Equity.

Section 2.8 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent, the Merger Subs, the Companies, the Exchange Agent
and their Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under U.S. federal income Tax law (or applicable state and local
income Tax law) (such amount, the " _Withholding Amount_ "). In the event that
a recipient that is subject to withholding does not provide Parent or the
Exchange Agent with an amount of cash equal to the Withholding Amount due in
respect of such recipient, Parent either (i)(A) shall, or shall cause, the
Exchange Agent to reduce the amount of Parent Class A Stock such recipient is
otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement by an amount of
Parent Class A Stock reasonably determined by Parent or the Exchange Agent to
equal (or slightly exceed) the Withholding Amount and sell, or cause to be
sold, such Parent Class A Stock into the open market, (B) shall, or shall
cause the Exchange Agent to, use the proceeds of any such sale (together with
any amounts remitted by such recipient) to pay any applicable withholding and
(C) in the event that the proceeds from any such sale of Parent Class A Stock
exceed the applicable Withholding Amount, shall, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to distribute such excess to the applicable recipient or (ii) shall use
Parent cash to pay, or cause to be paid, any Withholding Amount and reduce the
amount of Parent Class A Stock such recipient is otherwise entitled to receive
pursuant to this Agreement by an amount of Parent Class A Stock having a
VWAP, calculated as of the Closing Date, equal to the Withholding Amount. The
Withholding Amount shall be timely remitted to the applicable Governmental
Entity and, to the extent so paid over, shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the
Withholding Amount was deducted or withheld.

notification to, any Governmental Entity, except: (i) for the filing of the

Parent and the Merger Subs are in possession of all Approvals necessary to
own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the

a whole.

documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed or furnished

Analysis and Retrieval system (EDGAR) in full without redaction. The Parent
SEC Reports were, and the Additional Parent SEC Reports will be, prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Parent SEC Reports did not, and the Additional Parent SEC
Reports will not, at the time they were or are filed, as the case may be, with
the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Certifications are each true and correct. Parent
maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Each director and executive officer of
Parent has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements required with
respect to Parent by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and

information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC or
NYSE.

(b) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference
in the Parent SEC Reports fairly present, and the financial statements and
notes to be contained in or to be incorporated by reference in the Additional
Parent SEC Reports will fairly present, the financial condition and the
results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of
Parent as at the respective dates of, and for the periods referred to, in such
financial statements, all in accordance with: (i) GAAP; and (ii) Regulation
S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable, subject, in the case of interim
financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of
which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be material) and the
omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation
S-K, as applicable. Parent has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are not
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports. No financial statements other than those
of Parent are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Parent.

internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of Parents financial reporting and the preparation of Parents
financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

 

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Parent to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange

deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls

has had or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or
impairing any business practice of Parent or any acquisition of property by

Section 5.12 _PIPE Investment Amount_. _Exhibit I_ sets forth true,
accurate and complete copies of each of the subscription agreements (the "
_Subscription Agreements_ ") entered into by Parent with the applicable
investors named therein (collectively, the " _PIPE Investors_ "), pursuant to
which the PIPE Investors have committed to provide equity financing to Parent
in an aggregate amount of at least $200,000,000 (such amount, the " _PIPE
Investment Amount_ "). The PIPE Investment Amount, together with the amount in
the Trust Account at the Closing, are in the aggregate sufficient to enable
Parent to: (a) pay all cash amounts required to be paid by Parent or its
Subsidiaries under or in connection with this Agreement; and (b) pay any and
all fees and expenses of or payable by Parent with respect to the
Transactions. With respect to each PIPE Investor, the Subscription Agreements
are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal,
termination, amendment or modification is contemplated by Parent. Each
Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and,
to Parents Knowledge, each PIPE Investor. There are no other agreements,
side letters, or arrangements between Parent and any PIPE Investor relating
to any Subscription Agreement, that could affect the obligation of the PIPE
Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE
Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements and Parent is not
aware of the existence of any fact or event that may reasonably be expected to
cause such obligations not to be satisfied or would result in the PIPE
Investment Amount not being available to Parent on the Closing Date. No event
has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any material term
or condition of any Subscription Agreement and, as of the date hereof, Parent
has no reason to believe that it or any counterparty to a Subscription
Agreement will be unable to satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis
any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in any
Subscription Agreement. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the
conditions precedent (other than the conditions contained in the other
Transaction Agreements) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute
to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in
the Subscription Agreements on the terms therein.

Section 5.13 _Trust Account_.

 

(a) As of June 30, 2020, Parent had $345,036,874.56 in a trust account (the "
_Trust Account_ "), maintained and invested pursuant to that certain
Investment Management Trust Agreement (the " _Trust Agreement_ ") effective as
of April 29, 2020, by and between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, a New York corporation (" _Continental_ " or " _Trustee_ ")
for the benefit of its public stockholders, with such funds invested in United
States Government securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act. Other than
pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Subscription Agreements, the
obligations of Parent under this Agreement are not subject to any
conditions regarding Parents, its Affiliates, or any other Persons ability
to obtain financing for the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(b) The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and, to the Knowledge
of Parent with respect to Continental, is valid and in full force and effect
and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except insofar as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies.
Parent has complied in all material respects with the terms of the Trust
Agreement and is not in

 



50

    

 breach thereof or default thereunder and there does not exist under the
Trust Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of
time, would constitute such a breach or default by Parent or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the Trustee. There are no separate Contracts, side
letters or other understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied): (i) between Parent and Continental that would cause the description
of the Trust Agreement in the Parent SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any
material respect; or (ii) that would entitle any Person (other than
stockholders of Parent holding Parent Class A Stock sold in Parents initial
public offering who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Parent Class
A Stock pursuant to Parents Charter Documents) to any portion of the proceeds
in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the
Trust Account may be released except: (A) to pay income and franchise taxes
from any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (B) to redeem Parent
Class A Stock in accordance with the provisions of Parents Charter Documents.
There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing with respect to the Trust Account.

(c) As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Companies herein and the compliance by the Companies with
their respective obligations hereunder, Parent has no reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account will not be
satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be available to
Parent on the Closing Date.

 

(d) As of the date hereof, Parent does not have, or have any present
intention, agreement, arrangement or understanding to enter into or
incur, any obligations with respect to or under any Indebtedness.

Section 5.14 _Information Supplied_.

 

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the S-4 Registration Statement / Proxy
Statement will, at the time declared effective by the SEC and at the date
mailed to stockholders of Parent or at the time of the meeting of such
stockholders relating thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The S-4 Registration
Statement / Proxy Statement (other than with respect to information supplied
by Company for inclusion therein) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. 

(b) All information relating to Parent or the Merger Subs provided pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ shall be true and correct in all material respects and
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no
representation, warranty or covenant with respect to statements made in the
S-4 Registration Statement / Proxy Statement or any Parent SEC Reports based
on information supplied by the Companies for inclusion therein.

 



51

    

Section 5.15 _Absence of Certain Business Practices_. As of the date of
this Agreement, (a) Parent and the Merger Subs are, to the Knowledge of
Parent, in compliance with all applicable Specified Business Conduct Laws,
except where the failure to be in compliance with such Legal Requirements
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
(b) neither Parent nor any of the Merger Subs have (i) received written notice
of or made a voluntary, mandatory or directed disclosure to any Governmental
Entity relating to any actual violation of any Specified Business Conduct Law
or (ii) been a party to or the subject of any pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened Legal Proceeding or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
investigation by or before any Governmental Entity related to any actual
violation of any Specified Business Conduct Law, except, in each case, to the
extent any such notice, disclosure, Legal Proceeding or investigation would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.16 _Investment Company Act_. Neither Parent nor any of the Merger
Subs are an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended.

Section 5.17 _Title to Property_. Neither Parent nor any of the Merger Subs
(a) owns or leases any real or personal property or (b) is a party to any
agreement or option to purchase any real property, personal property or other
material interest therein.

 

Section 5.18 _Brokers; Third Party Expenses_. Except as set forth on _Section_
__ _ 5.18_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, no broker, finder, investment
banker or other Person is entitled to any brokerage fee, finders fee or other
similar commission, for which Parent or its Subsidiaries would be liable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by Parent or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates.

expense or subject itself, any of their Subsidiaries or the business of the
foregoing to any imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them
to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of their assets or
properties); (d) the termination of each agreement set forth on _Section_ __ _

agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates of shares of
capital stock or of any business, assets or property, the imposition of any
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own
or exercise control of their respective assets, properties and capital stock,
or the incurrence of any liability or expense.

Parent entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and for other good and valuable consideration, the

hereby agrees that it does not now and shall not at any time hereafter
have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in
the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against, the
Trust Account, regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in
connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or actual business
relationship between Parent and the Companies, this Agreement or any other
matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort,
equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are
collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Claims_ "). Each Company hereby
irrevocably waives any Claims they may have against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of,
or arising out of, any negotiations,

 



66

    

 contracts or agreements with Parent and will not seek recourse against the
Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason
whatsoever (including, for an alleged breach of this Agreement). Each Company
agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this
Agreement and specifically relied upon by Parent to induce it to enter in this
Agreement, and each Company further intends and understands such waiver to be
valid, binding and enforceable under applicable law. To the extent either
Company commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with,
relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Parent, which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against Parent, such Company
hereby acknowledge and agree their sole remedy shall be against funds held
outside of the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit such Company
(or any party claiming on such Companys behalf or in lieu of such Company)
to have any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. In the event either Company
commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating
to or arising out of any matter relating to Parent, which proceeding seeks, in
whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) or the holders of Parent Stock, whether in the
form of money damages or injunctive relief, Parent shall be entitled to
recover from such Company the associated legal fees and costs in connection
with any such action, in the event Parent prevails in such action or
proceeding.

 be, would have been permitted under applicable Law and their organizational

indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of Parents or each of

complete copies of which have been heretofore made available to Parent or its
agents or representatives) on terms not less favorable than the terms of such
current insurance coverage, except that in no event shall Parent or its
Subsidiaries be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess

Subsidiaries for such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2019; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent may cause coverage to be extended

six-year "tail" policies containing terms not materially less favorable than
the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing
or occurring at or prior to the Initial Effective Times and (ii) if any claim

substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each

applicable Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and approval materials
to Parent for its reasonable review, comment and approval. No later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to soliciting the waivers, such Company shall
provide Parent with the calculations and related documentation to determine
whether and to what extent the vote described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.16_ is
necessary in order to avoid the imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of the
Code. Prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that any disqualified

Section 10.3 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement, the
Transaction Agreements and each other document executed in connection with
the Transactions, and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same document and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that
all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by email to counsel
for the other Parties of a counterpart executed by a Party shall be deemed to
meet the requirements of the previous sentence.

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the other Transaction Agreements and any other documents and instruments and
agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto: (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) other
than the rights, at and after the Closing, of Persons pursuant to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.15_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ (which will be
for the benefit of the Persons set forth therein), are not intended to confer
upon any other Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies.

Section 10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement, or the application thereof, is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Legal
Requirement: (a) such provision will be fully severable; (b) this Agreement
will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof; (c) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance
herefrom; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision,
there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid
and enforceable provision as similar in terms of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

Section 10.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, prior to the Closing, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction and immediate injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy and without bond or other security being required,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may
be difficult to prove damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be
difficult to procure suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive
relief and/or specific performance will not

 



80

    

 cause an undue hardship to the Parties. Each of the Parties hereby further
acknowledges that the existence of any other remedy contemplated by this
Agreement does not diminish the availability of specific performance of the
obligations hereunder or any other injunctive relief. Each Party hereby
further agrees that in the event of any action by any other party for specific
performance or injunctive relief, it will not assert that a remedy at law or
other remedy would be adequate or that specific performance or injunctive
relief in respect of such breach or violation should not be available on the
grounds that money damages are adequate or any other grounds. To the extent
any Party brings any Legal Proceeding to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to the Closing and the
Outside Date, the Outside Date will automatically be extended to (i) the 20th
(twentieth) Business Day after such Legal Proceeding is no longer pending or
(ii) such other date established by the court presiding over such Legal
Proceeding.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the consummation the
Transactions, and any action, suit, dispute, controversy or claim arising out
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, or the validity,
interpretation, breach or termination of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of the law that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

 

Section 10.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal courts located in
the State of Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out
of this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of
the Transactions, agrees that process may be served upon them in any
manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such Person and
waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might
otherwise have to such manner of service of process. Each Party and any Person
asserting rights as a third-party beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it
hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any legal dispute, that:
(a) such Person is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
above named courts for any reason; (b) such Legal Proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in such court; (c) such Persons property is
exempt or immune from execution; (d) such Legal Proceeding is brought in
an inconvenient forum; or (e) the venue of such Legal Proceeding is improper.
Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a third-party beneficiary hereby
agrees not to commence or prosecute any such action, claim, cause of action
or suit other than before one of the above-named courts, nor to make any
motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or
removal of any such action, claim, cause of action or suit to any court other
than one of the above-named courts, whether on the grounds of inconvenient
forum or otherwise. Each Party hereby consents to service of process in any
such proceeding in any manner permitted by Delaware law, and further consents
to service of process by nationally recognized overnight courier service
guaranteeing overnight delivery, or by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.8_, any Party
may commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit in a court other than
the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or
judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

 



81

    

(b) TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED,
EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY
BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED
IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OTHER TRANSACTION
AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS, AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM
RELATING THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. IF
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-
PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS. FURTHERMORE,
NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY
SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR
OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

 

Section 10.9 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the Parties agrees that it has
been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and each Party hereto and its counsel
cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents
referred to herein and, therefore, waive the application of any
law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities
in an agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting
such agreement or document.

 

Section 10.10 _Expenses_. At the Closing, Parent and the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, the Companies Transaction Expenses and the Parent
Transaction Expenses in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.9_. If this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE IX_ , each Party
will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to
and in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 10.11 _Reserved_.

 

Section 10.12 _Assignment_. No Party may assign, directly or indirectly,
including by operation of law, either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other Parties. Subject to the first sentence of this _ Section 10.12_, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 10.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Parties.

 



82

    

Section 10.14 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any
Party may, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements: (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right. In the event any provision of any of the other Transaction
Agreement in any way conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement (except
where a provision therein expressly provides that it is intended to take
precedence over this Agreement), this Agreement shall control.

 

Section 10.15 _No Recourse_. Other than the rights, at and after the Closing,
of Persons pursuant to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, no Person,
including the Sponsor, who is not a Party, including any current, former or
future director, officer, employee, consultant, incorporator, partner,
manager, stockholder, unitholder (including the Unitholders of the Companies)
member, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any
financial advisor or lender to, any Party, or any current, former or future
director, officer, employee, consultant, incorporator, partner, manager,
stockholder, member, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee
of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under,
out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement and the
Transactions, or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement and
the Transactions or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach, and,
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, each Party
hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action,
and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements:
(a) each Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims,
demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in
equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a
Party or otherwise impose liability of a Party on any Nonparty Affiliate,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each
Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.

 

Section 10.16 _Disclosure Letters and Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure
Letters and Parent Disclosure Letter shall each be arranged in separate parts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections contained
in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered
part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the
particular representation or warranty set forth in the corresponding numbered
or lettered Section or subsection of this Agreement, except to the extent
that: (a) such information is cross-referenced in another part of the Company
Disclosure Letters or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable; or (b) it is
reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure (without reference to any
document referred to therein or any independent knowledge on the part of the
reader regarding the matter disclosed) that such information qualifies
another representation and warranty of the Company or Parent, as applicable,
in this Agreement. In each case, subject to the language of the applicable
representations and warranties, obligations, covenants, conditions or
agreements contained herein, any item of information, matter or document
disclosed or referenced in, or attached to, the Company Disclosure Letters
will not (a) be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material,"

 



83

    

 "Company Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement
or to establish a standard of materiality, (b) represent a determination that
such item or matter did not arise in the Ordinary Course of Business, (c) be
deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the Companies, Parents or the
Merger Subs respective representations and warranties, obligations,
covenants, conditions or agreements contained herein, (d) constitute, or be
deemed to constitute, an admission of liability or obligation regarding such
matter or (e) constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an admission to any
third party concerning such item or matter. No disclosure in the Company
Disclosure Letters relating to any possible breach or violation of any
agreement or Law will be construed as an admission or indication that any such
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. Capitalized terms used
in the Company Disclosure Letters and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement.

 

Section 10.17 _Release_.

 

(a) _Company Release_. Each Company, on behalf of itself and each of its
respective Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges,

Companys and any of its Subsidiaries respective current and

now or in the future, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from any
matter or cause whatsoever arising prior to the Closing, in each case whether
known or unknown, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, and
whether arising under any agreement or understanding or otherwise, at law or
equity, arising out of or in connection with the ownership by the Unitholders
of the Companies, any Persons service as a director of the Companies and any
acts or omissions of any Person on behalf of the Companies and any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

(b) _Parent Release_. Each of Parent and the Merger Subs, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges,
effective as of the Closing, the holders of Parent Stock, including the

whatsoever that such Person or its Affiliates has or may have, now or in the
future, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from any matter or cause
whatsoever arising prior to the Closing, in each case whether known or
unknown, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, and whether

privilege has been waived as to the Company Privileged Communications, whether
located in the records or email server of such Company or otherwise (including
in the knowledge of the officers and employees) and (iii) not to take any
action that would result in any subsequent waiver of the privilege respecting
the Company Privileged Communications.

 

Section 10.19 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The
representations and warranties in _ARTICLE IV_ and _ARTICLE V_ of this
Agreement and in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement with
