the PIPE Investors have committed to provide equity financing to Parent in an aggregate amount of at least $200,000,000 (such amount, the &#147;<U>PIPE Investment Amount</U>&#148;). The PIPE Investment Amount, together with the amount in the Trust
Account at the Closing, are in the aggregate sufficient to enable Parent to: (a)&nbsp;pay all cash amounts required to be paid by Parent or its Subsidiaries under or in connection with this Agreement; and (b)&nbsp;pay any and all fees and expenses
of or payable by Parent with respect to the Transactions. With respect to each PIPE Investor, the Subscription Agreements are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, in any respect, and
no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is contemplated by Parent. Each Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to Parent&#146;s Knowledge, each PIPE Investor. There are no other agreements, side
letters, or arrangements between Parent and any PIPE Investor relating to any Subscription Agreement, that could affect the obligation of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in
the Subscription Agreements and Parent is not aware of the existence of any fact or event that may reasonably be expected to cause such obligations not to be satisfied or would result in the PIPE Investment Amount not being available to Parent on
the Closing Date. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any material term or condition of any Subscription Agreement and, as of the date hereof,
Parent has no reason to believe that it or any counterparty to a Subscription Agreement will be unable to satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription
Agreement. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions contained in the other Transaction Agreements) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the
PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements on the terms therein. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;5.13 <U>Trust Account</U>. </P>
