Sellers, (B) arise out of underlying events or circumstances to the extent

6.11_, or  _Section 6.14_.

For the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to Assumed Environmental
Liabilities in no event shall the Assumed Liabilities include Excluded
Liabilities.

(b) The transaction contemplated by this Agreement is the purchase
and sale of assets and not a de facto merger between any of Sellers and
Buyers. No Buyer is a successor in interest to any Seller, and neither any

Buyer Employees or pursuant to the Transition Services and Operations
Agreement, any shareholder, officer, director, manager, member or partner of
any Seller, as the case may be, shall have any continuing participation in the

provision of this Agreement, any Schedule or Exhibit or any of the Ancillary
Agreements to the contrary, and regardless of any disclosure to Buyers,
Sellers and Buyers agree that Buyers shall not assume and shall not
be responsible for paying, performing or discharging (and Sellers shall
retain, pay, perform or otherwise discharge without recourse to Buyers) any

similar arrangements of any Seller or its Affiliates and any claims relating
thereto, and (B) to the extent relating to the engagement of any independent
contractor by any Seller or its Affiliates arising from, or related to events,
facts or circumstances occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, including

engagement, compensation and other similar arrangements of any Seller or its
Affiliates and any claims relating thereto;

28 (x) all Liabilities under any Assumed Contracts that are not validly and
effectively assigned to Buyers pursuant to this Agreement including pursuant
to _Section 2.3(a)(i)_ ;

 

(xi) all Liabilities arising from or relating to any pending or threatened

Time; and

 

(xii) all Liabilities related to a Rejected Property; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this  _Section 2.3(b)(xii)_ shall not limit the rights and
remedies available to Sellers with respect to damage, destruction of property
or other casualty events occurring on or to the Rejected Property to the
extent arising from Buyers or their Representatives access to, or inspection
of, the Rejected Properties and the fixtures and personal property located

Section 2.6 Allocation. On or before ninety (90) days after the Closing,
Buyers shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers a schedule
allocating the Purchase Price and any other items constituting consideration
for applicable income tax purposes (to the extent known at such time) among
the Assets in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code (the "
_Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be deemed to be accepted by, and shall
be conclusive and binding on, Sellers except to the extent Sellers shall have
delivered, within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Allocation is
delivered to Sellers, a written notice to Buyers stating each item to which
Sellers take exception (it being understood that any amounts not disputed
shall be final and binding). If a change proposed by Sellers is disputed,
then Buyers and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute.
If, after a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which Sellers
give notice to Buyers of any such proposed change, any such proposed change
still remains disputed, then the Parties shall submit any such remaining
disputed items to a jointly selected accounting firm (the " _Accounting
Referee_ ") who shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those items in
dispute. Within thirty (30) days following submission to the Accounting
Referee, the Accounting Referee will prepare and deliver a written
determination to the Parties with respect to the Allocation (such Allocation
mutually agreed to by the Parties, deemed agreed to by the Parties or finally
determined by the Accounting Referee, as applicable, the " _Final Allocation_
"). The costs of such Accounting Referee shall be borne one-half by Buyers and
one-half by Sellers. The Parties shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts
to update the Final Allocation in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of
the Code following any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Agreement and (b) file all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594, in a manner
consistent with the Final Allocation, as adjusted, unless required to do so
by a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code. The Parties
shall promptly inform one another in writing of any challenge by any tax
authority to the Final Allocation and shall consult and keep one another
informed with respect to the status of such challenge.

the gross Base Price as the value (the " _Assigned Drop Value_ ") of each of
the Station Properties, as set forth on _Schedule 2.7_ attached hereto. The
Assigned Drop Values have been assigned solely for the purposes expressly
described in this Agreement, including, without limitation, for (a) making any
necessary adjustments to the Purchase Price and Closing Cash Payment, as
further specifically described in  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and (b) calculating
the closing expenses, as applicable.

 



31 Section 2.8 Unobtained Lease Consents. If Buyers do not have the right to
use or occupy and operate any Leased Real Properties by the Closing and Buyers
have not elected for such Leased Real Property to be a Rejected Property in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, then an amount (the " _LSP Escrow
Amount_ ") equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of the Assigned Drop
Values for all such Leased Real Properties and (ii) the aggregate LSP
Estimated Inventory Value with respect to all such Leased Real Properties
shall be deposited into the LSP Escrow Account at Closing pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)_ and shall be held in, and released from, the LSP Escrow Account
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Following the Closing, within three (3) Business Days following
such date on which Buyers have the right to use or occupy and operate any such
Leased Real Property in respect of which funds are held in the LSP Escrow
Account, Buyers and Sellers shall take such actions as are necessary to cause
the Leased Real Property and any related Assets to be transferred from Sellers
to Buyers on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent in writing to distribute to or at the direction of Sellers an
amount equal to the Assigned Drop Value for such Leased Real Property,
together with the Final LSP Inventory Value with respect to such Leased Real
Property. If after the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing (or such
later date mutually agreed to by Buyers and Sellers), Buyers do not then have
the right to use or occupy and operate any Leased Real Properties, then Buyers
and Sellers shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to distribute
all remaining funds held in the LSP Escrow Account (not otherwise subject to
distribution pursuant to a prior dated joint written instruction letter
delivered in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence) to or at
the direction of Buyers and Sellers shall retain the Leased Real Property
together with (x) any Assets exclusively related to such Leased Real Property,
including Inventory and (y) all Liabilities to the extent attributable to or
arising from such Leased Real Property, and the Leased Real Property shall be
considered a Rejected Property for all purposes under this Agreement.

 

Section 2.9 Post-Signing Base Price Adjustment.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within (i) fifteen (15)
days after the Signing Date, Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to Buyers (A) the income statement for the Business for the year ended
December 31, 2016 prepared in accordance with the Agreed Principles and (B)
the other documents set forth on _Schedule 2.9(a)(i)_ (the " _2016 Financial
Information_ "), including the income statement for the Business and resulting
calculation of EBITDA for the Business, in each case, for the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 2016 and prepared in accordance with the Agreed Principles,
and (ii) thirty (30) days after Sunoco LP files with the SEC its financial
results for the three months ended March 31, 2017, Sellers shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Buyers (A) the income statement for the Business for
the three months ended March 31, 2017 prepared in accordance with the Agreed
Principles and (B) the other documents set forth on _Schedule 2.9(a)(ii)_ (the
" _2017 Q1 Financial Information_ "), including a calculation of the EBITDA
for the Business for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 (the " _Reference
2017 Q1 EBITDA_ "), which shall be calculated in accordance with the Agreed
Principles. Upon Sellers delivery of the last document comprising the 2016
Financial Information and again upon Sellers delivery of the last document
comprising the 2017 Q1 Financial Information, Sellers shall deliver to Buyers
a certification, certifying that all such information has been provided (each
such certification, a " _Certification of Delivery_ "). Within ten (10) days
following the date of delivery of any Certification of Delivery from Sellers
to Buyers, Buyers may object in writing, notifying Sellers in reasonable
detail of any 2016

 



32  Financial Information or 2017 Q1 Financial Information, as applicable, that
Buyers believe has not been provided, and Buyers and Sellers shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any disputes with respect thereto. If Buyers fail to
object in writing to a Certification of Delivery within the time period set
forth above, then Buyers shall be deemed to have agreed that Sellers have
delivered all of the 2016 Financial Information or 2017 Q1 Financial
Information, as applicable.

(b) Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Buyers receive the
last document comprising the 2016 Financial Information, (i) in the event that
Buyers disagree with Sellers determination of EBITDA for the Business for the
year ended December 31, 2016 based on the Agreed Principles or believe that
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.16(d)_ are not true
and correct in all respects, Buyers may prepare and deliver to Sellers a
written notice of Buyers calculation of EBITDA for the Business for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, together with Buyers claims of
inaccuracies or breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 3.16(d)_ and Buyers proposed adjustments to the calculation of the
Reference 2016 EBITDA based on the Agreed Principles and any such breach or
inaccuracy and any related proposed adjustments to the Base Price calculated
in accordance with _Section 2.9(g)_ (the resulting amount, " _Buyers_ __
_Proposed 2016 Adjustment_ ") and (ii) Sellers may prepare and deliver to
Buyers a written notice of any proposed adjustments (which adjustments, for
the avoidance of doubt, may be upwards adjustments) to Sellers prior
calculation of the Reference 2016 EBITDA, together with Sellers proposed
adjustments to the Reference 2016 EBITDA and any related proposed adjustments
to the Base Price calculated in accordance with  _Section 2.9(g)_ (the
resulting amount, " _Sellers_ __ _Proposed 2016 Adjustment_ ," and together
with Buyers Proposed 2016 Adjustment, the " _2016 Adjustments_ "). If either
Buyers or Sellers do not prepare and deliver the written notice contemplated
by this _Section 2.9(b)_ within the time periods required hereby, then Buyers
or Sellers, as applicable, shall be deemed to have waived any right to object
to the calculation of the Reference 2016 EBITDA for the purposes of this
_Section 2.9_; _provided_ that the failure to deliver such notice shall not
restrict the ability of Buyers or Sellers, as applicable, to object to any
adjustments to the Reference 2016 EBITDA proposed by the other parties
hereto. All proposed adjustments to the Reference 2016 EBITDA must be
calculated in accordance with the Agreed Principles. Solely for purposes of
this _Section 2.9_, none of the limitations set forth in _Section 8.4(a)_ or
_Section 8.4(b)_ shall apply with respect to breaches or inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.16(d)_ (Financial
Statements).

 

(c) Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Buyers receive the
last document comprising the Q1 2017 Financial Information, (i) in the event
that Buyers disagree with Sellers determination of EBITDA for the three
months ended March 31, 2017, Buyers may prepare and deliver to Sellers a
written notice of Buyers calculation of EBITDA for the Business for the
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017, together with Buyers proposed
adjustments to the Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA and any related proposed
adjustments to the Base Price calculated in accordance with _Section 2.9(h)_
(" _Buyers_ __ _Proposed 2017 Adjustment_ ") and (ii) Sellers may prepare and
deliver to Buyers a written notice of any proposed adjustments (which
adjustments, for the avoidance of doubt, may be upwards adjustments) to
Sellers prior calculation of the Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA, together with
Sellers proposed adjustments to the Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA and any related
proposed adjustments to the Base Price calculated in accordance with _Section
2.9(g)_ (the resulting amount, " _Sellers_ __ _Proposed 2017 Adjustment_ ,"
and together with Buyers Proposed 2016 Adjustment, the " _2017 Adjustments_
"). If

 



33  either Buyers or Sellers do not prepare and deliver the written notice
contemplated by this _Section 2.9(c)_ within the time periods required hereby,
then Buyers or Sellers, as applicable, shall be deemed to have waived any
right to object to the calculation of Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA for the
purposes of this _Section 2.9_ and, if neither Buyers nor Sellers timely
delivers such notice, the Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA shall become the Final
2017 Q1 EBITDA; _provided_ that the failure to deliver such notice shall not
restrict the ability of Buyers or Sellers, as applicable, to object to any
adjustments to the Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA proposed by the other
parties hereto. All proposed adjustments to the Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA must
be calculated in accordance with the Agreed Principles.

 

(d) Buyers and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the items
reflected in any 2016 Adjustments and any 2017 Adjustments and agree upon any
adjustments to the Reference 2016 EBITDA (it being understood and agreed that
any such adjustments shall be calculated on a net basis, taking into account
any agreed upon upward and downward adjustments) and Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA
(it being understood and agreed that any such adjustments shall be calculated
on a net basis, taking into account any agreed upon upward and downward
adjustments), as applicable, and the resulting adjustments to the Base Price
calculated in accordance with _Section 2.9(g)_. Buyers and Sellers shall be
restricted from bringing up adjustment items under this _Section 2.9_ which
are not reflected in the notices called for pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_ and
_Section 2.9(c)_ above, other than disputes that refute an adjustment made by
either Sellers or Buyers, respectively, in such notices. If Buyers and
Sellers, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such
dispute within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the 2016 Adjustments or
2017 Adjustments, as applicable, then Buyers and Sellers, jointly, shall
engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such outstanding dispute. As promptly
as practicable thereafter (and, in any event, within five (5) days after the
Arbitration Firms engagement) and subject to the limitations described above,
Sellers and Buyers shall submit any unresolved elements of their dispute to
the Arbitration Firm in writing (with a copy to Buyers or Sellers,
respectively), supported by any documents upon which it relies. Buyers and
Sellers shall direct the Arbitration Firm to choose either Buyers position in
its entirety or Sellers position in its entirety based solely on the
submissions by Buyers and Sellers, and request that the Arbitration Firm
render its determination within fifteen (15) days following receipt of the
submissions from Sellers and Buyers. The Arbitration Firm may not review the
calculation of the 2016 Adjustments or 2017 Adjustments, as applicable, using
a principle or methodology which deviates from the Agreed Principles but may
take into account the effect that any breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.16(d)_ would be deemed
to have on the 2016 Reference EBITDA and the Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA. Neither
Sellers nor Buyers nor any of their respective Representatives shall have any
_ex parte_  conversations or meetings with the Arbitration Firm without the
prior written consent of the other party, as applicable (other than with
respect to ministerial matters similar to matters that would be discussed with
a clerk of a court). The Party whose position is not chosen by the
Arbitration Firm shall be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the
Arbitration Firm. Absent fraud or manifest error, all determinations made by
the Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties,
and absent fraud or manifest error, no party shall be entitled to appeal such
determination or bring any additional Proceeding, pursuant to this Section 2.9
or otherwise, with respect to the matters that were the subject of
such determination.

 



34 (e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this  _Section
2.9_, each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other party
and its Representatives all applicable information, records, data and work
papers and shall permit access to its facilities, personnel and
outside financial and accounting advisors as may be reasonably required in
connection with the preparation and analysis of the 2016 Financial Information
and the Q1 2017 Financial Information and the adjustments contemplated hereby.

 

(f) The Reference 2016 EBITDA, as adjusted to account for any upward or
downward adjustments as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_ shall
be referred to as the " _Final 2016 EBITDA_ " and the EBITDA for the Business
reflected therein for the three months ended March 31, 2016 shall be referred
to herein as the " _Final 2016 Q1 EBITDA_ ". If the Final 2016 EBITDA exceeds
Reference 2016 EBITDA then there shall be no adjustments to the Base Price in
respect of the 2016 Financial Information. If the Reference 2016 EBITDA
exceeds Final 2016 EBITDA (the amount of any such excess, the " _2016 EBITDA
Shortfall_ "), then the Base Price shall be decreased at Closing by an amount
equal to the product of (A) the 2016 EBITDA Shortfall multiplied by (B)
the Reference Multiple.

(g) The Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA as adjusted to account for any upward or
downward adjustments as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_ shall
be referred to as the " _Final 2017 Q1 EBITDA_." If the Final 2017 Q1 EBITDA
exceeds Final 2016 Q1 EBITDA or if Final 2016 Q1 EBITDA exceeds Final 2017 Q1
EBITDA by Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) or less, then in either case
there shall be no adjustment to the Base Price in respect of the 2017
Financial Information. If the Final Q1 2016 EBITDA exceeds Final 2017 Q1
EBITDA by an amount in excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), then the
Base Price shall be decreased at Closing by an amount equal to the product of
(1) (A) the Final Q1 2016 EBITDA, minus (B) the Final Q1 2017 EBITDA, minus
(C) Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), multiplied by (2) the Reference
Multiple. Solely for the purposes of calculating any adjustment pursuant to
this Section 2.9(f), if the Reference 2016 Q1 EBITDA is less than the Final
2016 Q1 EBITDA, then the Final 2016 Q1 EBITDA shall be deemed to equal the
Reference 2016 Q1 EBITDA.

(h) In the event the provisions of this _Section 2.9_ result in any
adjustment to the Base Price, then this Agreement shall be deemed
automatically amended to provide (i) that the Base Price, as adjusted, shall
become the Base Price for all purposes under the Agreement and (ii) the
Assigned Drop Values for each Station Property set forth on _Schedule 2.7_
shall each be automatically reduced by the same proportion as the Base Price
is reduced in accordance with this _Section 2.9_, and Buyers shall promptly
provide an updated _Schedule 2.7_ prepared in accordance with this clause
(ii), which shall replace the existing _Schedule 2.7_ for all purposes under
the Agreement. Upon the completion of any adjustment to the Base Price
pursuant to this  _Section 2.9_, no further claims for adjustment may be
brought pursuant to this _Section 2.9_.

 

(i) In the event that the Final 2016 EBITDA or the Final 2017 Q1 EBITDA
differs from the Reference 2016 EBITDA or the Reference 2017 Q1 EBITDA,
Sellers shall be entitled to update the income statements corresponding with
respect to which Sellers are making certain representations and warranties in
_Section 3.16(b)_ hereof, in order to cause such income statements to
accurately reflect any items the parties agree or the Arbitration Firm
determines should be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ in the Final
2016 EBITDA or the Final 2017 Q1 EBITDA. Upon Sellers delivery to Buyers of
such updated income statements, if any, such

 



35  updated statements shall be deemed to be the income statements referred to
in _Section 3.16(b)_ for all purposes under this Agreement, including for
purposes of determining whether or not there has been any breach of any
representation set forth in _Section 3.16(b)_.

of any nature on the

 



54  ability of the Business to operate or compete, including exclusivity
provisions, non-competition provisions, non-solicitation provisions or any
other restrictive covenant; (ii) any arrangement containing or granting most
favored nations or similar pricing provisions; or (iii) except for actions in
the Ordinary Course of Business, any action that would result in increased
Liabilities to third parties under an Assumed Contract; and

 

(x) not authorize, contract, commit or otherwise agree whether in writing
or otherwise to take any of the actions set forth in _clause (c)_ or
_clauses (h)_ - _(w)_ of this _Section 5.2_.

 

Section 5.3 Notice of Certain Events. From and after the Signing Date until
the Closing, Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify each other in writing of (a) any change, event, circumstance,
development, condition, occurrence or effect of which it becomes aware that
has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or
will or is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in
_Article_ __ _ VII_ becoming incapable of being satisfied, (b) any written
notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and (c) any written notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.4 Efforts; Filings.

 

(a) Under the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement
(including _Section 5.5_,  _Section 5.8_ and _Section 5.9)_, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, each Buyer and each Seller shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to) use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, agree to take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, any and all things necessary, proper or advisable
under any Law or otherwise, so as to, as promptly as practicable, consummate
Buyers purchase, and Sellers sale, of the Assets and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including (i)
defending against any Proceeding challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) seeking to have
any Order entered or imposed by any court or other Governmental Entity that is
not yet final and non-appealable vacated or reversed, (iii) cooperating with
the other Parties to obtain all actions, non-actions, approvals, clearances,
waivers, consents (including the Contract Consents), Permits, approvals,
authorizations, licenses, qualifications and Orders from, or filing
or registration with or notice to, Governmental Entities as are necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and (iv) refrain from taking any actions that would
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or impede the Closing;
provided, _however_ , that (A) Sellers, together with their Affiliates, shall
not be required to commence or participate in any litigation or offer or grant
any material accommodation (material or otherwise) to any third person and
(B) no Party shall be required to waive any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall not be
applicable to HSR Regulatory Approval, which is specifically addressed by
_Sections 5.4(c)_ and _5.4(d)_.

 

(b) Each of Sellers and Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
not cause or, with respect to its controlled Representatives permit, take any
act or omission to act that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
representations and warranties of Sellers

 



55  or Buyers, respectively, contained herein not to be true and correct in any
material respect if such representations and warranties were made immediately
after such act or failure to act, in either case so as to cause the failure
of any condition to the Closing set forth in either _Section 7.1_ or _Section
7.2_, in the case of Sellers, or _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_, in the case
of Buyers, respectively, to be satisfied.

(c) Buyers and Sellers acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may require filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division
under the HSR Act. Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.4(a)_ , each
of Buyers and Sellers shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period and/or to take
any other action to obtain any approval, authorization, clearance, Order,
Permit or consent by any Governmental Entities required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act (" _HSR
Regulatory Approval_ "). In connection with the HSR Regulatory Approval,
Buyers and Sellers shall each, subject to applicable Law and if permitted: (i)
as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 15
Business Days from the Signing Date, make all filings or registrations with,
notification to the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission under
the HSR Act in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements ("
_HSR Filings_ "), and thereafter promptly make any other submissions and
responses requested by a Governmental Entity (including promptly responding to
any request for additional information) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; (ii) furnish all
information reasonably requested by any other Party for any HSR Filings to be
made by any Party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; (iii) act in good faith and
reasonably cooperate with each other Party in connection with any HSR Filings
(including, by providing each other Party or their Representatives
a reasonable opportunity to comment on any submissions to a Governmental
Entity in connection with obtaining the HSR Regulatory Approval, considering
all such comments in good faith and furnishing copies of all HSR Filings to
outside counsel for a non-filing Party and, if requested, to such other
Party); (iv) keep each other Party informed with respect to any substantive
communication received from, or given to, any Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
brought under antitrust Law by a private party, in each case, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; (v)
provide each other Party with prior notice of any proposed understanding,
undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any HSR
Filings; (vi) reasonably consult and cooperate with each other Party in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals submitted by or on behalf of any Party in
connection with proceedings relating to obtaining the HSR Regulatory Approval;
and (vii) unless prohibited by any Governmental Entity, make commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that each other Party has an opportunity to
attend any meeting and, where possible, to participate in any substantive
communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any HSR Filings, the
HSR Regulatory Approval or any investigations or other inquiries relating
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, information and materials may be redacted or
withheld (A) to the extent that such information and materials concern or
refer to matters other than the Business or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements; and
(C) because information is protected under the attorney client or other
privilege, absent the entry of a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement.
Sellers shall

 



56  bear and pay any and all filing fees required to be paid by Sellers or
Buyers under the HSR Act (which fees shall be considered Covered Transaction
Expenses). Except as stated in the preceding sentence, Sellers and Buyers
shall each bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation and filing of the HSR Filings and obtaining HSR Regulatory
Approvals.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in _Section 5.4(c)_ , subject to  _Section 5.4(f)_, Buyers shall
take or cause their Subsidiaries to take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary to obtain the HSR Regulatory Approval and to resolve objections, if
any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements under the HSR Act or any other
antitrust Law, including proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effect
(and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree,
hold separate order, or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture or disposition of
such assets or businesses that Buyers deem appropriate, or (ii) any
commercially reasonable action (including any action that limits its freedom
of action, ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, any of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of
Buyers, any of their respective Subsidiaries, or the Business) which it is
lawfully capable of taking (any such action, a " _Remedial Action_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , for purposes of this _Section 5.4_, "commercially
reasonable efforts" shall be deemed to include any sale, divestiture
or disposition of any Station Properties that represent, in the aggregate up
to Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000) in Assigned Drop Value (it
being understood that, to the extent Buyers determine to pursue a Remedial
Action that requires the sale, divestiture or disposition of either (1) a
station property owned by Buyers or (2) a Station Property located in close
geographic proximity thereto, then for purposes of this sentence, any station
properties owned by Buyers that are being divested due to being located
within close geographic proximity to a Station Property shall be ascribed and
Assigned Drop Value equal to the Assigned Drop Value for the Station Property
geographically proximate thereto that Buyers elect not to sell, divest or
dispose of). If Buyers determine to sell, divest or dispose of a Station
Property pursuant to this _clause (d)_ , Sellers may designate such Station
Property as a Rejected Property and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted by
the Assigned Drop Value assigned to such Station Property and the Station
Property shall be treated as a Rejected Property for all purposes under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall also be entitled to, in
their sole discretion, consent to any other Remedial Action with respect to
any Station Properties designated as Rejected Properties under this _Section
5.4(d)_ ; _provided_ that, if Sellers do not consent to any such Remedial
Action, then Buyers may, in their sole discretion, remove such Station
Property as a Rejected Property.

(e) Buyers and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate and mutually agree on
the strategies, tactics, process of obtaining the HSR Regulatory Approval,
_provided_ that, Buyers shall have final say regarding the strategy, process,
negotiation of settlement (if any), and determination of any Remedial Action,
including for the avoidance of doubt the marketing or sale of any part of
Sellers, Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates businesses or assets.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 5.4_, any
reasonable actions or strategies pursued by Buyer (i) to avoid, resist or
reduce the scope of any action that may be sought or required to satisfy the
conditions herein or (ii) pertaining to the submission of all required
notifications to Governmental Entities and obtaining the consent of any
Governmental Entity, shall be deemed consistent with its obligations under
this _Section 5.4_ so long as such action or strategy is consistent
with Buyers commercially reasonable efforts and does not delay satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ to a date beyond the End Date.

 



57 (f) Subject to the proviso in _Section 5.4(d)_ but notwithstanding else
anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall this _Section 5.4_
require, or be construed to require, (i) any Buyer or its Affiliates to, or to
offer to, propose or agree to: (A) any sale, divestiture or disposition
of any Station Properties that represent, in the aggregate, in excess of
Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000) in Assigned Drop Value (it being
understood that, to the extent Buyers determine to pursue a Remedial Action
that requires the sale, divestiture or disposition of either (1) a station
property owned by Buyers or (2) a Station Property located in close geographic
proximity thereto, then for purposes of this sentence, any station properties
owned by Buyers that are being divested due to being located within close
geographic proximity to a Station Property shall be ascribed and Assigned Drop
Value equal to the Assigned Drop Value for the Station Property geographically
proximate thereto that Buyers elect not to sell, divest or dispose of); or
(B) any undertakings or conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in,
the operations of any such assets, businesses or interests which, in either
case, could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect or
materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Buyers of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) Buyers or Sellers to
consent to any material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

Section 5.5 Environmental and Equipment Integrity Testing Matters.

(a) _Environmental Site Inspections_. The Station Properties have been and
are being used by Sellers and their respective predecessor(s) in title as
retail gasoline facilities and convenience stores. Following the Signing Date,
Sellers shall perform Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (the " _Phase I
ESAs_ ") in accordance with the Phase I Protocols, including inspections of
any existing remediation systems, at all of the Station Properties by one or
more Approved Environmental Consultants. Sellers shall perform an invasive
Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (" _Phase II ESAs_ ") at each Station
Property in accordance with the Phase II Protocols by one or more Approved
Environmental Consultants in the event that (i) (A) reasonable and credible
evidence in a Phase I ESA indicates that Contamination is likely to exist at
a level that is likely to be required to be investigated, assessed, removed,
remediated or monitored under applicable Environmental Law for which no NFA
Status has been achieved or (B) a Phase I ESA provides reasonable and
credible evidence of current or historical dry cleaning operations on or
adjacent to the Station Property; (ii) a Fuel Equipment Inspection reveals,
indicates or uncovers reasonable and credible evidence that a release of
Hazardous Materials that exceeds reportable or actionable levels for
remediation established pursuant to Environmental Laws is likely to have
occurred and for which for which no NFA Status has been achieved; (iii) a UST
at a Station Property is thirty (30) years old or older, single-walled and
constructed of a material other than steel; (iv) a Station Property was issued
an incident report by a Governmental Entity for the release of Hazardous
Materials at the Station Property for which no NFA Status has been achieved;
(v) a failed tank tightness or ullage test, line tightness test or secondary
containment test on the Fuel Equipment at a Station Property indicates that
there has been a release of Hazardous Materials resulting in Contamination
for which no NFA Status has been achieved; (vi) the requirements of any
applicable state land transfer statute or similar Law ( _e.g._ , New Jersey)
requires the performance of invasive sampling or testing activities and (vii)
a Phase

 



58  I ESA indicates the reasonable likelihood of a Material Environmental
Condition. Sellers shall provide Buyers with a copy of any Phase I ESA report
or Phase II ESA report promptly after the report is issued. Sellers shall
cause each Approved Environmental Consultant upon hiring of such consultant to
grant in writing the right for Buyers to rely on the Phase I ESA or Phase II
ESA, as applicable, performed by such consultant in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyers. Buyers shall have the right to have their own
contractors present at Buyers sole cost (it being understood that such costs
and expenses shall be borne by Buyers and shall not be Covered Transaction
Expenses) (and Sellers shall give Buyers seven (7) Business Days prior
written notice of) the time of any such invasive testing to confirm compliance
with the Phase I and Phase II Protocols, and to obtain split samples of any
soil or groundwater obtained by Sellers Approved Environmental Consultant.
Buyers acknowledge and agree that Buyers shall not be permitted to perform any
invasive sampling or testing at the Station Properties prior to Closing and
that Sellers shall not be required to perform any invasive sampling or
testing at the Station Properties other than to the extent required by this
_Section 5.5(a)_.

 

(b) _Fuel Equipment Inspections and Repairs_.

 

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, Sellers
shall engage the services of contractors mutually acceptable to Buyers and
Sellers (the " _Fuel Equipment Contractors_ ") to conduct with respect to the
Fuel Equipment on or under each Station Property, and in accordance with the
Tank and Line Testing Protocols, (A) a visual inspection of such Fuel
Equipment, including under dispenser containers or dispenser pans (UDCs), STP
and overfill sumps, dispensers, and vapor recovery equipment, and (B) a test
of such Fuel Equipment in accordance with the Tank and Line Testing
Protocols, including testing of underground storage tanks, lines, leak
detectors, automatic tank gauges and cathodic protection testing, if any
(collectively, the " _Fuel Equipment Inspections_ "). Sellers shall provide
Buyers with a copy of the Fuel Equipment Contractors final report for each
Station Property promptly after the reports are issued, subject to Buyers
agreement to maintain confidentiality and return or destroy, at Buyers
election, all such reports if this Agreement is terminated. Sellers shall
arrange to have an environmental representative at each Station Property when
the testing is conducted in order to make any minor repairs or adjustments
required in order to complete the tests. In addition, Sellers shall, at their
expense, make any repairs necessary to permit the Fuel Equipment Inspections
described in the Tank and Line Testing Protocols to be properly conducted.
Sellers shall arrange to have the Fuel Equipment Inspections performed in
accordance with the timetable as reasonably agreed by Buyers and Sellers.

 

(ii) If the Fuel Equipment Inspections, or inspections conducted pursuant
to _Section 5.5(b)(i)_ , disclose any leaks, cracks, damage or improper
installation, maintenance or repair in, to or with respect to the Fuel
Equipment that requires Fuel Equipment Repairs in order to comply with
applicable Laws and/or manufacturer specifications or nationally recognized
standards (i.e., PEI, STI, NFPA30 or PCI) (such specifications and standards,
the " _Standards_ "), the Fuel Equipment Contractors shall promptly advise
Buyers and Sellers and provide an estimate of the costs of such Fuel
Equipment Repairs. Sellers shall promptly, at their expense, complete any Fuel
Equipment Repairs ( _i.e._ , repair any identified problems that, absent
immediate repair,

 



59  could result in Contamination or require tank replacement and those repairs
required to comply with applicable Laws and Standards). Sellers shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to complete such Fuel Equipment Repairs
prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall ensure that all Fuel Equipment
Repairs are completed with oversight from, and consultation with, Buyers in
accordance with the Tank and Line Testing Protocols and in such a manner that
repaired Fuel Equipment complies with applicable Laws and/or Standards, and
Sellers shall cause the repaired Fuel Equipment (or the affected component) to
be re-tested and, if necessary, re-certified as to tightness, by the Fuel
Equipment Contractors. If any such retest discloses any leaks, cracks, damage
or improper installation, maintenance or repair in, to or with respect to the
Fuel Equipment that requires Fuel Equipment Repairs in order to comply with
applicable Laws, applicable manufacturer specifications for such repairs and
the Standards, Sellers shall conduct the repair and retest requirements until
the Fuel Equipment Inspections reveal no leaks, cracks, damage or improper
installation, maintenance or repair in, to or with respect to the Fuel
Equipment that requires Fuel Equipment Repairs in order to comply with
applicable Laws and/or Standards. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to restore the surface condition of the affected Properties to a
condition at least equal to the condition prior to the repair or replacement.
Sellers shall discuss with Buyers any Fuel Equipment Repairs to be made prior
to making such Fuel Equipment Repairs so as to facilitate the installation of
any upgrades or other improvements not required hereunder that may be
contemplated or desired by Buyers. Any such additional upgrades or
improvements desired by Buyers would be done at Buyers incremental expense
(i.e., above the cost of the Fuel Equipment Repairs to be otherwise performed
by Sellers hereunder).

 

(iii) If Contamination is identified during Fuel Equipment Inspections or
Fuel Equipment Repairs that requires Governmental Entities to open an
incident number with respect to such Contamination, then Sellers shall in a
prompt manner undertake at their sole cost and expense those Remediation
Activities necessary to address such Contamination in accordance with and to
the extent required by applicable Environmental Law. Such Remediation
Activities shall be completed by Sellers in a good and workmanlike manner with
due diligence, in compliance with applicable Laws and shall be undertaken
in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with Buyers or other
third parties actual or expected operations at the respective Station
Property. Following the Closing, Buyers shall provide Sellers with reasonable
access to the affected Station Properties in order to perform any required
Remediation Activities and, at the Closing, shall execute and deliver to
Sellers a Site Access Agreement, as defined in _Section 6.1(a)_ , for each
such Station Property. To the extent Remediation Activities are necessary,
Sellers shall ensure that the condition of the affected properties is restored
to its condition prior to the initiation of such Remediation Activities.

 

(iv) Sellers shall notify Buyers in writing at least ten (10) days in
advance of performing any Fuel Equipment Repairs, so that Buyers or their
consultants or contractors may be present to observe.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Phase II ESA Activities and Fuel Equipment Inspection
and Repairs_. In the event that the Phase II ESAs contemplated by _Section
5.5(a)_ or Fuel Equipment

 



60  Inspections and Repairs contemplated by _Section 5.5(b)_ of this Agreement
cannot be completed prior to the Closing Date, Buyers hereby expressly agree
to continue to provide Sellers with a non-exclusive right of access to the
Station Properties, in accordance with the applicable Site Access Agreement,
so that Sellers can complete additional Phase II ESAs and Fuel Equipment
Inspections and Repairs (the " _Post-Closing Inspection and Repair
Activities_ "). The Parties shall agree on the Station Properties for which
Post-Closing Inspection and Repair Activities are required, and the timing of
such Post-Closing Inspection and Repair Activities, and such Station
Properties and timing schedule shall be identified on _Schedule 5.5(c)_ that
is added to this Agreement by amendment prior to the Closing Date. Any Post-
Closing Inspection and Repair Activities shall be conducted in accordance
with _Section 5.5(a)_ and _Section 5.5(b)_ of this Agreement, as applicable.

 

(d) _Termination as to Property_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if Buyers determine, in their reasonable
discretion, prior to the Closing or, with respect to any Station Property for
which a Phase II ESA has not been completed prior to thirty (30) days before
the Closing, the thirtieth (30th) day after the date of completion of the
applicable Phase II ESA, that a Material Environmental Condition exists at
such Station Property, then Buyers may elect to treat such Station Property as
a Rejected Property and reduce the Purchase Price by the Assigned Drop Value
assigned to such Station Property. Additionally, if Sellers determine, in
their reasonable discretion, prior to the Closing or, with respect to any
Station Property for which a Phase II ESA has not been completed prior to
thirty (30) days before the Closing, the thirtieth (30th) day after the date
of completion of the applicable Phase II ESA, that a Material Environmental
Condition exists at such Station Property that would be reasonably likely to
result in Liabilities to Sellers in excess of the Assigned Drop Value plus
Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) for each such Station
Property, then Sellers, in their sole discretion, may notify Buyers of their
desire to treat such Station Property as a Rejected Property, and such Station
Property shall be treated as a Rejected Property and the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to such Station Property;
_provided_ that any Covered Transaction Expenses related to such Rejected
Property shall be deducted from Excess Covered Transaction Expenses. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyers and Sellers may designate one or more Station
Properties as Rejected Properties, so long as such Station Property(ies) fit
the criteria in this _Section 5.5(d)_.

 

Section 5.6 Title to Real Property.

 

(a) Following the Signing Date, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (i) to the extent in the possession
or control of Sellers, provide the Title Company copies of the most recent
existing title policies (if any) with any Sellers as the insured with respect
to the Real Property or any portion thereof, order the commitments for such
Title Policies and cause the Title Company to perform a real property title
search with regard to the Owned Real Properties and the Leased Real
Properties, and to deliver to Buyers and to Sellers a commitment to issue a
Title Policy (each, a " _Commitment_ ," and together, the " _Commitments_ ")
to be issued by the Title Company with regard to the fee interests in the
Owned Real Properties and the leasehold interests in the Leased Real
Properties and (ii) to the extent in the possession or control of Sellers,
provide the Surveyor copies of the most recent existing surveys (if any) of
the Real Property or any portion thereof, order the surveys and cause the
Surveyor to complete and deliver to Buyers current as-built, ALTA/ACSM
surveys for the

 



61  Owned Real Properties and the Leased Real Properties (collectively, the "
_Surveys_ "). Buyers shall have the right to determine the insured value under
each Commitment for each Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate amount of all such values shall
not exceed an amount equal to the Base Price, minus the Assigned Drop Value of
any Rejected Properties. The cost of obtaining the Commitments and the
Surveys shall be borne in accordance with _Section 9.4(b)_. Buyers may, no
later than thirty (30) days after receipt of a Commitment and Survey for a
Station Property (the " _Title Objection Date_ "), deliver written notice to
Sellers of any matter set forth in such Commitment (excluding any Liens or
matters created by Buyers examination or inspection of the Assets including
any entry upon any Real Property in connection therewith) or Survey that is
unacceptable to Buyers (such matters being collectively referred to herein as
" _Defects_ ," and each a " _Defect_ "). If Buyers do not deliver such written
notice to Sellers on or before the applicable Title Objection Date, Buyers
shall be deemed to have waived any right to object to any title matter, or any
other matter set forth in the applicable Commitment or Survey, shall accept
title with respect to such Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property,
and shall proceed to the Closing without any reduction in the Purchase Price
with respect to same. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
following shall be deemed Defects whether or not included in a notice of
Defect and whether or not any notice of Defect is delivered by Buyers: (i) any
liens and encumbrances securing payment of money, (ii) any lis pendens or
judgment Liens, and (iii) all matters (including Liens and requirements set
forth in the Commitments) related to violations of Law or Permits and (iv) any
Lien created or placed on any of the Assets in violation of _Section 5.2(j)_
(collectively, the items described in _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ , the "
_Non-Permitted Encumbrances_").

 

(b) If, on or before the applicable Title Objection Date, Buyers deliver
written notice to Sellers of a Defect, Sellers shall, within fifteen (15)
days after receiving such notice, notify Buyers in writing whether Sellers
will or will not attempt to cure such Defect. Failure by Sellers to deliver
such notice shall be deemed Sellers election not to cure such Defect;
provided, however, that the preceding sentence shall not apply to Non-
Permitted Encumbrances, which Sellers shall attempt to cure if Buyers deliver
written notice of any such Non-Permitted Encumbrances to Sellers. If Sellers
elect (or are deemed to have elected) not to attempt to cure a Defect, then,
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount reasonably necessary, as
determined in good faith by Sellers and Buyers to cure such Defect or to
account for any diminution in the value of the applicable Real Property
resulting from the existence of such Defect and upon application of such
Purchase Price reduction Buyers shall be deemed to have waived such Defect
(including for purposes of Article VIII) or, if the amount to cure such
Defect, as determined in accordance with the foregoing, exceeds 15.0% of the
Assigned Drop Value or materially and adversely affects the ownership or
operation of such Real Property, at Buyers option, such Real Property shall
be designated as a Rejected Property, in which case the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to the applicable
Station Property on _Schedule 2.7_ and such affected Real Property shall no
longer be a part of the Assets being transferred hereunder. Excluding the
matters described in the last sentence of _Section 5.6(a)_ , any title matters
that are not objected to by Buyers on or before the applicable Title
Objection Date, or are objected to and cured (or not cured but are waived by
Buyers as set forth above) before the Closing, shall be deemed " _Permitted
Real Property Encumbrances_."

(c) If Sellers elect in writing pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)_ to attempt to
cure a Defect, but at the time of the Closing such Defect has not been cured
or insured over at Sellers

 



62  cost to Buyers reasonable satisfaction, then, at Buyers option, (i) the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount reasonably necessary, as
determined in good faith by Sellers and Buyers to cure such Defect or to
account for any diminution in the value of the applicable Real Property
resulting from the existence of such Defect and upon application of such
Purchase Price reduction Buyers shall be deemed to have waived such Defect
(including for purposes of Article VIII) or (ii) the applicable Real Property
shall be designated as a Rejected Property, in which case the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to the applicable
Station Property on _Schedule 2.7_ and such affected Real Property shall no
longer be a part of the Assets being transferred hereunder.

 

(d) If at any time after the later of the date that Buyers deliver notice
of a Defect or the applicable Title Objection Date (i) a Commitment or Survey
is amended or (ii) the Title Company or the surveyor otherwise discloses to
Buyers or Sellers a new matter or materially and adversely amends any matter
previously approved or deemed approved by Buyers or (iii) the Title Company
materially and adversely amends the terms under which the Title Company is
willing to issue its policy of title insurance, then Buyers shall have ten
(10) Business Days from its receipt of notice of such amendment or
disclosure, together with legible copies of all documents mentioned in such
amendment or disclosure, to deliver a notice of Defect to Sellers with respect
to the applicable Real Property or Leased Real Property.

 

(e) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as
practicable prior to the Closing Date, request and obtain waivers of any
ROFRs held by any third party pursuant to a Material Contract that contains a
ROFR as set forth in _Schedule 3.19_. If a third party exercises a ROFR, or a
waiver of such ROFR is not obtained prior to Closing, in respect of any Real
Property, including the Real Property Leases more particularly described in
_Schedule 1.1(vi)_, such Real Property shall be designated as a Rejected
Property, in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned
Drop Value assigned to the applicable Station Property on _Schedule 2.7_ , and
such affected Real Property shall no longer be a part of the Assets being
transferred hereunder. Sellers shall provide Buyers with written notice of any
such exercise of a ROFR promptly following receipt thereof.

Section 5.7 Inspections and Entry.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth herein and in _Section 5.5(a)_ , all
inspections conducted by or on behalf of Buyers shall be conducted at Buyers
sole expense by qualified inspectors or contractors, selected by Buyers. Any
entry upon any Real Property by Buyers or any of Buyers Representatives, for
the purpose of conducting such inspections shall be upon not less than forty
eight (48) hours prior written notice (which may be by e-mail) to Sellers,
and shall be subject, in any event, to prior scheduling and coordination
with Sellers, and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers with respect
to such scheduling and coordination. At Sellers election and sole cost and
expense, a Representative of Sellers shall be entitled to be present during
any entry by Buyers or Buyers Representatives upon the Real Property to
conduct the inspections. All inspections shall be performed in a manner that
will not unreasonably interfere with or disturb ongoing operations of Sellers
or any third party operators at the Station Properties and Buyers shall as
soon as reasonably practicable repair any damage caused by Buyers inspection.
Subject to _Section 5.1_, prior to the CIC Conversion Date for each Station
Property (or any termination of this Agreement), Buyers shall not approach,
contact or involve itself in

 



63  any discussions or negotiations with any employee of any Seller or with any
other occupant of such Station Property, without Sellers prior written
consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and
without Sellers (or Sellers designated representative) being present thereat.
Prior to Buyers or their Representatives accessing any Real Property and
conducting tests or installing equipment thereon, Buyers shall provide
Sellers with a certificate of insurance naming the applicable Seller as an
additional insured and evidencing liability coverage in form and substance
acceptable to Sellers in an amount not less than Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000) and an aggregate limit of at least Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000).

(b) No more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, Buyers may enter
the Station Properties to install internet/telephone lines and other equipment
needed to effect an orderly post-Closing transition of the operations
conducted thereon. Such entry and installation (i) shall be at Buyers sole
risk and expense; (ii) shall be at such times as selected by Buyers and
reasonably approved by Sellers, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and (iii) may be conducted by a Buyer or
through its agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors. Buyers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to not materially disturb the existing
operations on the Station Properties and shall keep the Station
Properties free from any Liens or claims arising out of any work performed,
material furnished, or obligations uncured by or on behalf of Buyers. If any
mechanics or other Lien is recorded against such Station Properties as a
result of Buyers installation of equipment and the Closing does not occur,
Buyers shall cause the Lien to be discharged of record within ninety (90) days
after receiving notice of such Liens recording.

 

(c) If the Closing does not occur, and Buyers have installed equipment on
the Station Properties in accordance with  _Section 5.7(b)_ , Buyers shall
upon thirty (30) days written notice from Sellers remove the equipment
installed by Buyers and restore the Station Properties to materially the
condition existing immediately prior to Buyers installation of such
equipment; _provided_ that, if after good faith efforts, Buyers need more time
to complete such activities, Sellers shall cooperate to provide Buyers with a
reasonable extension of time; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Buyers fail to
comply with the foregoing requirements, Buyers shall be deemed to have
transferred title to any equipment installed by Buyers to Seller that owns the
applicable Station Property, at no cost and without any express or
implied warranty, after which such Seller shall be solely responsible for
such equipment.

 

Section 5.8 Permits. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at
their reasonable cost and expense, to transfer to any Buyer or its nominee or
designee on the applicable CIC Conversion Date the Permits included in the
Assets, to the extent transferable under applicable Law, and necessary for the
operation of the Business. Buyers shall reasonably cooperate with all of
Sellers actions in connection therewith. With respect to any Permits that are
not transferable under applicable Law or cannot be transferred to the
applicable Buyer on or prior to the applicable CIC Conversion Date despite
commercially reasonable efforts having been undertaken, such Buyer shall be
responsible for obtaining such Permits and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate
with all of such Buyers actions in connection therewith, including by
executing all documents or applications required for such Permits and any
interim management or other agreements permitted by applicable Law.

 



64 Section 5.9 Consents.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain and deliver to Buyers the written consent of each counterparty to
the Real Property Leases and the Third Party Leases where such consent is
required to assign such lease to the applicable Buyer at the Closing, which
consent shall be in the form required by the applicable Real Property Lease
or Third Party Lease or, if no form is provided, in a form mutually agreeable
to the Parties, and, in the case of the Ground Leases, shall be in recordable
form (if required by such Ground Lease) in the form required by the
applicable Ground Lease, if any such form is provided (each, a " _Lease
Consent_ "). Sellers shall keep Buyers reasonably informed with respect to the
status of any such Lease Consents, including by providing Buyers with
reasonable advance notice of and the opportunity, to the extent permitted by
the counterparty to such Real Property Lease, to participate in any meetings
with any counterparty for the purpose of discussing such Lease Consent. If,
despite the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, any Seller is unable
to (i) assign any Real Property Lease to the applicable Buyer at the Closing
for any reason, including due to failure to obtain a Lease Consent, or (ii)
with respect to any Non-Transferred Contract relating to any Real Property
Lease, enter into a management agreement or similar contractual arrangement
with the applicable Buyer in accordance with _Section 5.9(e)_ or
otherwise establish the applicable Buyer as a proper subtenant pursuant to
such Real Property Lease, having such rights and privileges as mutually agreed
upon by the Parties, then Buyers shall be permitted to either (A) designate
the applicable Leased Real Property as a Rejected Property, in which case the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to the
applicable Station Property on _Schedule 2.7_ and such affected Station
Property shall no longer be a part of (1) the Assets being transferred
hereunder and (2) all Liabilities to the extent attributable to or arising
from such Leased Real Property shall no longer be part of the Assumed
Liabilities or (B) request in writing prior to Closing that Sellers continue
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Buyers the
applicable Lease Consent following the Closing, in which case Sellers shall
(1) continue to own and operate the applicable Leased Real Property, for
Buyers benefit and account and, to the extent applicable, in accordance with
the covenants set forth in _Section 5.2_ ( _provided_ that Buyers shall
assume management of the applicable Leased Real Property pursuant to
the terms of the Transition Services and Operations Agreement), (2) not
transfer to Buyers at Closing the applicable Real Property Lease or any Assets
exclusively related to such Leased Real Property and (3) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such Lease Consent following Closing, until such
time as specified in the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at the
earliest practicable date and, in any event, prior to the Closing, amendments
to each of the Real Property Leases with a primary term that expires on or
prior to January 2, 2018, listed on _Schedule 5.9(b)_ adding the lease term
renewal options and other amendments specified on _Schedule 5.9(b)_
(collectively, the " _Lease Amendments_ "); _provided_ that, to the extent
that Sellers are unable to obtain any Lease Amendment prior to the Closing,
such Leased Real Property shall be designated as a Rejected Property, in which
case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned
to the applicable Station Property such affected Station Property shall no
longer be a part of (i) the Assets being transferred hereunder and (ii) all
Liabilities to the extent attributable to or arising from such Leased Real
Property shall no longer be part of the Assumed Liabilities. As promptly as
practical, Sellers shall deliver true and complete copies of each of the Real
Property Leases listed on _Schedule 5.9(b)_ to Buyers and, after Buyers
review of such leases, Buyers and Sellers shall mutually agree to the
parameters of the lease amendments to be set forth on _Schedule 5.9(b)_.

 



65 (c) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at
the earliest practicable date and, in any event, prior to the Closing, all
consents (the " _Contract Consents_ ") required with respect to the transfer
of the Assumed Contracts (other than the Lease Consents, which are addressed
in  _clause (a))_ and the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 5.9(c)_ (the "
_Affiliate Contracts_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not be
required to make any payments or any other economic concession to obtain any
Contract Consents. If, despite the exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts, any Seller is unable to (i) assign any Assumed Contract to the
applicable Buyer or obtain the requisite consent under any Affiliate Contract
at the Closing for any reason, including due to failure to obtain a Contract
Consent, or obtain any Lease Amendment at the Closing for any reason or (ii)
enter into a contractual arrangement with the applicable Buyer in accordance
with _clause (e)_ , having such rights and privileges as mutually agreed upon
by the Parties that provide the applicable Buyer with the benefit of the
Assumed Contract, from and after Closing, then Buyers shall be permitted to
designate the applicable Station Property associated with such Assumed
Contract, Lease or Affiliate Contract as a Rejected Property, in which case
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to the
applicable Station Property on _Schedule 2.7_ , such affected Station
Property shall no longer be a part of the Assets being transferred hereunder
and such Assumed Contract or Lease shall no longer be part of the Assumed
Contracts.

 

(d) The failure of Sellers to obtain any Lease Consents, Contract Consents
or Lease Amendments prior to the Closing shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a breach of this Agreement, including for purposes of _Article VII_
and _Article X_. For the avoidance of doubt, neither this Agreement nor the
applicable Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall constitute a sale,
assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale,
assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of the Assumed
Contract to which such Lease Consent, Contract Consent or Lease Amendments
relates if such Lease Consent, Contract Consent or Lease Amendments has not
been obtained prior to the Closing. Following the Closing, the Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to obtain
any Lease Consent, Contract Consent or Lease Amendments that has not yet been
obtained and is not associated with a Rejected Property as soon as
practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Sellers nor Buyers shall be
required to make any payments to any Person or make any other economic
concession to permit Sellers to obtain any Lease Consent, Contract Consent or
Lease Amendments. Upon obtaining such Lease Consent, Contract Consent or Lease
Amendments following the Closing, each Seller who is a party to the
applicable Assumed Contract or Affiliate Contract shall promptly assign,
transfer, convey and deliver such Assumed Contract or Affiliate Contract to
the applicable Buyer and such Buyer shall assume the obligations under such
Assumed Contract, from and after the date of assignment to such Buyer,
pursuant to a special purpose assignment and assumption agreement
substantially similar in terms to those of the applicable Assignment and
Assumption Agreement (which special-purpose agreement the Parties shall
prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such transfer).

 

(e) To the extent that Sellers are unable to obtain any Lease Consent,
Contract Consent or Lease Amendments and the Closing occurs, (i) the
applicable Seller shall continue to

 



66  be bound by the obligations arising under the terms and conditions of the
Assumed Contract or Affiliate Contract to which such Lease Consent, Contract
Consent or Lease Amendments relates (a " _Non-Transferred Contract_"), (ii)
with respect to any Non-Transferred Contract relating to a Third Party Lease
or Real Property Lease, the applicable Seller shall enter into a management
agreement or similar contractual arrangement with the applicable Buyer under
which such Buyer shall, subject to the provisions of the Transition Services
Agreement, (A) assume management of the operation of the Station Property to
which such Non-Transferred Contract relates on behalf of such Seller, (B) act
as such Sellers agent to perform all of such Sellers obligations under such
Non-Transferred Contract, including the obligation to pay any costs, expenses
and charges reasonably incurred by Sellers, such as labor, rent and similar
charges, in accordance with the terms of such Non-Transferred Contract, and
(C) receive the benefits of such Non-Transferred Contract and operation of the
Station Property, including all proceeds or other compensation received by
such Seller pursuant to such Non-Transferred Contract or in connection with
the operation of the Station Property and attributable to such Buyers
performance of such Non-Transferred Contract and operation of the Station
Property in the post-Closing period, (D) with respect to any Non-Transferred
Contract relating to an Assumed Contract, at the applicable Buyers request,
the applicable Seller shall cooperate with such Buyer to establish a
reasonable arrangement designed to provide such Buyer with the benefits and
burdens of such Non-Transferred Contract, including appointing such Buyer to
act as its agent to perform all of the applicable Sellers obligations under
such Non-Transferred Contract and to collect and promptly remit to such Buyer
all compensation received by any Seller pursuant to such Non-Transferred
Contract and attributable to such Buyers performance of such Non-Transferred
Contract in the post-Closing period, (E) unless directed by a Buyer, no Seller
shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of
the terms and conditions of such Non-Transferred Contract, and (F) the
applicable Seller shall seek to enforce, at the direction of such Buyer, and
for the account and benefit of such Buyer, any and all rights of such Seller
against any other Person arising out of the breach or cancellation of such
Non-Transferred Contract by such other Person or otherwise (any and all of
which arrangements shall constitute, as between the Parties, a
deemed assignment or transfer); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not obligate any Seller to commence or participate in any material
Proceeding relating to the enforcement of such Non-Transferred Contracts
absent an undertaking by Buyers, reasonably acceptable to Sellers, to (1)
reimburse Sellers for all fees, costs and expenses related to such actions and
(2) indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all Losses relating to or arising from such actions.

 



67 Section 5.10 Termination of Contracts Other Than Assumed Contracts or
Affiliate Contracts. Sellers shall terminate, at least effective as of the
Closing, all Contracts effective at or prior to the Closing with respect to
their application to the applicable Station Properties which are not Assumed
Contracts (except with respect to Contracts that are necessary for the
continued operation of a Station Property in the Ordinary Course of Business
or in order to comply with a Partys obligations under the Transition Services
and Operations Agreement, which Contracts shall be terminated with respect to
such Station Property on the applicable CIC Conversion Date).

 

Section 5.11 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation. The restrictive
covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are intended and necessary
to protect the Assets, the Business and other interests and rights being
acquired by Buyers under this Agreement as well as the other legitimate
business interests of Buyers and their respective Affiliates.

 

(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the third
(3rd) anniversary thereof, except as expressly permitted under this _Section
5.11_, neither Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates (collectively,
the " _Restricted Parties_ "), directly or indirectly, shall engage in the
business of owning, leasing or operating convenience stores or any facility
that sells motor fuels on a retail basis (including but not limited to motor
fuels, food, beverage and merchandise sales) (collectively, " _Restricted
Activities_ ") in the " _Restricted Area_ ," which is defined as the
geographic regions set forth on _Schedule 5.11(a)_, nor shall any Restricted
Party, directly or indirectly, be employed by, invest in, have any ownership
interest in, participate in, act as a consultant or lender to, provide
services to (as an employee, director, officer, member, principal, licensor,
trustee, broker, agent, stockholder, partner, or in any other capacity),
operate, assist, represent, advise or otherwise provide support to, any
Person that engages in or plans to engage in any Restricted Activity in the
Restricted Area.

 

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the third
(3rd) anniversary thereof, none of the Restricted Parties shall, without the
prior written consent of Buyers, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage,
cause, induce to hire or hire, interfere in the business relationship of or
enter into an employment agreement, consulting agreement or service
relationship with (i) any Buyer Employee or (ii) any other senior level or
manager level (including store managers or above) employee or consultant of
Buyers or their Affiliates other than Buyer Employees. The
foregoing restrictions are not intended to preclude general solicitations in
newspapers or similar mass media not targeted towards Buyer Employees or other
employees or consultants of Buyers or their respective Affiliates.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the restrictions in  _Section 5.11(a)_ shall not
apply to the following:

(i) any investment by a Restricted Party in any Person that is traded on a
national securities exchange if the Restricted Parties collectively hold less
than 2% of the outstanding voting securities of such Person;

 

(ii) the continued operation of the Station Properties by Sellers prior to
the applicable CIC Conversion Date;

 



68 (iii) the current or future business activities of Sellers at the
convenience store locations and retail fuel outlets set forth on _Schedule
5.11(c)(iii)_ (which shall be comprised of convenience store locations owned,
operated or franchised by Sellers as of the Signing Date that are not
Station Properties) and any Rejected Properties, but only to the extent such
future activities constitute Ongoing Operations. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Ongoing Operations_ " shall mean, with respect to any
convenience store location or retail fuel outlet set forth on _Schedule
5.11(c)(iii)_ or Rejected Property, business operations conducted after the
Closing Date which are (A) conducted only at the same physical location and
address for such location as of the Signing Date and (B) consistent with the
business operations being conducted at such location as of the Signing Date
and (ii) the sale of consigned fuel owned by Restricted Parties at independent
commission marketers and the provision of fuel and other related services to
independent distributors and dealers by Restricted Parties (including the
provision of services to APlus franchisee operations with such independent
parties), in each case in markets where the Station Properties are located;

(iv) owning and operating convenience stores and retail fuel outlets
that are either (A) acquired in connection with the acquisition of (1) any
Person or group of Related Persons that are not primarily engaged in the
retail fuel business in the Restricted Area, (2) all or any portion of the
business or assets of any Person or Persons, which business is not primarily
engaged in the retail fuel business in the Restricted Area or assets are not
primarily composed of assets related to the retail fuel business in the
Restricted Area or (B) are re-acquired from a franchisee in connection with
the conversion or termination of an existing franchise (such locations in
_clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ collectively, " _Acquired Stores_ "), in each case,
for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months after the date on which such
stores are acquired or re-acquired, as applicable, and in each case subject to
_Section 5.11(d)_ ; and

(v) owning or operating a wholesale fuel distribution business.

 

(d) Buyers shall have a ROFR on each Acquired Store in the event any
Restricted Party seeks to sell or franchise such Acquired Store or convert
such Acquired Store to be commissioned marketer operated (each such event, a "
_ROFR Event_ "). Each Restricted Party shall first send a notice to Buyers of
its intention to effect a ROFR Event (a " _ROFR Notice_ "), which ROFR Notice
shall contain the material terms and conditions (including price and form of
consideration, if applicable), the identity of the proposed acquirer,
franchisee or commissioned marketer, as applicable, if known, and the
intended date of the proposed ROFR Event. Buyers shall be entitled to accept
such offer by sending a response notice to such Restricted Party within thirty
(30) days of receipt of such ROFR Notice and, if no such acceptance notice is
timely delivered, Buyers ROFR solely with respect to such offer in respect of
such ROFR Event that is the subject of such ROFR Notice shall expire. If
Buyers elect to exercise their ROFR with respect to any such ROFR Event,
Buyers and such Restricted Party shall negotiate in good faith and cooperate
in promptly preparing definitive documentation and consummating such
transaction.

 

Section 5.12 Removal of Excluded Assets. With respect to each Station
Property, on or prior to the applicable CIC Conversion Date, Sellers shall
remove all Excluded Assets (other

 



69  than those Excluded Assets owned by third Persons) from the Real Property,
as well as signs, signage or advertising bearing or displaying Excluded Assets
or any names, marks, or trade dress, except, in each case, to the extent
required to continue ongoing operations of such Real Property in the Ordinary
Course of Business (such as branded fuel signage for a brand that will
continue to be utilized past the applicable CIC Conversion Date). Sellers
shall provide to Buyers, prior to the applicable CIC Conversion Date, evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Buyers that all such Excluded Assets have been
removed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after good faith efforts,
Sellers need more time to comply with the foregoing, the Parties shall
cooperate to provide Sellers with a reasonable extension of time. Any such
Excluded Assets not removed from the applicable Station Property by ninety
(90) days following the applicable CIC Conversion Date or such date as may be
determined pursuant to an extension under this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall be
deemed abandoned by Sellers, and Buyers may dispose of such Excluded Assets in
whatever manner Buyers may elect; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
Buyers transfer or otherwise dispose of any such Excluded Assets following the
applicable CIC Conversion and prior to the date that is ninety (90) days
following the applicable CIC Conversion Date such that they are no longer
located at the Station Property, Sellers shall have no further right to
recover such Excluded Assets from Buyers and Buyers shall not be liable to
Sellers for any such transfer or disposal. 

Section 5.13 Leases.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(but without any obligation to pay any money or other consideration) to
obtain and deliver to Buyers (i) estoppel certificates from each counterparty
under the Real Property Leases and Third Party Leases, substantially in the
form required by the applicable lease or, if no form is provided for, in a
form mutually agreeable to the Parties (each, a " _Lease Estoppel_ "), and
(ii) to the extent reasonably requested by Buyers, Subordination and Non-
Disturbance Agreements from third party landlords and their lenders with
respect to the Leased Real Properties, in a form mutually agreeable to the
Parties (each, an " _SNDA_ "). Lease Estoppels shall be dated no more than
thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Sellers shall be obligated for any amounts required by the terms of the Real
Property Leases to be paid by the signatories to the Lease Estoppels and
SNDAs.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if, despite
the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, any Seller is unable to
obtain any Lease Estoppel for any reason (including if Seller obtains a Lease
Estoppel from any tenant but reasonably believes any disclosure on such Lease
Estoppel is inaccurate), then Sellers shall deliver to Buyers an estoppel
certificate with respect to the applicable Real Property Lease or Third Party
Lease, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyers (each, a " _Seller Estoppel_
") and, in the case of any Seller Estoppel that Sellers deliver to Buyers due
to a reasonable belief that any disclosure on the Lease Estoppel received for
the applicable Station Property is inaccurate, Sellers shall inform Buyers of
such belief and issue. Delivery of a Seller Estoppel for a Station Property
shall not waive or limit any indemnification rights that any Buyer Indemnified
Party has pursuant to _Section 8.2_ in respect of any breach or violation of
or default under the applicable Real Property Lease or Third Party Lease;
_provided_ , _however_ that to the extent a Lease Estoppel is obtained and
delivered with respect to any Leased Real Property following the delivery of
the Seller Estoppel, such Seller Estoppel shall be of no further force or
effect for any purpose under this Agreement with respect to such Leased Real
Property.

 



70 (c) Subject to _Section 5.13(b)_ , (i) no Lease Estoppel will
be acceptable if it reflects any fact or circumstance that is not consistent
in all material respects with or reflected in this Agreement or any
representation or warranty by Sellers hereunder (including, without
limitation, in any Ancillary Agreements) and (ii) no Seller Estoppel will be
acceptable if it reflects any fact or circumstance that is not consistent in
all material respects with or reflected in this Agreement or any
representation or warranty by Sellers hereunder (including, without
limitation, in any Ancillary Agreements) (each such fact or circumstance
described in the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , an " _Objectionable
Disclosure_ ") or if it reflects or discloses any actual material uncured
breach or default by any Seller under a Real Property Lease or Third Party
Lease that has not previously been disclosed to Buyers. To the extent a Lease
Estoppel or Seller Estoppel discloses an actual or alleged breach or default
by a Seller under a Real Property Lease or Third Party Lease, Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to commence curing such matter, if and to
the extent curable, not later than delivery to Buyers of the applicable Lease
Estoppel or Seller Estoppel, and shall thereafter use commercially reasonable
efforts to complete such cure prior to the Closing. In the event Sellers fail
to cure such breach or default prior to the Closing as provided in the
preceding sentence, and/or in the event Buyers disapprove of any
Objectionable Disclosure disclosed by any Lease Estoppel or Seller Estoppel,
then, at Buyers option, exercisable by written notice to Sellers prior to the
consummation of the Closing, (A) the Purchase Price will be reduced by an
amount reasonably necessary to cure the applicable breach or default, such
amount to be mutually agreed upon in good faith by Buyers and Sellers, or (B)
Buyers may elect to proceed to the Closing without a reduction of the
Purchase Price and bring a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(d)_ for (1) the actual documented out-of-pocket Losses, if any, suffered,
sustained, incurred or required to be paid at any time from and after the
Closing by any Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent based upon, arising out
of, resulting from or because of such uncured breach or default, plus (2) the
Assigned Drop Value assigned to the applicable Station Property on _Schedule
2.7_ in the event the applicable Real Property Lease or Third Party Lease is
terminated following the Closing as a result of such uncured breach
or default.

Section 5.14 Additional Contracts and Assets; Shared Contracts and Assets.

(a) Subject to reasonable and customary precautions with respect to any
confidentiality obligation, within thirty (30) days after the Signing Date,
Sellers shall provide a true and complete written list (the " _Contracts List_
") of Contracts and true and complete copies of such Contracts, together with
all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto, to which a Seller is a
party that are related to the Business or the Assets other than those related
solely to a Rejected Property, including any Acquisition Non-Competition
Agreements. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Contracts List, with
respect to (i) any Contract on the Contract List that exclusively or primarily
relates to the Assets or the Business, Buyers shall notify Sellers in writing
identifying each such Contract that Buyers elect, in their sole discretion, to
designate as an Assumed Contract subject to the procedures set forth in
_Section 5.14(c)_ , and (ii) with respect to each other Contract on the
Contracts List, Buyers shall notify Sellers in writing identifying each such
Contract that Buyers elect, in their sole discretion, to designate as a Shared
Contract subject to the procedures set forth in  _Section 5.14(d)_. In the
event Buyers do not designate a

 



71  Contract on the Contracts List as either an Assumed Contract pursuant to
_clause (i)_ of the immediately preceding sentence or a Shared Contract,
pursuant to _clause (ii)_ of the immediately preceding sentence, then such
Contract shall be an Excluded Asset and Sellers shall retain such Contract and
have no further obligations to Buyers with respect to such Contract under this
_Section 5.14_.

 

(b) Subject to reasonable and customary precautions with respect to any
confidentiality obligation, at least twenty (20) days prior to Closing,
Sellers shall provide an updated Contracts List that contains any Contracts
entered into between the Signing Date and the date of such updated Contracts
List and true and complete copies of such Contracts, together with all
amendments, modifications and supplements thereto. Within ten (10) days after
receipt of the updated Contracts List, with respect to (i) any new Contract on
the updated Contracts List that exclusively or primarily relates to
the Assets or the Business, Buyers shall notify Sellers in writing
identifying each such Contract that Buyers elect, in their sole discretion, to
designate as an Assumed Contract subject to the procedures set forth in
_Section 5.14(c)_ , and (ii) with respect to each other new Contract on the
updated Contracts List, Buyers shall notify Sellers in writing identifying
each such Contract that Buyers elect, in their sole discretion, to designate
as subject to the procedures set forth in _Section 5.14(d)_. In the event
Buyers do not designate a Contract on the Contracts List as either an Assumed
Contract pursuant to _clause (i)_ of the immediately preceding sentence or a
Shared Contract, pursuant to  _clause (ii)_ of the immediately preceding
sentence, then such Contract shall be an Excluded Asset and Sellers shall
retain such Contract and have no further obligations to Buyers with respect to
such Contract under this  _Section 5.14_.

(c) Subject to the remainder of this _Section 5.14(c)_ , any Contract
designated by Buyers to be an Assumed Contract pursuant to _Section 5.14(a)_
or _Section 5.14(b)_ shall be automatically added to _Schedule 1.1(ii)_ as an
Assumed Contracts for all purposes under this Agreement. If any Contract
designated by Buyers to be an Assumed Contract is a Shared Contract, Sellers
shall (i) if such Contract permits assignment in part, assign only the
relevant portion in part to Buyers, in which case only the assigned portion
shall be added to  _Schedule 1.1(ii)_ as an Assumed Contract and be an
Assumed Contract for all purposes under this Agreement and (ii) if such
Contract does not permit assignment in part, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Contract to be amended, or obtain a consent from the
Contract counterparty(ies) permitting, assignment in part to Buyers. If such
Contract does not permit assignment in part and Sellers are not able to cause
such Contract to be amended or obtain a consent permitting assignment in part
to Buyers, then Buyers shall take such other reasonable and permissible
actions (including entering into a subcontracting arrangement) to provide the
rights and benefits of such Contract to Sellers from and after the Closing.

(d) With respect to any Contract designated by Buyers to be a Shared
Contract, Sellers shall (i) if such Contract permits assignment in part,
assign only the relevant portion in part to Buyers, in which case only the
assigned portion shall be added to _Schedule 1.1(ii)_ as an Assumed Contract
and be an Assumed Contract for all purposes under this Agreement, (ii) if
such Contract does not permit assignment in part, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Contract to be amended, or obtain a consent from the
Contract counterparty(ies) permitting, assignment in part to Buyers or (iii)
if such Contract does not permit assignment in part and Sellers are not able
to cause such Contract to be amended or obtain a consent permitting assignment
in part to Buyers, take such other reasonable and permissible
actions (including entering into a subcontracting arrangement) to provide the
rights and benefits of such Contract to Buyers from and after the Closing.

 



72 (e) Within thirty (30) days after the Signing Date, Sellers shall provide
a true and complete written list of (i) any assets used or held for use in the
Business that do not otherwise constitute Assets (" _Shared Assets_ ") and
(ii) the Assets (the " _Assets List_ "). Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Assets List, Buyers shall (i) notify Sellers of any Assets
which Buyers elect, in their sole discretion, to designate as Excluded Assets
and (ii) notify Sellers of any Shared Assets that Buyers request, in their
sole discretion, to designate as Assets, subject to the following sentence.
With respect to the Shared Assets requested to be designated as Assets in
accordance with this _Section 5.14(d)_ , (i) if such Shared Asset is
divisible, Sellers shall divide such Shared Asset and convey the portion of
the Shared Asset related to the Business to Buyers at the Closing while
retaining the portion of the Shared Asset not related to the Business
(which shall be deemed an Excluded Asset for all purposes under this
Agreement), (ii) if such Shared Asset is not divisible, Sellers shall take
such other reasonable and permissible actions to provide the rights and
benefits of such Shared Asset to Buyers, and such Shared Asset shall be
retained by Sellers and shall not be considered an Asset for any purpose under
this Agreement. Any Asset designated by Buyers to be an Excluded Asset shall
be automatically added to _Schedule 2.2(e)_ as an Excluded Asset for all
purposes under this Agreement.

(f) With respect to the CMF 24-Hour Monitoring, between the Signing Date
and the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide reasonable access and information
to Buyers concerning CMF 24-Hour Monitoring. Buyers may elect to move the CMF
24-Hour Monitoring from an Asset to an Excluded Asset prior to Closing. To the
extent that certain Excluded Assets utilize the CMF 24-Hour Monitoring and
Buyers retain the CMF 24-Hour Monitoring as an Asset, Buyers shall take such
other reasonable and permissible actions to provide at cost the rights and
benefits of the CMF 24-Hour Monitoring to Sellers.

(g) With respect to any Acquisition Non-Competition Agreements that are
not able to be assigned to Buyers, Sellers shall, at Buyers sole cost and
expense, enforce the terms and provisions of such Acquisition Non-Competition
Agreements against the counterparty(ies) thereto.

 

Section 5.15 Non-Solicitation. From the Signing Date until the earlier of
the Closing Date and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly

otherwise), or any inquiry or contact with any Person with respect to an
Alternative Proposal, such notice to include the identity of the Person
proposing such Alternative Proposal and the material terms thereof (and, if
such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact is in writing, a copy thereof). For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyers and any
Affiliates thereof) to purchase or otherwise acquire, in a single transaction
or series of related transactions, any Asset (other than Inventory or

outstanding equity securities, whether effected in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions.

 

Section 5.16 Notice; Supplemental Disclosures. Until the Closing, Sellers
shall promptly disclose to Buyers upon becoming aware of any representation,
warranty or covenant by Sellers contained in this Agreement being or becoming
untrue or inaccurate; _provided_ , _however_ , that such disclosure or any
matter required to be disclosed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_
(whether or not actually disclosed) shall (i) be deemed not to cure any breach
of a representation or warranty or to satisfy any condition for purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have
been satisfied and (ii) not be subject to the limitations contained in
_Section 8.4(a)_.

 

Section 5.17 Assets and Assumed Liabilities Held by Seller Subsidiaries.
If, at any time following the Signing Date and prior to the Closing, Sellers
become aware that any Assets or Assumed Liabilities are held by one or more
Subsidiaries of any Seller, then the applicable Seller or Sellers shall cause
such Subsidiary or Subsidiaries holding such Assets or Assumed Liabilities to
become a party to this Agreement as a Seller, by executing a joinder hereto in
a form reasonably acceptable to Buyers.

 

Section 5.18 Seller Rejected Properties. At any time prior to the
Closing, Sellers may, in their sole discretion by written notice to Buyers,
elect to designate any Station Property set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 5.18_ as
a Rejected Property and reduce the Purchase Price by the Assigned Drop Value
assigned to such Station Property on _Schedule_ __ _ 2.7_; _provided_ that
any Covered Transaction Expenses related to such Rejected Property shall be
deducted from Excess Covered Transaction Expenses.

 

Section 5.19 Prospective Leases. As promptly as practical and prior to the
Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyers
in entering into the lease described on _Schedule_ __ _ 5.19_ on terms
acceptable to Buyers, including by keeping Buyers reasonably informed
regarding any material activities with respect thereto and providing Buyers
with reasonable notice of and an opportunity to participate in any meetings
with a counterparty with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , (a) Sellers
shall not be obligated to make any payment to any third party to induce them
to enter into any such lease and (b) Sellers shall have no obligation to enter
into any such lease.

 



74 Section 5.20 Ancillary Agreements. Sellers and Buyers shall, and shall
cause their applicable Affiliates to, negotiate in good faith to prepare and
finalize (a) execution forms of the Escrow Agreement, APlus License Agreement,
LTC License Agreement, Stripes License Agreement, Transportation Services
Agreement, Supply Agreement and Transition Services and Operations Agreement
(it being understood that the Supply Agreement shall reflect the terms
described on _Exhibit C_ together with other terms and conditions that are
mutually agreeable to Sellers and Buyers), and (b) a definitive version of the
Agreed Inventory Procedures, a preliminary draft of which is set forth as
_Exhibit A_ , in each case in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyers and
Sellers on or prior to the date that is forty-five (45) days immediately
following the Signing Date.

 

Section 5.21 Indenture Measures.

 

(a) Sunoco LP and Sunoco Finance (collectively, the " _Issuers_ ") shall,
and shall cause the guarantors under the Note Indentures (the " _Notes
Guarantors_ ") to, either (i) on the Closing Date satisfy and discharge the
Note Indentures in accordance with the terms thereof (including the
satisfaction of any conditions precedent required in order to effect
satisfaction and discharge of the Note Indentures pursuant to the terms of the
Note Indentures, the " _Satisfaction and Discharge_ ") or (ii) commence on or
after the date hereof and consummate on or prior to the Closing Date a
consent solicitation (the " _Consent Solicitation_ ") pursuant to which
supplemental indentures are to be approved, executed and delivered, which
supplemental indentures amend the Note Indentures and the Notes to modify,
delete or waive the change of control covenants, the merger covenants, and any
other provision in the Note Indentures or the Notes that could be breached by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the Ancillary
Agreements or that would require the Buyers to assume or become liable for or
in respect of any of the Notes or any other obligations in connection with the
Note Indentures in such a way as to prevent, in the good faith judgment of
the Issuers, any such breach, assumption or liability (collectively, the "
_Target Provisions_ "). The Satisfaction and Discharge (including the sending
of a notice of redemption of with respect to the Notes as a condition
precedent thereto) and the Consent Solicitation are collectively referred to
herein as the " _Indenture Measures_." The Issuers shall provide, and shall
cause the Notes Guarantors to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested
by the Buyers in connection with the Indenture Measures. Such cooperation
shall include (i) if applicable, engagement of a solicitation agent and an
information agent with respect to the Consent Solicitation, (ii) the delivery
by the Issuers of officers certificates and legal opinions required under the
Notes and the Note Indentures, (iii) execution and delivery of supplemental
indentures pursuant to the Consent Solicitation, and (iv) using commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the trustees under the Note Indentures to execute
supplemental indentures, satisfaction and discharge documents, and notices of
redemption, as applicable.

 

(b) The Issuers obligations to make any payment with respect to the
Consent Solicitation and any notices of redemption in connection with the
Satisfaction and Discharge may be subject to one or more conditions reasonably
acceptable to the Buyers, including the contemporaneous consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent necessary, the Guarantors
shall provide (or cause to be provided) sufficient immediately available funds
to the Issuers to make all payments required by the Indenture Measures. The
Indenture Measures and other actions taken in connection therewith shall
be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Note Indentures and all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and other applicable Laws.

 



75 (c) The Issuers shall, and shall cause the Note Guarantors to, waive
any of the conditions to the Indenture Measures as may be reasonably
requested by Buyers (other than the conditions that payment with respect to
the Consent Solicitation and the Satisfaction and Discharge be conditioned on
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and that there shall
be no Law prohibiting consummation of the Indenture Measures), if such waivers
would not cause the Indenture Measures to violate the Note Indentures, the
Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or any other
applicable Law. Without the prior consent of Buyers, the Issuers shall not,
and shall not permit any Note Guarantors to, waive any condition to the
Indenture Measures or make any change, amendment or modification to the terms
and conditions of the Indenture Measures (including any extension thereof),
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or as otherwise required to
comply with applicable Law.

 

(d) The Issuers shall (i) until the Consent Solicitation has been
consummated and the supplemental indentures with respect thereto have been
executed and have become effective, prepare, in consultation with Buyers, as
promptly as practicable all agreements, documents, instruments and other
writings necessary or advisable in respect thereof, and (ii) to the extent
pursuing a Consent Solicitation, may prepare a consent solicitation statement,
forms of supplemental indentures, officers certificates and legal opinions in
connection therewith, and all other agreements, documents, instruments
and other writings necessary or advisable in respect of the Consent
Solicitation (such writings, together with the writings necessary or advisable
in respect of the Satisfaction and Discharge, together with all supplements
and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "
_Indenture Documents_ "). The Issuers shall, and shall cause the Note
Guarantors to, (i) reasonably cooperate with Buyers in the preparation of the
Indenture Documents and (ii) unless and until the Consent Solicitation has
been consummated, in good faith pursue all actions required to consummate the
Satisfaction and Discharge. The Indenture Documents shall be subject to the
prior review of, and comment by, Buyers, and shall be reasonably acceptable
to Buyers, but Buyers shall have no obligation with respect to the Indenture
Documents, including no obligation to deliver, or cause to be delivered, any
Indenture Documents.

 

Section 5.22 Delivery of Disclosure Schedules; Effects on Transaction.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within fifteen (15)
calendar days after the Signing Date, Sellers shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Buyers (i) a full and complete set of Sellers Disclosure
Schedules to the Agreement (including, subject to reasonable and customary
precautions to comply with confidentiality obligations and applicable Law,
copies of all agreements, documents, correspondence or other information
referenced therein to the extent not previously provided) and (ii) a
certificate executed by an authorized officer of Sellers certifying that
such Disclosure Schedules are full and complete and, subject to reasonable
and customary precautions to comply with confidentiality obligations and
applicable Law, all agreements, documents, correspondence or other information
referenced therein have been provided to Buyers as of such date; provided
that Sellers shall not make any changes or updates to the Sellers Disclosure
Schedules pursuant to this _Section 5.22 (A)_ to Schedules called for by any
Article of this Agreement, other than _Articles I_ , _III_ and _Schedules
2.2(b)_ , _2.2(e)_ , _2.2(p)_ ,

 



76   _5.5(c)_ , _5.9(b)_ , _5.9(c)_ , _5.11(c)(iii)_ , _6.9_ , _6.14(a)_ and
_6.14(b)_ , (B) to _Schedule 1.1(viii)_ , (C) for any events, circumstances or
occurrences after the Signing Date, and (D) without the consent of Buyers, to
expand the scope of Assumed Liabilities or to limit the scope of the Assets.
For the avoidance of doubt, _Schedule 1.1(ii)_ (Assumed Contracts), _Schedule
1.1(xii)_  (Title Policy), _Schedule 2.7_ (Assigned Drop Value), _Schedule
4.3_ (No Violation; Third Party Consents), _Schedule 5.5(b)(i)_ (Fuel
Equipment Inspections and Repairs) and _Schedule 5.11(a)_ (Restricted Areas)
do not constitute Sellers Disclosure Schedules, and Sellers shall have no
right to revise them.

(b) Buyers shall have thirty (30) calendar days following the date on
which Buyers receive a full and complete set of Sellers Disclosure Schedules
to the Agreement (including, subject to reasonable and customary precautions
to comply with confidentiality obligations and applicable Law, copies of all
agreements, documents, correspondence or other information referenced therein
to the extent not previously provided) to review and analyze such information
(such period, the " _Review Period_ "). During the Review Period, Sellers
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, (i) cooperate with
and make available to Buyers and their Representatives all information and
(ii) shall permit Buyers and their Representatives access to its facilities,
personnel and outside advisors, in each case, as may be reasonably requested
by Buyers in connection with their review of such information and in a
commercially reasonable manner (it being understood that the Review
Period shall not toll during any period during which Sellers are not
complying with their obligations in this sentence). The Sellers Disclosure
Schedules and any matters disclosed therein or in any document or information
supporting or underlying the Sellers Disclosure Schedules (whether disclosed
in the Sellers Disclosure Schedules as of the Signing Date or in Sellers
Disclosure Schedules delivered pursuant to clause (a) above), but excluding 
_Schedule 1.1(viii)_, _1.1(xvii)_ , _1.1(xviii)_ , _1.1(xxi)_ , _2.9(a)(i)_ ,
_2.9(a)(ii)_ , _5.15_ , _5.18_ and _5.19_ and the matters set forth thereon,
are collectively referred to as the " _Disclosure Matters_ _._ "

(c) If Buyers reasonably determine that (i) any of the representations or
warranties of Sellers set forth in this Agreement are not true and correct
(disregarding any Material Adverse Effect, materiality or similar qualifier)
as a result of or in connection with the Disclosure Matters, and the
failures to be so true and correct (when aggregated together with all other
failures of the representations or warranties of Sellers set forth in this
Agreement to be so true and correct as a result of or in connection with the
Disclosure Matters), (ii) any terms, conditions or restrictions of any Real
Property Lease provided by Sellers to Buyers deviate from the summary of such
terms, conditions or restrictions provided to Buyers by Sellers prior to the
Signing Date in a manner that would (or to the extent a summary of any such
terms, conditions or restrictions were not provided to Buyers to Sellers prior
to the Signing Date, otherwise would) or (iii) any of the other matters set
forth in the Disclosure Matters that are not scheduled as exceptions to any
of the representations or warranties of Sellers set forth in this Agreement,
would, in each case, result, or would reasonably be expected to result, in
Losses or otherwise have an objectively identifiable adverse impact to
the Business, the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or Buyers ability to own
or operate the Business or the Assets after Closing (calculated in accordance
with _Section 8.4(d)_ ) (such event, a " _Objection Trigger_ ") then Buyers
may deliver to Sellers written notice to that effect (the " _Objection Notice_
") at any time on or prior to the end of the fifth (5th) Business Day after
the end of the Review Period. The Objection Notice shall specify the
Disclosure Matters that result in or that would reasonably be expected to

 



77  result in such Losses, together with Buyers calculation of expected Losses
(each, an " _Objectionable Disclosure Matter_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ¸
that Buyers shall not be permitted to include as an Objectionable Disclosure
Matter any specific individual Disclosure Matter that (i) Buyers and Sellers
agree in writing is an Excluded Liability, (ii) would result in Buyers having
a right to designate a Station Property as a Rejected Property pursuant to
_Section 5.5(d)_ , _Section 5.6(a)_ , _Section 5.6(c)_ , _Section 5.6(e)_ ,
_Section 5.9(a)_ , _Section 5.9(b)_ , _Section 5.9(c)_ , _Section 6.8(b)_
, or _Section 6.9_ or (iii) would result in Buyers having a right to receive
an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)_ , _Section
5.6(c)_ , _Section 5.13(c)_ , _Section 6.8(b)_ ,  _Section 6.9_, _Section
6.11_ or _Section 6.14_; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt, none of the Disclosure Matters contemplated by the preceding clauses
(ii) and (iii), and their inclusion in the applicable Sellers Disclosure
Schedules, shall have any effect on Buyers rights set forth in _Section
5.5_, _Section 5.6_, _Section 5.9_, _Section 5.13_, _Section 6.8_, 
_Section 6.9_, _Section 6.11_ and _Section 6.14_, including Buyers ability
to designate any Station Property a Rejected Property or recover any
adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by the sections specified in
clauses (ii) and (iii).

(d) With respect to any Disclosure Matters which are not included
as Objectionable Disclosure Matters in an Objection Notice, such Disclosure
Matters shall, five (5) days following the completion of the Review Period,
automatically become part of the disclosure schedules to this Agreement for
all purposes and shall be deemed to qualify the representations and
warranties to which they relate, if any. If Buyers deliver an Objection Notice
to Sellers in accordance with clause (c) above, then Buyers and Sellers shall
negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve the impact of each of the
Objectionable Disclosure Matters for ten (10) days following the date on which
Buyers delivered such notice (such period, the " _Resolution Period_ ").
Sellers or Buyers may, but shall not be obligated to, propose to Buyers or
Sellers, respectively a method of resolving any Disputed Disclosure Matter (a
" _Proposed Resolution_ "). At the conclusion of the Resolution Period, to
the extent Buyers and Sellers have agreed with respect to a Proposed
Resolution to any Objectionable Disclosure Matter or otherwise mutually agreed
that the Objectionable Disclosure Matter is no longer an Objectionable
Disclosure Matter, then the parties shall amend this Agreement to reflect any
such agreements.

(e) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Buyers or Sellers
continue to be in dispute as to any Objectionable Disclosure Matters, then
Buyers and Sellers, jointly, shall engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such
outstanding dispute. As promptly as practicable thereafter (and, in any event,
within five (5) days after the Arbitration Firms engagement) and subject to
the limitations described above, Sellers and Buyers shall submit any
unresolved elements of their dispute to the Arbitration Firm in writing (with
a copy to Buyers or Sellers, respectively), supported by any documents upon
which it relies. Buyers and Sellers shall direct the Arbitration Firm to
choose either Buyers position in its entirety or Sellers position in its
entirety based solely on the submissions by Buyers and Sellers, and request
that the Arbitration Firm render its determination within fifteen (15) days
following receipt of the submissions from Sellers and Buyers. Neither Sellers
nor Buyers nor any of their respective Representatives shall have any _ex
parte_ conversations or meetings with the Arbitration Firm without the prior
written consent of the other party, as applicable (other than with respect to
ministerial matters similar to matters that would be discussed with a clerk
of a court). The party whose position is not chosen by the Arbitration Firm
shall be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the Arbitration Firm.
Absent fraud or manifest error, all determinations made by the Arbitration
Firm will be final,

 



78  conclusive and binding on the parties and, absent fraud or manifest error,
no party shall be entitled to appeal such determination or bring any
additional Proceeding, pursuant to this Section 5.22 or otherwise, with
respect to any of the specific individual matters that were the subject of
such determination. In the event the Arbitration Firm determines that, after
taking into account any Proposed Resolutions, the Objectionable Disclosure
Matters would reasonably be expected to result in unrecoverable Losses to
Buyers or otherwise have an objectively identifiable adverse impact to the
Business, the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or Buyers ability to own or
operate the Business or the Assets after Closing (the " _Determined Losses_
"), in excess of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) (calculated in accordance
with _Section 8.4(d)_ ), then Buyers will have the option to either (i)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_ or (ii) reduce the Base
Price by the aggregate amount by which such Determined Losses exceed Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000). In the event the Arbitration
Firm determines that, after taking into account any Proposed Resolutions, the
Objectionable Disclosure Matters would reasonably be expected to result in
Determined Losses with an aggregate value in excess of Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000) but less than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), then
the Base Price shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such Losses that
exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

 

(f) Following the resolution of any arbitration contemplated by _Section
5.22(e)_ , any Objectionable Disclosure Matters shall automatically become
part of the disclosure schedules to this Agreement for all purposes and shall
be deemed to qualify the representations and warranties to which they relate,
if any. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recovery for
any Losses with respect to Determined Losses for any specific individual
matter to the extent of the amount of any adjustment to the Base Price
pursuant to this _Section 5.22_, including through any adjustment to the
Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 2.9_ or pursuant to _Article VIII_
hereof, it being the attention of the parties to avoid "double dipping" with
respect to the payment of any such Determined Losses.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

 

Section 6.1 Agreements Related to Environmental Matters.

 

(a) _By Sellers with Respect to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities_. 

(i) _Generally_. From and after Closing, with respect to any Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities, Sellers shall conduct, at their sole cost and
expense, any Remediation Activities required under Environmental Law or as
directed by the appropriate Governmental Entity, until such time as Sellers
obtain NFA Status. In addition, Sellers shall ensure proper closure of any
groundwater or other monitoring wells, remove all metal rings and restore the
condition of each Station Property to proper grade. In connection with such
activities by Sellers or their Representatives, (A) Buyers shall provide
Sellers with non-exclusive access to the Station Properties as necessary to
remediate any Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities, and, as applicable,
Buyers shall execute and deliver to Sellers a Site Access Agreement in a form
mutually and reasonably agreeable to the Parties (the " _Site
Access Agreement_ ") for each such Station

 



79  Property; (B) Sellers shall have the right to use the Station Properties as
is reasonably necessary to conduct such Remediation Activities in accordance
with the Site Access Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
activities are completed in a good and workmanlike manner with due diligence,
in compliance with applicable Laws, and do not unreasonably interfere with or
unreasonably disturb Buyers operations; (C) Buyers shall cooperate in good
faith with Sellers to complete any Remediation Activities related to the Pre-
Closing Environmental Liabilities; and (D) such Remediation Activities shall
be subject to the following requirements:

(1) Sellers shall coordinate the schedule of any remediation with Buyers
in advance;

(2) Unless required by a Governmental Entity, Sellers shall not agree to
elect any remediation that imposes any obligations, including any out-of-
pocket costs or expenses, on any Buyer without such Buyers prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; and

(3) Sellers shall provide Buyers with copies of documents prepared in
connection with the remediation of any Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities,
including all correspondence with the applicable Governmental Entity.

 

(ii) _Environmental Liabilities Identified During Post-Closing Inspection
and Repair Activities_. In the event that the Post-Closing Inspection and
Repair Activities identify an Environmental Liability, such Environmental
Liability shall be deemed a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability and shall
be addressed in accordance with _Section 6.1(a)(i)_.

(iii) _Limitations on Buyers_. Following the Closing Date and until the
Environmental Liability Presumption Change Date, Buyers expressly acknowledge
and agree (A) that Buyers shall not voluntarily undertake any invasive
sampling or testing activities at the Station Properties other than as
permitted in the proviso below and (B) that in no event shall any
Environmental Liability identified by such voluntary invasive sampling or
testing activities specified in _clause (A)_ during this period be presumed
to be a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyers shall be permitted to conduct Phase II ESAs or other invasive sampling
or testing activities (1) at the request of any potential purchaser of any
Real Property or any financing source or landlord of Buyers; provided such
request is normal or customary, (2) in connection with the repair, replacement
or upgrade of any Fuel Equipment, (3) reasonably necessary in connection with
any construction activities undertaken for a legitimate business purpose (it
being understood that the purpose of such construction must be separate and
distinct from any business purpose related to managing or minimizing
Environmental Liabilities), (4) undertaken solely for any other legitimate
business purpose acting in the manner consistent with Buyers past practices
(it being understood that such business purpose must be separate and distinct
from any business purpose related to managing or minimizing Environmental
Liabilities), (5) as a result of any Order by a Governmental Entity that is
not discovered as a result of the voluntary invasive sampling or testing
activities set forth in _clause (A)_ or as required by Law, or (6) as a
result of any third party

 



80  claim relating to any potential Environmental Liability that is not
discovered as a result of the voluntary invasive sampling or testing
activities set forth in _clause (A)_ (Environmental Liability discovered
from the activities identified in the foregoing proviso, " _Ordinary Course
Environmental Liability_ ").

 

(iv) _Presumption of Environmental Liability_. Any Ordinary Course
Environmental Liability shall be subject to a presumption that such Ordinary
Course Environmental Liability is a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability, so
long as it is identified prior to the Environmental Liability Presumption
Change Date. If Sellers are able to demonstrate by clear and convincing
evidence that such Ordinary Course Environmental Liability first arose or
occurred following the Closing Date, the presumption provided for in the
foregoing sentence shall be overcome and such Ordinary Course Environmental
Liability shall be deemed a Post-Closing Environmental Liability. If Sellers
are unable to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that any Ordinary
Course Environmental Liability first arose or occurred following the Closing
Date, then such Ordinary Course Environmental Liability shall be deemed to be
a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability. Any Ordinary Course Environmental
Liability identified by Buyers after the Environmental Liability Presumption
Change Date shall be subject to a presumption that such Ordinary Course
Environmental Liability is a Post-Closing Environmental Liability. If Buyers
are able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such Ordinary
Course Environmental Liability first arose or occurred on or prior to the
Closing Date, the presumption provided for in the foregoing sentence shall be
overcome and such Ordinary Course Environmental Liability shall be deemed a
Pre-Closing Environmental Liability. If Buyers are unable to demonstrate by
clear and convincing evidence that any Ordinary Course Environmental Liability
first arose or occurred on or prior to the Closing Date, then such Ordinary
Course Environmental Liability shall be deemed to be a Post-Closing
Environmental Liability.

 

(v) _Assumed Environmental Liabilities_. On the Environmental Liability
Assumption Date, Buyers shall assume and agree to pay, perform and discharge
when due in accordance with their respective terms without recourse to Sellers
all Environmental Liabilities at, on or under the Station Properties other
than (A) any Environmental Liabilities arising out of or related to MTBE,
lead or chromium and any constituents or by-products of such substances, (B)
with respect to any Station Property that has received NFA or similar
approval status from a Governmental Entity or licensed
remediation/environmental professional with authority over such matter, any
Environmental Liabilities arising from the reopening, revocation or rescission
of such NFA or similar approval, (C) any Remediation Activities for which
Sellers are responsible and for which NFA Status has not been obtained and (D)
any third party claims with respect to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities
(which the Parties agree shall not include any Third Party Claims by a
Governmental Entity to remediate Environmental Liabilities) (collectively, the
" _Assumed Environmental Liabilities_ ").

 

(vi) _Apportionment of Environmental Liabilities_. In the event that
Sellers and Buyers both have responsibility to investigate, assess, remove,
remediate and/or monitor the same Environmental Liability, such Environmental
Liability will be apportioned between Sellers and Buyers in proportion to the
extent to which the 

 



81  Contamination for which Sellers are responsible and the Contamination for
which Buyers are responsible contributed to the Environmental Liability,
taking into account all pertinent factors giving rise to the Environmental
Liability.

(b) _By Buyers with Respect to Post-Closing Environmental
Liabilities_. From and after Closing, Buyers shall be solely responsible, at
no expense to any Seller, for any and all Post-Closing Environmental
Liabilities. In no event shall Sellers have any Liability for costs of
remediation of any Post-Closing Environmental Liabilities.

(c) _Engineering and Institutional Controls_. Buyers and Sellers
acknowledge that the Real Property is and will be subject to Engineering and
Institutional Controls imposed in connection with previous, ongoing and future
remedial activities taken or required pursuant to Environmental Law at the
Real Property, including, as specifically set forth in the Special Warranty
Deeds and any deeds in the chain of title for a Station Property that contain
Engineering and Institutional Controls. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve NFA Status in a manner
that minimizes the need for Engineering and Institutional Controls and Sellers
shall maintain compliance with all Engineering and Institutional Controls,
including consent orders, administrative orders and similar documents; 
_provided_ that Buyers shall maintain, at Buyers cost and expense, already
existing grass caps and impervious barriers such as concrete or asphalt.

 

(d) _Underground Storage Tanks_. The Parties acknowledge that, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Station Properties are being
sold to Buyers with USTs in place and accordingly agree as follows:

 

(i) Sellers shall provide all relevant and necessary information about the
USTs, including information regarding the age and condition of the USTs, all
prior reported incidents involving the USTs (if any) and all information
regarding registration of the USTs with appropriate authorities. Such
information has been or will be provided solely for Buyers use and may not
be relied upon by any third party.

(ii) In accordance with applicable Laws, Buyers shall obtain all Permits
that are required by any applicable Governmental Entity or standards
(including all Environmental Laws) to own and operate all USTs at the Station
Properties. Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate and take all commercially
reasonable steps to ensure that the records of the applicable Governmental
Entities show the applicable Buyer as the owner and operator of the USTs from
and after the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent
possible, Sellers and Buyers each covenant to deliver by the date that is
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date all necessary tank registration forms
and other documentation in each case to the extent required by applicable
Governmental Entities to transfer ownership of the USTs to the applicable
Buyer (the " _Tank Owner Change Forms_ ") as of the Closing Date.

 



82 Section 6.2 Tax Matters.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Sellers shall file all Tax Returns with respect to
Transfer Taxes, and Buyers shall provide commercially reasonable assistance
in connection with such filings. Transfer Taxes shall be borne and timely paid
by Buyers or Sellers, as applicable, in accordance with _Section 9.4(b)_.
Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

(b) _Property Taxes_.

(i) Sellers shall be allocated and bear all Property Taxes attributable to
(A) any Tax period ending prior to the Closing Date and (B) the portion of
any Straddle Period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Buyers shall bear and be allocated all Property Taxes attributable to (A) any
Tax period beginning on or after the Closing Date and (B) the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning on the Closing Date. The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted at the Closing Date by the amount of unpaid Property Taxes allocable
to Buyers and Sellers, as applicable. To the extent the actual amount of
Property Taxes is not determinable at the Closing Date, Buyers and Sellers
shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section 2.5_. Upon
determination of the actual amount of Property Taxes, Sellers shall pay to
Buyers any additional amount necessary to equal Sellers share of the Property
Taxes; in the event the amount paid by Sellers at the Closing Date exceeds
Sellers share of Property Taxes, Buyers shall refund any such overage to
Sellers.

 

(ii) For purposes of determining the allocations described in clause (i)
above, Property Taxes shall be prorated between Sellers and Buyers based on
their relative number of days of ownership of the Assets during the Straddle
Period. Sellers portion shall be determined by multiplying the total amount
of such Property Taxes imposed for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle
Period which ends one (1) day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the entire Straddle
Period; and Buyers portion shall be determined by subtracting Sellers
portion (as determined in accordance with preceding clause of this sentence)
from the total amount of such Property Taxes imposed for the entire Straddle
Period.

(c) _Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation, or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes
relating to the Business and the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
under this Agreement. Sellers and Buyers agree to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations of the respective Taxable periods and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity. Sellers and
Buyers further agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide certificates or forms that are necessary or appropriate to establish
an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax.

 



83 Section 6.3 Bulk Transfer Laws. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
be responsible for, the requirements and provisions of all applicable bulk
sale, bulk transfer or similar Laws in all applicable jurisdictions in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers
shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties (as defined below) for any
Losses that any Buyer Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly, suffers,
sustains, becomes subject to or incurs as a result of, arising from or
relating to failure to comply with such laws.

Section 6.4 Employee Matters.

 

(a) _Employees_. Buyers shall, and may cause their Affiliates, to evaluate
in good faith with a desire to hire, a significant number of employees of
each Seller or its Affiliates who are store-level employees of Sellers and
their Affiliates employed at the Station Properties and the area managers
dedicated to supporting the Station Properties (the " _Station Operation
Employees_ "). In addition, Sellers shall provide to Buyers a list of certain
employees of Sellers and their Affiliates employed as of the Signing Date and
who provide services in connection with one or more of the Station
Properties, but whose principal place of employment is not at a Station
Property (the " _Non-Operation Support Employees_"). Such list of Non-
Operation Support Employees shall be provided as _Section 6.4_ and will
provide categories of such employees indicating their areas of functional
responsibilities. Seller will provide an update to _Section 6.4_ to reflect
any changes in the employee population approximately thirty (30) days prior to
the Closing Date. At any time prior to Closing, Buyers may, or may cause their
Affiliates to, in their sole discretion, offer employment to any Station
Operation Employee or Non-Operation Support Employee on terms and conditions,
including with respect to base compensation or hourly rate, consistent with
terms offered to similarly situated employees of Buyers. All of the Station
Operation Employees or Non-Operation Support Employees who are offered,
accept, and then commence employment with either Buyer after the Closing Date
are hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Buyer Employees_ " and each
individually is referred to as a " _Buyer Employee_." Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall, after the Closing, impose on any
Buyer or any of their Affiliates any obligation to retain any Buyer Employee
in their employment. Except as otherwise required by Law, specified in this
Agreement, or otherwise agreed in writing by Buyers, neither Buyer nor any
of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to provide any severance,
separation pay, or other payments or benefits, including any key employee
retention payments, to any Station Operation Employee or Non-Operation
Support Employee on account of any termination of such employees employment
on or before the Closing Date, and such benefits (if any) shall remain
obligations of Sellers.

 

(b) _Employee Benefits_. Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each Buyer Employee (i) to be credited under any employee benefit
plan of Buyers or their Affiliates under which the Buyer Employee becomes
covered for his or her period of employment with Sellers and their Affiliates
and predecessors before the Closing, if later, as if the Buyer Employee were
so employed by the applicable Buyer for all purposes for which such service
was recognized by Sellers and the Business or their respective Affiliates and
predecessors, except for service for benefit accrual purposes under
any defined benefit plan of Buyers and except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits; (ii) to be eligible to participate in all
employee benefit plans, including but not limited to all health and welfare
plans and any applicable severance plans, maintained by Buyers and generally
available

 



84  to employees of Buyers on the same terms and conditions as employees of
Buyers as of the Closing Date, without waiting periods or exclusions or
limitations for pre-existing conditions; and (iii) along with his or her
eligible dependents, as applicable, to be credited under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Buyers and covering such Buyer Employee after the Closing
for any deductible or coinsurance amounts paid by such Buyer Employee (or his
or her eligible dependents) under any corresponding Benefit Plan during the
plan year which includes the Closing Date, if later.

 

(c) _Vacation_. No later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date,
Seller or Sellers Affiliates shall pay in a lump sum to each Buyer Employee
the value, based on such employees base compensation, the 2017 earned or 2016
carried over but unused vacation accrued by such Buyer Employee. Upon
commencement of employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, each Buyer
Employee shall begin accruing vacation in accordance with Buyers or an
Affiliate of Buyers vacation policies.

 

(d) _Communications to Employees_. Prior to making any written or oral
communications to the employees of Sellers, pertaining to their employment,
termination, compensation, benefits, or other terms and conditions of
employment that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Sellers shall provide Buyer with a copy of the
intended communication. Buyer shall notify Sellers which employees of Sellers
employed at or providing services to the Station Properties it intends to make
offers of employment to prior to Closing. Buyers shall be entitled to meet
with and interview Employees in accordance with Section 5.1 in connection
with offers of employment as described in this Section 6.4(d) or other matters
described in Section 5.1; provided, however, that Buyers shall not approach,
contact or involve itself in any discussions or negotiations with any
employee of any Seller or with any other occupant of such Station Property,
without Sellers prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and, at Sellers option, without Sellers
(or Sellers designated representative) being present thereat.

(e) _Benefit Plans_. Buyers shall not assume any Liabilities or
responsibilities relating to any Benefit Plan or to the Benefit Plans
generally sponsored by Seller or Sellers Affiliates, and Sellers and their
Affiliates, as applicable, shall remain fully liable and responsible for all
liabilities, costs and expenses relating to all such Benefit Plans.

 

(f) _COBRA_. Sellers acknowledge and agree that the "Selling Group" (as
such term is defined in Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-3 of the Treasury Regulations)
shall be solely liable, and that neither Buyer shall have any obligation or
liability, for providing continuation coverage under and complying with COBRA
with respect to any individual who prior to the Closing was covered under any
Benefit Plan that constitutes a group health plan contributed to or maintained
by any member of the Selling Group and who will be an "MandA Qualified
Beneficiary" (as such phrase is defined in Section 54.4980B- 9, QandA-4 of the
Treasury Regulations) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and who is not a Buyer Employee or dependent thereof (the " _Seller
COBRA Beneficiaries_ "). Each Seller agrees to cause the Selling Group to
provide continuing health benefit coverage as required under COBRA ("
_COBRA Coverage_ ") to all Station Operation Employees and Non-Operation
Support Employees, other than Buyer Employees, who are MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. Buyers acknowledge and agree that Buyers

 



85  shall be solely liable, and that neither Seller nor any of their Affiliates
shall have any obligation or liability, for providing continuation coverage
under and complying with COBRA with respect to any Buyer Employee (or any
dependent thereof who is not an MandA Qualified Beneficiary prior to the
Closing) whose "qualifying event" (as defined under COBRA) occurs after the
Closing. If Sellers obligation to provide COBRA Coverage to the Seller COBRA
Beneficiaries shifts to either Buyer pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9, QandA-8(c), then, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Sellers shall reimburse such Buyer for any and all
documented costs and expenses that such Buyer reasonably incurs in providing
COBRA Coverage to Seller COBRA Beneficiaries (including, but not limited
to, claims, administrative costs, fees and insurance premiums); provided that
in no event will Sellers have any Liability to Buyers with respect to any
costs or expenses incurred in providing COBRA Coverage to any Buyer Employee
(or any dependent thereof who is not an MandA Qualified Beneficiary prior to
the Closing). Buyers shall invoice Sellers monthly with respect to such costs
and expenses, together with documentation showing such costs and expenses have
been incurred, and Sellers shall be obligated to make full payment of each
such invoice within thirty (30) Business Days of the date of such invoice. If
Sellers dispute the amount of any invoice described in this _Section 6.4(f)_ ,
the manner of its computation, or the underlying data on which the invoice
was based, they shall notify Buyers and, for a period of thirty (30) Business
Days thereafter, Buyers shall make available all documentation necessary for
Sellers to review the invoice, the computation and the data. If, upon
completion of their review, Sellers and Buyers are not in agreement upon the
amount of the invoice, then the matter shall be referred to a firm of
certified public accountants selected by mutual agreement of Sellers
and Buyers, which firm shall make a final binding decision as to the correct
amount of the invoice. If Sellers fail to timely pay any amounts of any
undisputed invoices, Sellers shall also be obligated to pay interest with
respect to the unpaid amounts at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.4(f)_ shall relieve any
Party of any obligation or liability such Party may have under applicable Law
for providing continuation coverage under and complying with COBRA with
respect to any Buyer Employee (or any dependent thereof who is not an MandA
Qualified Beneficiary prior to the Closing) nor shall it require any Party to
be responsible for any such obligation or liability of any other Party.

(g) _WARN Act_. With respect to the Buyer Employees, Buyer will have full
responsibility under the WARN Act caused by any act or omission of Buyer
after the Closing Date. With respect to the employees of Sellers, including
the Buyer Employees, Sellers will have full responsibility under the WARN Act
caused by any act or omission of Sellers prior to or on the Closing Date.
With respect to the employees of Sellers, excluding the Buyer Employees,
Sellers will have full responsibility under the WARN Act caused by any act or
omission after the Closing Date. Sellers shall be responsible for all other
WARN Act Liabilities relating to the periods prior to, on and after the
Closing Date, including any such Liabilities that result from employees
separation of employment from Sellers and/or employees not becoming Buyer
Employees pursuant to this _Section 6.4(g)_.

(h) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this  _Section 6.4_
shall (i) create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee
or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Sellers
or their Affiliates in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) with Buyers or their Affiliates or create any such rights in any
such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under

 



86  any employee benefit plan that may exist or be established by any Buyer or
any of its Affiliates; (ii) be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan
or any other employee benefit plan; or (iii) constitute a limitation on
rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Closing Date any employee
benefit plan of any Buyer, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

Section 6.5 Post-Closing Access to Information and Confidentiality.

 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years from and after the Closing Date,
Sellers and Buyers shall provide each other, and shall cause their respective
appropriate Representatives to provide, when reasonably requested to do so by
the other Party (and at the requesting Parties sole cost and expense), access
to all Tax, financial, accounting or other records of or relating to the
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the Business (x) permitted to be retained
by Sellers under this Agreement, in the case of Sellers, or (y) in respect of
any Straddle Period, and the right to make copies or extracts therefrom at
its expense. During such seven (7) year period, none of the Parties shall, nor
shall they permit their Affiliates (and in the case of Sellers, the Other ET
Entities) or Representatives to, intentionally dispose of, alter or
destroy any such books, records and other data without giving at least thirty
(30) days prior written notice to the other Party and permitting such other
Party, at its sole cost and expense, to examine, duplicate or repossess such
records, files, documents and correspondence; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Parties shall be permitted to dispose of or destroy books, records and
other data to the extent permitted by applicable Law and in compliance with
such Parties ordinary course document retention policies and procedures.

(b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, each
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (and in the case of Sellers, the
Other ET Entities) and Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all
proprietary information and data, whether written or oral, relating to
Buyers, the Business, the Assets, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including any information
and data treated as confidential information under the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it
is acknowledged and agreed that each Seller may disclose such information or
data (i) to its Representatives, so long as any such Representative to whom
such disclosure is made needs to know such information in order to (A) assist
Sellers in connection with any actual or potential Proceeding with respect to
the matters contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any
Liability retained by or allocable to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, (B) assist Sellers with respect to their obligations
to comply with any applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any stock
exchange, or (C) assist Sellers with respect to the preparation or review of
any historical financial information with respect to periods in which Sellers
owned the Assets or the Business or (ii) at the request of any Governmental
Entity or as required by an applicable Law or legal process;  _provided_ that
in such event such Seller will provide prior notice to the extent practicable
of such disclosure to Buyers, exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve the confidentiality of the confidential information,
including, without limitation, reasonably cooperating with Buyers (at Buyers
sole expense) to obtain an appropriate order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information or data by such
Governmental Entity or during such legal process and will disclose only that
portion of the confidential information that such Seller is legally required
to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the confidentiality provisions of
this _Section 6.5(b)_ shall not apply to any information or data that has
been, is or

 



87  will be (1) generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure in violation of this Agreement, (2) available to Sellers or their
Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a Person who is not known,
after reasonable inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with
Buyers, or (3) is independently developed by Sellers or their
Representatives without use of or reference to the proprietary information.
At Closing, all confidential information that is also an Asset or to the
extent related thereto shall become the property of Buyers ( _provided_ that
nothing in this sentence is intended to modify the agreements with respect to
the Documents required to be delivered to Buyers pursuant to this Agreement).

 

Section 6.6 Further Assurances. Upon request of a Party and without
further consideration, each other Party shall execute and deliver to the
requesting Party such documents and take such actions, which are consistent
with the provisions of this Agreement, as the requesting Party reasonably
requests to consummate more effectively the intent and purpose of the Parties
under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if, after the Effective Time, Buyers
seek indemnification or recovery from one or more other parties to an Assumed
Contract or otherwise seeks to enforce such Assumed Contract and, to obtain
such indemnification, recovery or enforcement, it is necessary for Sellers or
their Affiliates to initiate a suit, participate in any
enforcement proceeding or otherwise provide assistance to Buyers, then, at
the request of Buyers, Sellers and their Affiliates shall take such action as
Buyers may reasonably request in connection with Buyers efforts to obtain
such indemnification, recovery or enforcement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyers shall (a) reimburse Sellers for all reasonable fees, costs and expenses
related to such action and (b) indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses relating to or
arising from such action.

 

Section 6.7 Contact with Business Relations. Except as set forth in
_Section 5.1(a)_ , during the period from the Signing Date until the earlier
of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, Buyers hereby agree that they are not authorized to and shall not
(and shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or
Affiliates to) contact any employee (excluding any executive officer),
customer, supplier, dealer, material supplier, distributor or other material
business relation of a Seller regarding Sellers or the Business.

Section 6.8 Casualty.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 6.9_, Sellers shall bear the
risk of condemnation and the risk of loss, damage or destruction of the Real
Property by fire, lightning storm, windstorm, hail, explosion, flooding,
hurricane, earthquake, landslide, subversion, theft, act of God, act of
terrorism or other casualty event (" _Casualty_ ") prior to the Closing.

(b) If any Real Property is damaged by a Casualty prior to the Closing
(or, with respect to any Real Property that is Leased Real Property in respect
of which funds are held in the LSP Escrow Account, at any time after Closing
until such funds are released from the LSP Escrow Account) (each,
together with an Open Pre-Signing Casualty, a " _Casualty Event_ "), (i) as
promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 48 hours of being on notice
of the occurrence thereof), Sellers shall notify Buyers of such Casualty
Event in writing or verbally (so long as Sellers also provide notice in
writing within a reasonable time), which such notice shall

 



88  specify with reasonable particularity the applicable Real Property, the loss
or damage incurred in the Casualty Event, and the cause thereof, in each case,
to the extent then known, and (ii) as promptly as practicable, Sellers shall
provide Buyers with (A) any information in _clause (i)_ that was not known
when the foregoing notice was given and (B) a good faith estimate of the cost
to repair such damage on the particular Real Property (to the extent, in the
case of Leased Real Property, that a Seller is obligated to perform any
repairs under the applicable Real Property Lease) by a reputable independent
third party who is selected by Sellers and is reasonably approved by Buyers;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the failure of Sellers to give the foregoing notices to Buyers shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement for the purposes of  _Article VII_,
_Article VIII_ or _Article X_ only if Sellers remedy the Casualty prior to
the Closing. With respect to any Casualty Event following which Sellers do not
restore, prior to Closing, the Real Property to the same or substantially
similar condition as it was in prior to the Casualty Event, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

 

(i) subject to _clause (iii)_ of this _Section 6.8_, if the estimated
cost to repair the damage to the Real Property in such Casualty Event is less
than or equal to the lesser of fifteen (15%) of the Assigned Drop Value of
such Real Property or Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), then
Sellers shall pay Buyers the amount necessary to complete the repairs to such
Real Property as reflected in such estimate (after taking into account any
repairs actually undertaken by Sellers prior to the Closing), and Buyers shall
be deemed to have waived any other rights to recover any Losses arising from
such damage (including under _Article VIII_), and this transaction shall be
closed as to such Real Property;

 

(ii) if the estimated cost to repair such damage to the Real Property in
such Casualty Event is in excess of the lesser of fifteen percent (15%) of
the Assigned Drop Value of such Real Property or Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000) and Seller cannot, or elects not to, restore the applicable
Station Property to a state in which the Business can be carried out thereat
in a manner consistent with past practice, Buyers shall have the option, in
their discretion, to either (A) treat the Real Property as a Rejected Property
and reduce the Purchase Price by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to such
Real Property on _Schedule 2.7_ , or (B) require Sellers to pay Buyers the
amount necessary to repair such damage as reflected in the estimate provided
above with respect to such Casualty Event (after taking into account any
repairs actually undertaken by Sellers prior to the Closing) and Buyers shall
be deemed to have waived any other rights to recover any Losses arising from
such damage (including under _Article VIII_), and this transaction shall be
closed as to such Real Property and Sellers shall be entitled to retain any
insurance proceeds paid as a result of such Casualty Event under Sellers
casualty policy;

 

(iii) if the Casualty impacts a Leased Real Property and the applicable
landlord has the right to terminate the applicable Real Property Lease as a
result thereof (and such right has not been waived and the time period, if
any, for exercising such right has not expired and does not expire prior to
the Closing), then Buyers shall have the option, in their discretion, to
treat such Real Property as a Rejected Property and the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to such Real Property; or

 



89 (iv) if the Casualty impacts a Leased Real Property and the applicable
landlord validly exercises a right to terminate the applicable Real Property
Lease as a result thereof, then such Real Property shall be deemed to be a
Rejected Property and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned
Drop Value assigned to such Real Property.

 

Section 6.9 Condemnation. If, after the date hereof and before the
Closing, except as set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ , a part of the Real Property
is taken, or noticed or, to Knowledge of Sellers, threatened for taking, by
eminent domain (together with the Open Pre-Signing Condemnation Actions,
each, a " _Condemnation Action_ "), Sellers shall give Buyers written notice
thereof as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 48 hours of
any Seller first obtaining knowledge of the occurrence thereof). If such
Condemnation Action would reasonably be expected to have a permanent and
material and adverse effect on the Real Property or the Business at such Real
Property (each, a " _Total Condemnation Action_ "), then Buyers shall have
the option, in their sole discretion, to (a) treat such Real Property as a
Rejected Property and reduce the Purchase Price by the Assigned Drop Value
assigned to such Real Property on _Schedule 2.7_ or (b) in consultation with
Sellers, mutually agree on an equitable reduction of the Purchase Price with
respect to such Real Property, taking into account, among other things, the
probable amount of condemnation proceeds to be received in connection with
such Total Condemnation Action, the party to whom such proceeds are to be
paid, the cost of restoring such Real Property, and the party obligated to
make such restoration, in which case, Buyers shall be deemed to have waived
any other right to recover Losses in connection with such Total Condemnation
Action (including pursuant to _Article VIII_ ). In the event of any
Condemnation Action that is not a Total Condemnation Action (each, a "
_Partial Condemnation Action_ "), then Buyers shall have the option, in their
sole discretion, to (i) in consultation with Sellers, equitably reduce the
Purchase Price with respect to the Real Property subject to such Partial
Condemnation Action (but in any event, by an amount less than the applicable
Assigned Drop Value), taking into account the probable amount of condemnation
proceeds received or to be received in connection with such Partial
Condemnation Action, the party to whom such proceeds have been or are to be
paid, the cost of restoring such Real Property, and the party obligated to
make such restoration, in which case, Buyers shall be deemed to have waived
any other right to recover Losses in connection with such Partial
Condemnation Action (including pursuant to _Article VIII_ ), or (ii) require
Sellers to (A) pay to Buyers on the Closing any proceeds (except for
reimbursement of costs actually incurred by Sellers prior to the Closing)
actually received by Sellers at or prior to the Closing as a result of the
respective condemnation and (B) assign to Buyers the right to receive any
future proceeds received in respect of such condemnation. Sellers shall
advise Buyers of any condemnation proceeds received with respect to any Real
Property. To the extent a Partial Condemnation Action has occurred prior to
the date hereof and such Partial Condemnation Action is not resolved pursuant
to the process outlined above and (1) the Partial Condemnation Action has not
been completed prior to Closing or (2) Sellers have not completed any
necessary repairs or other work, Sellers shall, when received, pay to Buyers
the proceeds thereof.

 

Section 6.10 Operator-On Boarding. Between the Signing Date and the
Closing, Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers efforts to establish a
legally-binding business relationship between Buyers and each commissioned
marketer or other third party that Buyers select to operate any
Station Property upon and following the applicable CIC Conversion Date;

 



90   _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any actual documented out-of-
pocket third-party expenses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Parties
relating to or arising from Sellers compliance with this _Section_ __ _
6.10_, but solely to the extent that such third-party expenses exceed the
amount of third-party expenses that would otherwise be incurred by Sellers to
transfer such Station Property to Buyers.

 

Section 6.11 Inspection and Maintenance Deficiencies.

 

(a) If in connection with the inspections conducted by Buyers of the Assets
prior to Closing, Buyers identify failures, material defects or material
disrepair regarding the HVAC, refrigeration equipment, above ground fuel
dispensers, canopies, point-of-sale systems, electronic price signs, electric
service, fire suppression system, plumbing (including sewer), roofs, parking
lots, outside signage and lighting, car wash equipment, foundation or
structural aspects of the Station Properties or other material equipment, or
material deficiencies with regard to compliance with applicable Law
(including the Americans with Disabilities Act), with respect to which repairs
are required by Law or are necessary to return the equipment to good operating
condition taking into account the age and intended use of the Asset (the "
_Repairs_ "), Buyers will obtain an estimate of the cost of the Repairs or, if
such item is not reasonably repairable, an estimate of the cost to replace
such item. Sellers and Buyers will, prior to Closing, agree on an estimated
amount to complete the Repairs, or if the applicable item is not reasonably
repairable the cost to replace such item (in any such case, the " _Repair
Amount_ "). If Sellers and Buyers are unable to agree on the Repair Amount,
the Repair Amount shall be determined by an independent third-party appraiser
selected by Sellers and Buyers with experience in estimating the cost of the
applicable repairs or replacements, with the fees and expenses of such
appraiser payable one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyers. Subject to the
terms of this _Section 6.11_, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to complete (or, where Repairs are the responsibility of the landlord
under the applicable lease, use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce
Sellers rights to cause such landlord to complete) all Repairs prior to
Closing and to provide Buyers with evidence of such completion. If, despite
the use of Sellers commercially reasonable efforts, Sellers are unable to
complete (or, where applicable, to cause the responsible landlord to complete)
the Repairs by the Closing Date, the cost of the unfinished Repairs (based on
the Repair Amount) will be deducted from the Purchase Price and Buyers shall
have no further right to recover Losses in connection with such Repair
(including pursuant to  _Article VIII_). Nothing in this section will affect
or limit Sellers obligations under _Section 5.2_.

 

(b) In addition, (i) if any roof of any of the Station Properties is in a
state of failure or has such material defect as it is not functional or
serviceable and the cost of repair would be greater than the cost of
replacement or is not reasonably repairable (which term includes roofs that
may be repairable, but would reasonably be expected to require additional
repair in the next twelve (12) months) then Buyers will obtain an estimate
from a contractor reasonably approved by Sellers of the cost of a new roof and
the full estimated cost of the new roof will be deducted on the Closing
Date from the Purchase Price and Buyers shall have no further right to
recover Losses in connection therewith (including pursuant to _Article VIII_ )
and (ii) if any HVAC or refrigeration unit or any car wash equipment of any of
the Station Properties is in a state of failure or has such material defect
as it is not functional or serviceable and the cost of repair would be greater
than the cost of replacement or is not reasonably repairable (which term
includes HVAC or refrigeration units that may be repairable, but would
reasonably be

 



91  expected to require additional repair in the next twelve (12) months) then
Buyers will obtain an estimate from a contractor reasonably approved by
Sellers of the cost of a new unit and the full estimated cost of the new unit
will be deducted on the Closing Date from the Purchase Price and Buyers shall
have no further right to recover Losses in connection therewith (including
pursuant to _Article VIII_ ).

 

Section 6.12 Delivery of Documents. Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyers, all of
the Documents on the Closing Date and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, as promptly as practicable
thereafter, all of the Documents not previously delivered on the Closing
Date. From and after the Closing, to the extent that any Buyer reasonably
requests that Seller provide to Buyer any additional specified category of
books, files, records, or other materials and documents of Sellers
relating to any Station Property or to the extent relating exclusively to the
Business or the Assets, and such documents are in the possession of Sellers,
then Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyers
copies of such documents in whatever format they exist; _provided_ that
Sellers may retain an original or copy of each such document to the extent it
relates to any Excluded Asset or constitutes a Sellers Record.

 

Section 6.13 Effect of Rejected Properties; Purchase Price Adjustments.

 

(a) Whether or not identified in any specific section of this Agreement, if
a Station Property is designated a Rejected Property pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, (i) neither such Station Property nor any of the
Assets located at or exclusively associated with such Station Property shall
be deemed to be part of the Assets or Business for any purposes under this
Agreement, including with respect to determining whether or not any
representation or warranty has been breached by any Party for purposes of
determining whether any condition to Closing is satisfied or whether any Party
is entitled to indemnification; provided that the foregoing provision shall
have no effect on Buyers ability to seek indemnification for any Excluded
Liabilities or pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ with respect to matters occurring
prior to such Station Property becoming a Rejected Property, (ii) the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to such
Station Property, (iii) all Liabilities to the extent attributable to or
arising from such Rejected Property shall be deemed to be an Excluded
Liability and not be a part of the Assumed Liabilities for any purposes under
this Agreement, and (iv) if applicable any Real Property Lease associated with

circumstances);

 

(b) except for any Losses in respect of (i) breaches of the representations
and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.4_ (Tax Matters) or (ii) the Seller
Fundamental Representations (it being understood that Losses arising from

obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to any
matter set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(d)_ exceed in the

(d) for purposes of determining (i) whether any representation or warranty
is inaccurate or has been breached and (ii) the amount of Loss resulting from
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty, calculating
Losses under this _Article VIII_, and satisfying the Deductible and Per-
Claim Deductible, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications
contained in the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and other
obligations shall be disregarded such that each representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement and other obligation shall be deemed to be made or given

Deductible, after which 

 



100  the Seller Indemnified Parties may seek recovery only for Losses in excess
of the Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Losses may be claimed by
any Seller Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable or shall be included in
calculating the aggregate Losses for purposes of this _subsection (g)_ other
than Losses in excess of the Per-Claim Deductible resulting from any
single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances;

Representations (it being understood that Losses arising from this _subsection
(h)_ shall not be subject to the limitations of this _subsection (h)_), the
aggregate amount of Losses for which Buyers are obligated to indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Parties under _Section 8.3(a)_ in respect of the Buyer
General Representations shall not exceed the Cap;

 

(i) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which Buyers are
obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any
matter set forth in _Section 8.3_ exceed in the aggregate the Purchase Price;

indemnification either under _Section 8.2(a)_  or _Section 8.2(b)_ on the
basis of Sellers breach or default in, or failure to carry out, perform,
satisfy and discharge their obligations under _Section 5.16_, then the Buyer
Indemnified Party shall assert the claim (i) under _Section 8.2(a)_ if the
change, event, circumstance, development, condition, occurrence or effect that
was not disclosed would not have resulted in any of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ not being satisfied if it had been disclosed or (ii) under
_Section 8.2(b)_ if the change, event, circumstance, development, condition,
occurrence or effect that was not disclosed would have resulted in any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII not being satisfied if it had been
disclosed. If any Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to assert a claim for
indemnification either under _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ on the
basis of Buyers breach or default in, or failure to carry out, perform,
satisfy and discharge their obligations under _Section 5.16_, then the Seller
Indemnified Party shall assert the claim (A) under _Section 8.3(a)_ if the
change, event, circumstance, development, condition, occurrence or effect
that was not disclosed would not have resulted in any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ not being satisfied if it had been disclosed or (B)
under _Section 8.3(b)_ if the change, event, circumstance, development,
condition, occurrence or effect that was not disclosed would have resulted in
any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ not being satisfied if it
had been disclosed; and

 

(k) For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall be entitled to, or obligated
to provide, indemnification under this  _Article VIII_ for any breach or
nonperformance under the APlus License Agreement, the LTC License Agreement,
the Stripes License Agreement, the Supply Agreement, the Transition Services
and Operations Agreement, or the Transportation Services Agreement.

Section 8.5 Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between Buyers and
Sellers. Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (either such
Party, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") making an indemnification claim pursuant to
this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim
shall provide written notice (each, an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") to the
Party or Parties that are obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party in
accordance with this Agreement (such Party or Parties, the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") as soon as reasonably

 



101  practicable after becoming aware of such indemnification claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement except to the extent such Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced by reason of such failure. The Indemnification
Notice shall reasonably set forth the specific facts and circumstances, in
reasonable detail (to the extent then reasonably known), giving rise to the
claim, the amount of Loss or Losses (or a non-binding, reasonable estimate
thereof if the actual amount is not known and, to the extent known, the
method of calculation of such amount) that the Indemnified Party has suffered,
sustained or incurred, or expects to suffer, sustain or incur, and the
specific Section(s) of this Agreement upon which the Indemnified Party is
relying in seeking such indemnification and such other information with
respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.

 

Section 8.6 Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims.

 

(a) Any Indemnified Party making a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ for any third party claim shall deliver an
Indemnification Notice to the Indemnifying Party promptly (but in no event
more than thirty (30) days) after becoming aware of any Proceeding against the
Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement except to the extent such
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by reason of such
failure. The Indemnification Notice shall reasonably set forth the specific
facts and circumstances, in reasonable detail (to the extent then reasonably
known), giving rise to the claim, the amount of Loss or Losses (or a non-
binding, reasonable estimate thereof if the actual amount is not known and, to
the extent known, the method of calculation of such amount) that the
Indemnified Party has suffered, sustained or incurred, or expects to suffer,
sustain or incur, and the specific Section(s) of this Agreement upon which the
Indemnified Party is relying in seeking such indemnification and such other
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request, and a copy of all pleadings and correspondence to or from any third
party related thereto, if available. Any Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying
Partys expense, and at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim against an Indemnified Party with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party is, or could be determined to be, obligated to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement by
appointing counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the
Indemnifying Partys sole expense, to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of
its choice for such purpose ( _provided_ that notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary other than the immediately following sentence, the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party and
shall not be recoverable from such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue control of
the defense of any Third Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party shall assume
defense thereof and all reasonable attorneys fees and expenses relating
thereto shall constitute Losses subject to indemnification hereunder) if (i)
the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
Proceeding involving actions by any Indemnified Party or any other Proceeding
by a Governmental Entity involving any Indemnified Party, (ii) the Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified

 



102  Party, (iii) the Third Party Claim has or would reasonably be expected to
result in Losses a substantial portion of which are in excess of the
applicable limitations on liability, if any, to Sellers indemnification
obligations set forth in _Section 8.4_ with respect to such Third Party
Claim, and Sellers and Guarantors do not waive the applicability of such
limitations on liability (such that Sellers and Guarantors assume liability
for all Losses in respect of such Third Party Claim), (iv) the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes (based on the advice of counsel) that the interests
of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to such
claim are in conflict with one another and, as a result, the Indemnifying
Party could not adequately represent the interests of the Indemnified Party in
such claim, (v) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to defend in
good faith the Third Party Claim, (vi) the Indemnifying Party has not
acknowledged in writing that such Third Party Claim is subject to, and
Indemnified Party is entitled to, indemnification pursuant to this _Article
VII_I ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such acknowledgment shall not include
any waiver or statement regarding the merits of the Third Party Claim itself),
or (vii) the Indemnifying Party fails to give written notice that it will
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Indemnified Partys Indemnification Notice in accordance with
_Section 11.6_ and this _Section 8.6(a)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the case of  _clause (vi)_ or _(vii)_ , if at any point during the defense
of a Third Party Claim that an Indemnifying Party was not entitled to assume
due to _clause (vi)_ or _(vii)_ hereof, the Indemnifying Party
subsequently acknowledges in writing the matters contemplated therein, then
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled from and after the time of such
acknowledgment, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does,
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section
8.6_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to conduct such defense and
take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and
on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim and to employ, at its own expense, counsel separate from
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not
be entitled to adjust, compromise or settle any Third Party Claim or permit a
default or consent to the entry of any judgment without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (i) such settlement, adjustment,
compromise or judgment consists solely of money damages to be fully paid by
the Indemnifying Party, (ii) such settlement, adjustment, compromise or
judgment includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant
or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a full and complete written release
of each Indemnified Party and its Representatives, reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, from all Losses or other Liability in respect to such
Third Party Claim, (iii) such settlement, adjustment, compromise or judgment
would not result in the statement of liability, wrongdoing, criminal offense
or finding or admission of any violation of Law by the Indemnified Party, and
(iv) as a result of such settlement, adjustment, compromise or judgment, no
injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not or is not permitted to assume, or
continue control of, or withdraws from, the defense of a Third Party Claim
pursuant to this _Section 8.6_ and the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall not settle, adjust or compromise
or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment in respect of any
Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party shall have any obligation as a
result of such settlement (whether monetary or otherwise) unless such
settlement,

 



103  adjustment, compromise or judgment is consented to in writing by the
Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. All attorneys fees and other costs and expenses relating to the
defense by the Indemnified Party shall be included in Losses except as
provided in _Section 8.6(a)_.

 

(c) Each Party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) if the Indemnified Party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 8.6_, the
Indemnifying Party shall make available to the Indemnified Party any
documents and materials in its possession or control that may be necessary to
the defense, negotiation, settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third
Party Claim and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 8.6_, the Indemnified Party
shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any documents and materials in
its possession or control that may be necessary to the defense,
negotiation, settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third Party Claim.
Any consent to be given by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this _Section
8.6_ shall be given by any Buyer acting on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and any consent to be given by the Seller Indemnified Parties under
this _Section 8.6_ shall be given solely by any Seller acting for and on
behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties.

 

(d) With respect to a Third Party Claim under this _Section 8.6_, after
(i) any final decision, judgment, or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal therefrom, (ii) a settlement, adjustment or compromise
shall have been consummated, or (iii) the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums
due and owing by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Agreement
with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying Party shall pay all of such
remaining sums so due and owing to the Indemnified Party in accordance with
this _Section 8.6_, within ten (10) Business Days following the
determination of such sums in accordance with the foregoing _clauses (i)_ ,
_(ii)_ and _(iii)_.

 

(e) If for whatever reason (including the Indemnifying Partys failure to
pay any judgment, settlement, adjustment, compromise, attorneys fees or
court costs with respect thereto), the Indemnified Party is required to pay
any indemnification claim or any portion thereof, or if the Indemnified Party
is permitted under the terms hereof to retain its own counsel with respect to
any indemnification claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense, the Indemnified
Party may pay such amounts which the Indemnified Party may deem reasonably
appropriate after giving written notice of same to the Indemnifying Party. In
the event of any such payments by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section 8.6(e)_ , the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified
Party for the amounts actually so paid by the Indemnified Party within
ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys written demand therefor.

 



104 Section 8.7 Insurance Effect.

 

(a) The amount payable under this _Article VIII_ in respect of any Loss
shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party on account thereof, which insurance proceeds shall be net of
(i) any out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party in pursuing
the same and (ii) the deductible or self-insured retention for such insurance
policies; _provided_ that, Buyers shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain insurance proceeds from any Title Policies if the facts or
circumstances support valid claims against the insurance policies but shall
not otherwise be required to seek to obtain insurance proceeds or institute
Proceedings in order to obtain insurance proceeds.

 

(b) In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made at any time
after an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party has been made with
respect to any indemnified Loss, then, to the extent of the amount of such
indemnification payment, a refund equal to the aggregate net amount of the
recovery (after deducting (i) any out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Party in pursuing the same and (ii) the deductible for such
insurance policies) shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of
such recovery to the applicable Indemnifying Party.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
the obligations or restrictions related to insurance or recovery of claims or
any other limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ shall apply to any
environmental insurance policy procured by Buyers.

Section 8.8 Characterization of Indemnification Payments; Withholding.
Unless otherwise required by Law, all payments made pursuant to _Article_ __ _
VIII_ hereof shall be treated for U.S. federal and applicable state income Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 

Section 8.9 Source of Payments. Except with respect to any offset under the
Supply Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Guarantee Agreement
and the Supply Agreement, any amounts payable by Buyers or Sellers with
respect to an indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ VIII_
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
applicable Sellers or Buyers within ten (10) Business Days of the final
determination thereof.

 

Section 8.10 Duty to Mitigate. Subject to any limitations set forth in 
_Section 8.7_, in all cases in which an Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified in accordance with this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses, including by
pursuing commercially reasonable rights and remedies available to such
Indemnified Party against third parties which are reasonably likely to result
in a net reduction of Losses with respect to which such Indemnified Party may
be entitled to indemnification hereunder and by incurring costs to the extent
necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall not be required to commence or
participate in any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (material
or otherwise) to any third parties; _provided_ , _further_ , that (a) all out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such efforts to
mitigate and (b) the deductible for any insurance policies that cover Losses,
shall, in each case, constitute Losses subject to indemnification hereunder.
For the avoidance of doubt, absent bad faith, a failure to successfully
mitigate on the part of an Indemnified Party shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder.

 



105 Section 8.11 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and obligations of an Indemnifying Party contained in
this Agreement and the Closing Documents, and an Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification or any other remedy with respect thereto, shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made at any time by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its
Representatives) or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its
Representatives) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy of,
compliance with or performance of, any such representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation. The waiver or non-assertion of any
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, as the case may be, or any termination right set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any such covenant,
agreement or obligation, shall not affect any Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and obligations.

 

Section 8.12 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to the right of each Party to seek
specific performance and injunction of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 11.18_ or any other provisions hereof granting any other form of
equitable relief or any other rights or remedies or providing for dispute
resolution following the Closing (including _Section_ __ _ 6.1_), from and
after the Closing, and without limiting the provisions of this _Article_ __ _
VIII_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the indemnification
provisions contained in this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parties for any Losses arising out of, related to, or
in connection with this Agreement or the Closing Documents, whether sounding
in tort, contract or otherwise, or whether at law or in equity. In
furtherance of the foregoing, but subject to the exceptions set forth in the
two immediately preceding sentences, each Seller, on the one hand, and each
Buyer, on the other hand, hereby waives on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights
and remedies it or they may have against the other Party arising under or
based upon this Agreement or the Closing Documents, in equity or otherwise
(including those based on statutory and common law negligence and strict
liability or arising under any Environmental Laws, including CERCLA), with
respect to indemnification claims except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article_ __ _ VIII_. No Party
shall be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement (or any Ancillary
Agreements) related to the breach of any representations, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein.

Section 8.13 No Limitations or Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud
or Criminal Activity. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the liability of any Party under this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ shall be
in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such Party may
have at law or in equity (whether arising by contract, tort or otherwise)
based on such Partys fraud, Willful Misconduct or criminal activity. No
provision set forth in this Agreement, including any other provision of this 
_Article_ __ _ VIII_, shall be deemed a waiver by any Party to this Agreement
of any right or remedy which such Party may have at law or in equity based on
any other Partys fraud, Willful Misconduct or criminal activity nor will any
such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (a) the amounts of recovery
sought or awarded in any such claim for such other Partys fraud, Willful
Misconduct or criminal activity; (b) the time period during which a claim
for such other Partys fraud, Willful Misconduct or criminal activity; or (c)
the recourse that any such Party may seek against another Party with respect
to a claim for such other Partys fraud, Willful Misconduct or criminal
activity. For purposes of this

 



106  Agreement, (i) "fraud" means actual, and not constructive, fraud with the
intent to deceive in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements and (ii) any Partys fraud, Willful
Misconduct or criminal activity by any officer or director acting with the
apparent authority of any Seller or any Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be deemed the Partys fraud, Willful Misconduct or criminal activity of,
respectively, Sellers and Buyers.

 

Section 8.14 Certain Intentions. THE PARTIES INTEND THAT THE INDEMNITIES
SET FORTH IN THIS  _ARTICLE_ __ _ VIII_ BE CONSTRUED AND APPLIED AS WRITTEN
ABOVE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY RULE OF CONSTRUCTION TO THE CONTRARY. WITHOUT
LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SUCH INDEMNITIES WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
STATES "EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE" OR SIMILAR RULE THAT WOULD DENY COVERAGE BASED
ON A PARTYS (THAT IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION) SOLE OR
CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES
THAT, TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED ABOVE, THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN THIS
_ARTICLE_ __ _ VIII_ WILL APPLY TO SUCH A PARTYS SOLE OR CONCURRENT, ACTIVE
OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS PROVISION IS "CONSPICUOUS"
FOR PURPOSES OF ALL STATE LAWS.

Section 8.15 Escrow Matters.

 

(a) If prior to the applicable Survival Date, a Buyer Indemnified Party
makes a bona fide indemnification claim by delivering an Indemnification
Notice to Sellers in accordance with this _Article VIII_, then Sellers shall,
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the each such Indemnification
Notice, notify Buyers in writing that either (i) Sellers agree and
acknowledge that (A) the claim underlying such Indemnification Notice is
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ and (B) Sellers
shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the applicable Buyer Indemnified
Party, from and against any and all Losses suffered, sustained, incurred or
required to be paid by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of the claims
underlying such Indemnification Notice, in accordance with this  _Article
VIII_ (each, an " _Indemnity Acknowledgment_ ") or (ii) Sellers do not believe
the claim underlying such Indemnification Notice is subject to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ (each, an " _Indemnity Dispute Notice_ ").
For any Indemnification Notice delivered by a Buyer Indemnified Party on or
prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, if Sellers deliver
an Indemnity Dispute Notice or Sellers fail to timely deliver an Indemnity
Acknowledgment, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
claim until the ninetieth (90th) day after the delivery of the
Indemnification Notice for such claim, and during such time, Buyers shall make
available to Sellers any non-privileged documents and materials in their
possession or control (and subject to reasonable and customary precautions to
comply with confidentiality obligations and applicable Law) that may be
necessary to evaluate the facts and circumstances underlying any claim. Any
claim with respect to which Sellers have not provided an Indemnity
Acknowledgment or Buyers have not withdrawn, and remains subject to dispute by
such date shall be referred to as a " _Claim Subject to Escrow_."

 

(b) In the event there is any Claim Subject to Escrow, then Sellers shall
promptly cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the
estimated Losses

 



107  of the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party set forth in the Indemnification
Notice (which amount may be a good faith estimate and shall not limit the
amount of Losses to which such Buyer Indemnified Party is ultimately entitled
to indemnification) to serve as non-exclusive, readily available funds to
satisfy the indemnification obligations of Sellers, if any, in respect of the
indemnification claim underlying such Indemnification Notice; provided, that
(i) Sellers shall not be required to deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Account
more than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in the aggregate in any calendar
quarter (each a " _Quarterly Indemnity Escrow Deposit_ ") and (ii) Sellers
shall not be required to deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Account more than
Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in the aggregate at any given time (it
being understood that (A) to the extent Sunoco would otherwise be required to
deposit funds in excess of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in respect of
indemnification claim(s) but for this provision, then Sunoco shall make
additional deposits into escrow in respect of such claim(s) if and when the
balance of the Indemnity Escrow Account is less than Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000) and (B) such amount is not intended to serve as a cap on Sellers
indemnification obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement or hereunder).
Sellers shall not be required to deposit any funds into the Indemnity Escrow
Account for indemnification claims made after the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date. However, if a Buyer Indemnified Party delivers an
Indemnification Notice prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date that requires Sellers to make a Quarterly Indemnity Escrow Deposit but
Sellers have not funded the full amount of estimated Losses set forth in
the related Indemnification Notice (regardless of whether such additional
payments into the Indemnity Escrow Account are before or after the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date), then Sellers shall continue to make
Quarterly Indemnity Escrow Deposits (on every three month anniversary of the
prior required payment date) into the Indemnity Escrow Account in respect of
such indemnification claim, subject to the Fifty Million Dollar ($50,000,000)
maximum on required escrow funds at any given time described above. The
Escrow Agent shall deposit such funds (and all other funds required to be
deposited in respect of claims which are the subject of other Indemnification
Notices) into a separate account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "). The
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be held in escrow as trust funds
and shall not be subject to any Lien, attachment, trustee process or other
judicial process of any creditor of any Person and shall be held and
disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The release
of any funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account shall occur only upon joint
written instructions or a final, non-appealable judgment, each as more fully
described in the Escrow Agreement. Prior to funding the Indemnity Escrow
Account for any claim made in an Indemnification Notice, if Sellers deliver
an Indemnity Acknowledgment for such claim and pay in full all Losses already
incurred to date by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of such claim
then Sellers shall not be required to deposit any funds into the Indemnity
Escrow Account in respect of such claim.

ARTICLE X

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 10.1 General. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, only as follows:

(a) By the written agreement of Buyers and Sellers;

 

(b) by Buyers or Sellers, by written notice given before the Closing, if
the Closing has not occurred on or before the nine month anniversary of the
Signing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such nine month period may be
extended for an additional three month period (for a total of 12 months from
the Signing Date) by either Buyers or Sellers in the event that all
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have
been satisfied or have been waived by Sellers and Buyers other than  _Section
7.1(b)_ ; _provided_ _further_ , that the agreement may be extended for an
additional three month period if both Buyers and Sellers agree in writing so
long as all conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing) continue to be satisfied or have been waived by Sellers and
Buyers other than _Section 7.1(b)_ ; _provided_ _however_ , that if a Party
seeking extension pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ is in breach in any
material respect of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, including such Partys failure to
satisfy any condition to the Closing that is within the control of such Party
(other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied by actions
taking at the Closing), then such Party may not extend this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 10.1(b)_ without the express written consent of the other
Party;

(c) By Buyers or Sellers, by written notice given before the Closing, if

(d) By Sellers, by written notice given before the Closing, if any of the
representations or warranties of Buyers set forth in this Agreement are not
true and correct or if a Buyer has failed to perform any covenant or agreement
on the part of such Buyer set forth in this Agreement (including an
obligation to consummate the Closing) that is the cause of the failure of any
of the conditions to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.1_ or _Section
7.3_, respectively, to be satisfied and the breach or breaches causing such
representations or warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to
perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not or are not capable
of being cured within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof is
delivered to Buyers; _provided_ that Sellers are not then in breach of this
Agreement; or

 

(e) By Buyers, by written notice given before the Closing, if any of the
representations or warranties of Sellers set forth in this Agreement are not
true and correct or if

 



112  Sellers have failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of
Sellers set forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the
Closing) that is the cause of the failure of any of the conditions set forth
in either _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, respectively, to be satisfied and
the breach or breaches causing such representations or warranties not to be
true and correct, or the failures to perform any covenant or agreement, as
applicable, are not or are not capable of being cured within sixty (60) days
after written notice thereof is delivered to Sellers; _provided_ that Buyers
are not then in breach of this Agreement.

 

(f) By Buyers, in accordance with _Section 5.22(e)_ , by written notice
given to Sellers not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the
conclusion of the arbitration proceeding contemplated by _Section 5.22(e)_.

 

Section 10.2 Procedure for Termination. To terminate this Agreement as
provided in  _Section 10.1(b)_ through _Section 10.1(e)_, the terminating
Party shall provide the other Parties with written notice of its election to
terminate this Agreement, and upon delivery of such written notice in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 11.6_, or upon termination by mutual written
agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, as applicable:

 

(a) The transactions contemplated hereby shall be terminated, without
further action by any Party;

 

(b) Buyers shall return or destroy all documents and copies and other
materials received from or on behalf of Sellers relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before, on or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 10.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, then this Agreement shall forthwith
become wholly void and of no further force and effect, and there shall be no
Liability under this Agreement on the part of Buyers or Sellers, except
that (i) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ and _Article_ __ _ XI_ and
any other Section or Article of this Agreement referenced in such provisions
which are required to survive in order to give appropriate effect to such
provisions, shall in each case survive any termination of this Agreement, and
(ii) any Liability of any Party for any failure to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement prior to such termination (including any
failure by a Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement if it is obligated to do so hereunder) shall remain in full force
and effect.

 

ARTICLE XI

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 11.1 Publicity. The Parties agree that, from and after the Signing
Date, prior to the Closing, no public release, written statement or
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
or made without the prior written consent of both Parties, except for the
content of any such release or announcement that is required by Law,
including the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities
exchange, which release or announcement shall be provided to the other Party
for its review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) as soon as reasonably practicable prior to

 



113  such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may issue a press
release on the Closing Date; _provided_ that such Party shall allow the other
Party reasonable time to comment on such release in advance of, and approve,
such issuance (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 

Section 11.2 Assignment. Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement, no Party may assign, transfer or encumber this Agreement,
or its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, voluntarily or by
operation of Law, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and
any attempted assignment, transfer or encumbrance without such consent shall
be void and without effect; _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing,
either Buyer may, without the prior consent of Sellers, assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations hereunder (a) to an Affiliate of such Buyer, (b)
to third parties as are reasonably necessary to facilitate the conversion of
any Station Property into a Station Property that becomes operated by a
commissioned marketer or other third party at or after the Closing, which may
include assigning to one or more third parties the right to acquire certain
Assets, and the obligation to pay the purchase price for such Assets, and the
inspection rights in _Section 5.1(a)_  and (c) assign or transfer their
rights hereunder and obligations to acquire the car wash Inventory and pay the
applicable purchase price with respect to the car wash Inventory included
within the Assets to Ryko Solutions, Inc. or its Affiliates. Upon any such
permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to the applicable Buyer
shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.
No such permitted assignment by either Buyer, in whole or in part, shall
release such Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder or under any Ancillary
Agreement, including with respect to the payment of the entire purchase price.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein or in any Ancillary
Agreement shall prevent any deemed indirect transfer by Sellers or Buyers of
this Agreement as a result of a recapitalization, reorganization, merger,
consolidation or other similar business combination of Sellers, Guarantors or
their respective Affiliates;  _provided_ that if Sellers, Guarantors and/or
such Affiliates or Buyer and/or such Affiliates are not the continuing or
surviving entities of such transaction, the applicable continuing or surviving
entity shall have assumed the obligations of Sellers, Guarantors or Buyers,
as applicable, under this Agreement.

 

Section 11.3 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 11.4 Amendment. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein,
no modifications, amendments or supplements to this Agreement, whether by
course of conduct or otherwise, shall be valid and binding unless set forth in
a written agreement executed and delivered by the Parties.

 

Section 11.5 Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no
waiver by any Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
effective unless set forth in a written instrument making specific reference
to this Agreement executed and delivered by the Party so waiving. No failure
on the part of a Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy shall constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of such right, power, or remedy by such Party preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power,
or remedy. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach.

 



114 Section 11.6 Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) and shall be sent by (a) delivery
in person by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) facsimile or
e-mail (with written confirmation of acceptance), (c) next day delivery by a
nationally recognized overnight courier, or (d) registered or certified mail
(postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the other Parties as follows:

in writing to the other Party in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.6_.
The inability to deliver notice because of a changed address of which no

Section 11.7 Table of Contents. The Table of Contents to this Agreement is
for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.8 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, then such provisions shall be construed so that the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected, but shall remain in full
force and effect, and any such illegal, void or unenforceable provisions
shall be deemed, without further action on the part of any person or entity,
to be modified, amended and/or limited, but only to the extent necessary to
render the same valid and enforceable in the applicable jurisdiction, so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
a determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced, the

 



116  Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transaction contemplated hereby is
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 11.9 No Strict Construction. Notwithstanding the fact that this
Agreement has been drafted or prepared by one of the Parties, each Party
confirms that both it and its counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted
this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the Parties. The
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any Party.

 

Section 11.10 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. The
Parties agree that this Agreement and all matters arising from or relating to
this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and the rights and
obligations of the Parties hereunder determined in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Texas, without regard to the conflict of laws principles
thereof. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Texas or, if jurisdiction is not available therein, the Texas district court
located in Dallas County, Texas, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, and each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such state court or, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, in such federal court. Without limitation
of other means of service, the Parties agree that service of any process,
summons, notice or document with respect to any action, suit or proceeding
may be served on it in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 11.6_. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any
objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court and any claim that such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of
the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in an appropriate court pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.10_ shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties, as the case may be,
and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction the Parties, as
the case may be, are or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment. THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BUYERS INVESTIGATION
OF THE BUSINESS, THE ASSETS, THIS AGREEMENT, THE NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONTRACT ENTERED INTO PURSUANT HERETO (EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) OR THE PERFORMANCE BY THE
PARTIES OF ITS OR THEIR TERMS IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY TYPE
BROUGHT BY ONE PARTY AGAINST THE OTHER, REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OF THE CLAIM
OR CAUSE OF ACTION.

 

Section 11.11 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement, each Party covenants, agrees and acknowledges
that no recourse under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any
documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement shall be had against any of Sellers or Buyers
respective past, present or future Related Parties, in each case other than
Sellers, Buyers or any of their respective successors and permitted assignees
under this Agreement, and other than any of Sellers or Buyers respective
past, present or future Related Parties under any

 



117  Ancillary Agreement to which such Related Party is party, whether by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by
virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that
no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise
be incurred by any of the past, present or future Related Parties, as such,
for any obligation or liability of a Seller or a Buyer under this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection herewith or therewith for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or liabilities or their creation; _provided_ , 
_however_ , nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ shall relieve or otherwise
limit the liability of a Seller or a Buyer, as such, for any breach or
violation of its obligations under such agreements, documents or
instruments. 

Section 11.12 Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules shall be
arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered
Sections and subsections contained in this Agreement, and the information
disclosed in any numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to
qualify other representations and warranties only to the extent the
applicability of such disclosure to such other representations and warranties
is readily apparent on its face. If there is any inconsistency between the
statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure
Schedules, the statements in the body of this Agreement shall control. The
information contained in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules attached
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation
of Law or breach of contract). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement, the information
and disclosures contained in any section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other Section of
the Disclosure Schedules as though fully set forth in such other section of
the Disclosure Schedules for which applicability of such information and
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The fact that any item of
information is disclosed in any section of the Disclosure Schedules shall not
be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall
not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. Any capitalized term
used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein has the
meaning given to such term in this Agreement.

 

Section 11.13 No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as set forth in 
_Article_ __ _ VIII_, the Parties agree that nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, is intended to confer any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement on any Persons other than the Parties, SUN
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No Person, other than
the Parties and SUN, may rely hereon or derive any benefit hereby as a third-
party beneficiary or otherwise.

 

Section 11.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements together with the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto and thereto, constitute the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral and written, between
the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof; there are no
conditions to this Agreement that are not expressly stated in this Agreement.
All Exhibits, Schedules and other attachments identified in this Agreement
are a material part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein by
reference.

 



118 Section 11.15 No Recording of this Agreement. Before the Closing, neither
Party shall record this Agreement among any land or clerks records or with
any other governmental office. If either Party records this Agreement, it
shall be deemed, at the option of the other Party: (a) ipso facto null and
void and of no further force; or (b) a material breach and serve as a basis
for termination or other remedies as provided by this Agreement.

 

Section 11.16 Time of Essence. With regard to all covenants, dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyers and Sellers hereby confirm their
intention and agreement that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, time shall be of the essence for the performance of all actions
(including, without limitation, the giving of notices, the delivery of
documents and the funding of money) required or permitted to be taken under
each and every provision of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent
modification or extension of any date or time period that is provided for
under this Agreement.

 

Section 11.17 Prevailing Party. If any litigation, other court action, or
proceeding is commenced by any Party to enforce its rights under this
Agreement against any other Party, all fees, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by the prevailing Party
in such litigation, action, arbitration, or proceeding shall be reimbursed by
the losing Party. As used in this Section, the term "prevailing Party" shall
mean the Party that has succeeded upon a significant issue in the action and
achieved a material benefit with respect to the claims at issue, taken as a
whole.

Section 11.18 Specific Performance. Sellers acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur to Buyers in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and Buyers acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur to Sellers in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of Buyers, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any
other remedy to which Buyers or Sellers may be entitled at law or in equity.
Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies which Buyers or Sellers may have under this
Agreement or otherwise.

 

Section 11.19 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or .pdf signatures) in one or more counterparts. All
counterparts shall collectively be deemed to constitute a single agreement,
such agreement becoming effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to all other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

Section 11.20 Time Periods. Any reference in this Agreement to the time for
the performance of obligations or elapsed time shall mean consecutive
calendar days, months, or years, as applicable. Whenever the term "day" is
used in this Agreement, it shall refer to a

 



119  calendar day unless otherwise specified. In computing any period of time
under this Agreement, the date of the act or event from which the designated
period of time begins to run shall not be included. In the event the time for
performance of any obligation hereunder expires on a day that is not a
Business Day, the time for performance shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day.

 

Section 11.21 Parent Guarantee. As a material inducement to Buyers
willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform their obligations
hereunder, Guarantors shall enter into a Guarantee Agreement (the " _Guarantee
Agreement_ "), in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyers, pursuant to which it
shall unconditionally guarantee full performance and payment by each Seller
of each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be
performed by such Seller under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
such that each Buyer shall have the right, exercisable in its sole
discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out
of any breach or nonperformance of any Seller (including nonpayment) directly
against either or all of Guarantors and Sellers in the first instance, in all
cases subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this
Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement.
