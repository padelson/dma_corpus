i      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(this "Agreement"), dated as of April 4 2002, by and among MASTERBRAND
CABINETS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), MBC ACQUISITION CORP., a
Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and OMEGA HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and, solely with respect to Articles VIII and
IX, the Holders Representative, are referred to collectively herein as the
"Parties."   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests
of each corporation and their respective stockholders that the Parties
consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein in which
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company continuing
as the surviving corporation (the "Merger");   WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to action taken in
accordance with the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL") and the bylaws of Merger Sub; and   WHEREAS, contemporaneously with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and an
inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, Parent is entering into a voting agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A-1 (the "Voting Agreement") with Mezzanine Lending
Associates III, L.P. (the "Principal Stockholder") pursuant to which, on the
terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the Principal Stockholder has
executed a written consent pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL (the "Written
Consent") with respect to all of the shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share of the Company (the "Company Common Shares") owned of record and
beneficially by the Principal Stockholder, in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
performed by the Company;   WHEREAS, prior to the Effective Time (as
hereafter defined), Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Holders
Representative (as hereafter defined) and the Escrow and Paying Agent (as
hereafter defined) will execute and deliver the Indemnity Escrow Agreement
(as hereafter defined);   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows:     1    ARTICLE I  THE
MERGER; EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING   1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and shall succeed
to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with
the DGCL. The Company, as the surviving corporation after the consummation of
the Merger, is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."   1.2 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated and the transactions contemplated herein shall have been abandoned
pursuant to Article X, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of counsel for Parent, on the
first Business Day after all of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by
their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date) to the obligations
of the Parties to consummate the Merger as set forth in Sections 6.3, 6.4,
and 6.5 have been satisfied or waived, or such other date, time or place as
is agreed to in writing by the Parties (the actual time and date of the
Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). At the Closing, (i)
the Company will deliver to Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub will deliver to
the Company, the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to
in Sections 6.3 6.4 and 6.5 below, (ii) the Company and Merger Sub will file
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of
merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-2 (the "Certificate of
Merger"), and (iii) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deliver the Merger Price, Option Payments, Warrant Payments and Indemnity
Escrow to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and the Escrow and Paying Agent, in
the manner provided below in Article IV.   1.3 Effective Time. Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as soon as practicable on the Closing Date. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
subsequent date or time as the Parties shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being
hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").   1.4 Effect of the
Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.    
2    ARTICLE II  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND  BYLAWS OF THE
SURVIVING CORPORATION   2.1 Certificate of Incorporation. As of the
Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the Company and
Merger Sub, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended
to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub
reads as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.   2.2 Bylaws.
At and after the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.   ARTICLE III  DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF  THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION   3.1 Directors of the Surviving Corporation. The directors of
the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective Time, will be the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.   3.2 Officers of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Surviving Corporation, as of the
Effective Time, will be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   ARTICLE IV  MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR 
CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER   4.1 Effect of the Merger on the
Shares.   (a) Conversion of the Company Common Shares. At the Effective 
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the 
holders thereof, each Company Common Share issued and outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any Company  Common
Shares held by the Company, which Company Common Shares, by  virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder  thereof, shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist with  no payment being made
with respect thereto and (ii) Dissenting Shares  (as defined in Section
4.1(c)), shall be cancelled and retired and  shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Price, payable  to the holder thereof, without
interest thereon (except as specifically  provided for in the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement), upon surrender of the  certificate formerly representing
such Company Common Share; provided,  however, that the amount payable to any
holder of Company Common Shares  who is an obligor on a Management Note shall
be reduced by the  principal amount of such Management     3   Note
plus accrued interest thereon to the Effective Time in accordance  with
Section 4.2(b) and such Management Note shall be deemed cancelled 
thereafter.   (b) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective 
Time, each share of common stock of the Merger Sub issued and  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of  the Merger and
without any further action on the part of the holder  thereof, be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid  and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of  the Surviving Corporation.  
(c) Dissenting Shares. To the extent that holders thereof are  entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, Company  Common Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time and held by a holder
who has properly exercised and perfected such  holder\'s demand for appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the  "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into the right to receive  the Merger Price, but the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be  entitled to receive from the Surviving
Corporation such consideration  as shall be determined pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL; provided,  however, that if any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall  effectively withdraw or lose such holder\'s right
to appraisal and  payment under the DGCL, each of such holder\'s Company
Common Shares  shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective  Time into the right to receive the Merger Price, without any
interest  thereon (except as specifically provided for in the Indemnity
Escrow  Agreement), upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing 
such Company Common Shares and such shares shall not be deemed to be 
Dissenting Shares.   (d) Fully-Diluted Stockholders; Merger Consideration. 
Concurrently with the delivery of the Net Indebtedness Certificate, the 
Company will deliver to Parent Schedule 4.1(d), which will be attached  to
this Agreement and will set forth the Fully-Diluted Stockholders,  the
aggregate Company Common Shares, Options or Warrants owned thereby,  and the
portion of the Merger Consideration allocable to such  Fully-Diluted
Stockholders calculated in accordance with the terms of  this Agreement.  
4.2 Payment for the Shares.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, U.S.
Bank National  Association shall act as paying agent (the "Escrow and Paying
Agent")  in effecting the payment of the Merger Price in respect of
certificates  (the "Certificates") that, prior to the Effective Time,
represented  Company Common Shares entitled to payment of the Merger Price
pursuant  to Section 4.1(a). At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall  deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Escrow and Paying Agent
the  aggregate Merger Price (net of the aggregate principal amount of the 
Management Notes plus accrued interest thereon to the Effective Time  held by
holders of Company Common Shares) to which holders of the  Company Common
Shares shall be entitled pursuant to this Article IV.     4    (b) At
or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall  provide to each record
holder of Certificates that immediately prior to  the Effective Time
represented Company Common Shares a form of letter  of transmittal in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Letter of  Transmittal") which shall,
among other things, (i) specify that  delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates  to the Escrow and Paying Agent, and instructions for use
in  surrendering such Certificates and receiving the Merger Price in 
respect thereof and (ii) include a waiver by such holder of any claims 
against the Company or its Subsidiaries that such holder has in its  capacity
as a stockholder of the Company. To the extent not previously  delivered to
any Fully-Diluted Stockholder at the Effective Time,  Parent shall cause the
Escrow and Paying Agent to mail the Letter of  Transmittal to such Fully-
Diluted Stockholder as promptly as  practicable. Upon the surrender of each
such Certificate, the Escrow  and Paying Agent shall pay the holder of such
Certificate an aggregate  amount equal to (i) the Merger Price multiplied by
(ii) the number of  Company Common Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, in  consideration therefor, and such Certificate shall forthwith
be  cancelled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount to be paid to any 
obligor on a Management Note pursuant to this Section 4.2(b) in respect  of
the Company Common Shares held by such obligor shall be reduced by  the
principal amount of such Management Note plus accrued interest  thereon to
the Effective Time and such Management Note shall be deemed  cancelled
thereafter. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate  (other than
Certificates representing (i) Company Common Shares held by  the Company or
held in the treasury of the Company or (ii) Dissenting  Shares) shall
represent solely the right to receive the aggregate  Merger Price relating
thereto (net of the principal amount of the  Management Notes plus accrued
interest thereon to the Effective Time).  Except as specifically provided in
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, no  interest or dividends shall be paid or
accrued on the Merger Price. If  the Merger Price (or any portion thereof) is
to be delivered to any  Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate formerly  representing Company Common Shares surrendered thereof
is registered,  it shall be a condition to such right to receive payment of
such Merger  Price that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or  otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting  such payment shall pay to the Escrow and Paying Agent the
transfer or  other similar taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger
Price  to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate 
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Escrow and  Paying
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, the Escrow and
Paying Agent shall not pay to the holders of  Company Common Shares that
portion of the Merger Price represented by  the Indemnity Escrow and the
Reimbursement Fund until such time as such  amount, if any, is distributable
pursuant to the terms and conditions  of the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement.     5    (d) Promptly following the date that the Indemnity
Escrow  Agreement terminates by its terms and the Escrow and Paying Agent 
distributes cash in an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow and the 
Reimbursement Fund, or such lesser amount as is required to be  distributed
to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders thereunder, the Escrow  and Paying Agent
shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash,  Certificates and other
documents in its possession relating to the  transactions described in this
Agreement, and the Escrow and Paying  Agent\'s duties shall terminate.
Thereafter, each holder of a  Certificate formerly representing a Company
Common Share may surrender  such Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and
(subject to  applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive
in  consideration therefor the aggregate Merger Price relating thereto, 
without any interest thereon (except as specifically provided for in  the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement).   (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on  the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any
Company  Common Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective  Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly
representing  Company Common Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the  Escrow and Paying Agent, they shall be surrendered and
cancelled in  return for the payment of the aggregate Merger Price relating
thereto,  as provided in this Article IV.   (f) None of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Holders  Representative or the Escrow and Paying Agent shall
be liable to any  Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Price
delivered to a  public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat  or similar law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to  five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such  earlier date on which the Merger Price in respect of such
Certificate  would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
public  official), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect  of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law,  become the property of the Parent, free and clear of all claims or 
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (g) In the event that
any Certificate shall have been lost,  stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by  the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed  and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such  Person of a bond in such reasonable amount, and otherwise in
such  substance and form as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct 
as indemnity against it, Parent and the Escrow and Paying Agent with  respect
to such Certificate, the Escrow and Paying Agent will issue in  exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger  Price with respect to
such Certificate to which such Person is entitled  pursuant to this Article
IV.   (h) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and  withhold,
or cause the Escrow and Paying Agent to deduct and withhold,  from the
Merger      6    Price payable to a holder of a Certificate any
withholding taxes and  such other amounts as are required under the Code or
any applicable  provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that  amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Escrow  and Paying Agent, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated  for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of  the Certificate in respect of which such deduction or withholding was 
made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Escrow and Paying Agent and Parent  shall
provide, or cause the Escrow and Paying Agent to provide, to the  holder of
such Certificate written notice of the amounts so deducted or  withheld.  
4.3 Stock Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company\'s Board
of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary to (i) provide
for the cancellation or exercise, effective at the Effective Time, of all
the outstanding stock options or similar rights (the "Options") heretofore
granted under the Equity Incentive Plan of Omega Holdings, Inc. (the "Stock
Option Plan"), without any payment therefor except as otherwise provided in
this Section 4.3, and (ii) terminate the Stock Option Plan as of the
Effective Time. Each Option, to the extent unexercised as of the Effective
Time, shall thereafter no longer be exercisable but shall entitle each holder
thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to a payment in cash by the
Company (subject to any applicable withholding taxes), at the Effective Time,
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company Common Shares as to
which that Option remains unexercised and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Price over (B) the exercise price per Company Common Share subject to
such Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the "Option
Payments"). At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Escrow and Paying Agent the aggregate Option
Payments due pursuant to this Section 4.3 (net of the aggregate principal
amount of the Management Notes plus accrued interest thereon to the Effective
Time held by holders of Options and not otherwise deducted from the Merger
Price pursuant to Section 4.2). Upon surrender of the certificate for an
Option by the holder of such Option to the Escrow and Paying Agent, the
Escrow and Paying Agent shall pay to such Option holder, on behalf of the
Company and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, the Option Payments
due under this Section 4.3 with respect to such Option. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Escrow and Paying Agent shall not pay to the Option holder
that portion of the Option Payments represented by the Indemnity Escrow and
the Reimbursement Fund until such time as such amounts are distributable
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and
(ii) the amount to be paid pursuant to this Section 4.3 to any obligor on a
Management Note in respect of the Options held by such obligor shall (solely

as applicable, before issuing any such press release or making  any such
public announcement.   6.2 Documents to be Delivered Upon Signing. On the

The respective representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in
this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and will remain in full force
and effect for the 545 day period following the Effective Time. The covenants
set forth in Articles I, II, III, IV, VII, VIII, and IX and Section 6.1 shall
survive in accordance with their terms. Neither the period of survival nor
any liability of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders pursuant to the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement with respect to the Company\'s covenants, representations
and warranties shall be reduced by any due diligence or other investigation
made by Parent or Merger Sub at any time or by the disclosure of any facts or
circumstances to Parent or Merger Sub (whether prior to or after the date of

and after the Closing Date, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall, pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, indemnify and
hold harmless Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, each of their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents (other than the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders), and each of the heirs, executors, successors and
assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Parent Indemnified
Parties") from and against any and all Losses incurred by, suffered by or
asserted against any of the Parent Indemnified Parties in connection with or
arising from (i) any breach by the Company of its covenants and agreements
contained herein, and (ii) any breach by the Company of its representations
and warranties contained herein; provided, that for purposes of this clause
(ii), other than with respect to the representations and warranties     
35   set forth in Sections 5.1(e)(i) and (ii), (g)(xviii), (o)(vii),
(p)(iii), (t)(vi), (u) and (w), if any such representation or warranty
contained herein is qualified (either directly or by the use of the defined
term "Material Adverse Effect") by the word "material" (or by any word formed
from such word), then such representation and warranty will in all respects
be construed as if the word "material" (and such words formed therefrom) were
not included in such representation or warranty or included in the definition
of "Material Adverse Effect"; provided, further, that (A) the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders shall be required to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties
only to the extent that the aggregate Losses indemnifiable pursuant to this
Section 7.2 exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Threshold") (provided,
that, subject to clauses (B) and (C) below, once such aggregate Losses exceed
the Threshold, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall be liable for the payment
of all such Losses from the first dollar thereof and not merely the amounts
in excess of the Threshold); (B) the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall not be
required to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties in an aggregate amount

Amount not paid at Closing and available for indemnity claims in accordance
with the terms of the Kitchen Craft Cash Bonus Award Agreements); and (C) no
claim for indemnification may be made after the 545 day period following the
Closing Date. The limitations described above in Section 7.2(A), (B) and (C)
shall not apply to any Losses arising from or in connection with any breach
of Sections 7.6 or 8.13. To the extent that any of the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders undertakings set forth in this Section 7.2 may be unenforceable,
each of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall, pursuant to the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, contribute the maximum amount that it is permitted under
applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
indemnifiable liabilities incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties;
provided that in no event shall any of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders be
required to contribute more than it would have been required to pay from the
Indemnity Escrow had such undertaking been enforceable. Following the
Closing, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall have no liability for breaches
of this Agreement except pursuant to this Section 7.2 and the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement.   7.3 Indemnification by Parent. From and after the
Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders, each of their respective direct and indirect partners,
directors, officers, employees and agents, and each of the heirs, executors,
successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
"Stockholder Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Losses
incurred by, suffered by or asserted against any of the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties in connection with or arising from (i) any breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of its covenants and agreements contained herein or (ii)
any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its representations and
warranties contained herein; provided, that for purposes of this clause (ii),
other than with respect to the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 5.2(f), if any such representation or warranty contained herein is
qualified (either directly or by the use of the defined term "Parent Material
Adverse Effect") by the word "material" (or by any word formed from such
word), then such representation and warranty will in all respects be
construed as if the word "material" (and such words formed therefrom) were
not included in such representation or warranty or included in the definition
of "Parent Material Adverse Effect"; provided, further, that (A) Parent shall
be required to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties only to the
extent that the aggregate      36   Losses indemnifiable pursuant to
this Section 7.3 exceed the Threshold (provided, that, subject to clauses (B)
and (C) below, once such aggregate Losses exceed the Threshold, Parent shall
be liable for the payment of all such Losses from the first dollar thereof
and not merely the amounts in excess of the Threshold); (B) Parent shall not
be required to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in an aggregate
amount in excess of $25,000,000 and (C) no claim for indemnification may be
made after the 545 day period following the Closing Date. The limitations
described in Section 7.3 (A), (B) and (C) shall not apply to any Losses
arising from or in connection with any breach of Sections 1.2(iii), 6.1(b),
7.6 or 8.13. To the extent that Parent\'s undertakings set forth in
this Section 7.3 may be unenforceable, Parent shall contribute the maximum
amount that it is permitted under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all indemnifiable liabilities incurred by the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties.   7.4 Claims Procedures.   (a) All claims under
Section 7.2 shall be made and resolved in  accordance with the procedures
provided in the Indemnity Escrow  Agreement.   (b) All claims for
indemnification under Section 7.3 involving  third party claims against
Stockholder Indemnified Parties shall be  made and resolved as hereinafter
set forth. If a claim by a third party  is made against a Stockholder
Indemnified Party, and if such  Stockholder Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnity with respect  thereto under this Article VII, such Stockholder
Indemnified Party  shall promptly notify the Parent of such claims. The
failure to provide  such notice shall not result in a waiver of any right
to  indemnification hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party 
is actually materially prejudiced by such failure. With respect to a  claim
by a Stockholder Indemnified Party, Parent shall undertake,  conduct and
control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own  expense, the
settlement or defense thereof, and the Stockholder  Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with it in connection therewith.  Parent shall not, except with the
consent of the Stockholder  Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, enter  into any settlement or consent to entry of any
judgment that (i) does  not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the Person  or Persons asserting such claim to such Stockholder
Indemnified Party  of an unconditional release from all liability with
respect to such  claim, or (ii) imposes any restriction, condition or
obligation on, or  requires any undertaking or admission by such Stockholder
Indemnified  Party.   7.5 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All
indemnification payments under this Article VII shall be treated as
adjustments to the Merger Consideration.   7.6 Directors\' and Officers\'
Indemnification.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent, the
Surviving  Corporation and the Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted  under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each present
and  former director or      37    officer of the Company and of each
Subsidiary of the Company and each  such person who served at the request of
the Company or any Subsidiary  of the Company as a director, officer,
trustee, partner, fiduciary,  employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture,  trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise  (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties") against all
costs and  expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys\'
fees),  judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
settlement  amounts paid in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or  investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time),  whether civil, administrative, criminal or investigative, arising
out  of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as 
officers or directors, in each case occurring at or before the  Effective
Time (including without limitation the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement), in each case, to the fullest extent  permitted by the DGCL or any
other applicable laws or to the fullest  extent permitted under the
Company\'s certificate of incorporation and  bylaws or any applicable
contract or agreement as in effect on the date  hereof). Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event of any such  claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (i) the Company,  Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall pay the  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected
by any Company  Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be Ropes and Gray or
other counsel  reasonably satisfactory to the Company, Parent or the
Surviving  Corporation, as the case may be, promptly after statements
therefor are  received (unless the Surviving Corporation shall elect to
defend such  action) and (ii) the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation  shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however,  that neither the Company, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be  liable for any settlement effected without its written consent
(which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Notwithstanding  anything else in this Section 7.6 to the contrary, in no
event shall  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company be obligated
to  indemnify any Company Indemnified Party for any loss incurred by a 
Company Indemnified Party arising from any claim by the Principal 
Stockholder or any partner, fiduciary, employee, officer or agent 
thereof.   (b) For a period of at least six years after the Effective 
Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation of the  Surviving
Corporation to continue to include a provision substantially  similar to
Articles 8 and 9 of the Certificate of Incorporation of the  Company for the
benefit of all directors and officers of the Company  and each Subsidiary of
the Company prior to the Effective Time. In the  event that any claim or
claims for indemnification are asserted or made  within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification in respect  of any such claim or claims shall
continue until the disposition of any  and all such claims.   (c) For a
period of three years after the Effective Time,  Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current directors\'  and officers\' liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company  (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies reasonably  satisfactory to the Company
Indemnified Parties of at least the same  coverage containing terms and
conditions that, in the      38    aggregate, are no less
advantageous) with respect to claims arising  from facts or events that
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time;  provided, however, that in no
event shall Parent be required to expend  pursuant to this Section 7.6(c)
more than an amount per year equal to  150% of current annual premiums paid
by the Company and its  Subsidiaries for such insurance; provided, further,
however, that if  the premium for such coverage exceeds such amount, Parent
or the  Surviving Corporation shall purchase a policy with the greatest 
coverage available for such 150% of the amount per annum spent by the 
Company and its Subsidiaries for their fiscal year ending December 29, 
2001.   (d) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or  any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or  merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or  surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)  transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any  Person, then, and
in each case, proper provision shall be made so that  the successors and
assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation,  as the case may be,
honor the indemnification and other obligations set  forth in this Section
7.6.   ARTICLE VIII  MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL   8.1 Payment of Expenses;
