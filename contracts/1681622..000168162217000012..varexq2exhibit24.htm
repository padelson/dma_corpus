mutually agreed upon by PKI and Buyer) (the "PKI Shanghai Bill of Sale and
Assignment and Assumption Agreement") and (ii) such other instruments of
conveyance as Buyer may reasonably request in order to effect the sale,

Sublease Agreement");

1.4 Amendment to Section 1.3(b)(xv). Section 1.3(b)(xv) of the MPSA is hereby

1.5 Amendment to Section 5.1(a). Section 5.1(a) of the MPSA is hereby amended
and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

(a) PKI shall have (i) obtained (or caused to be obtained) all of the waivers,
permits, consents, approvals or other authorizations and effected all of the
registrations, filings and notices (collectively, the "Consents") listed on
Schedule 5.1(a) attached hereto, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer and (ii) delivered evidence to Buyer that such Consent was obtained;
provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, a written consent to the

1.6 Amendment to Section 6.5. Section 6.5 of the MPSA is hereby amended to
include a new Section 6.5(i), which shall read as follows:

(i) In no event shall Buyer's or PKI's rights to, or defenses against, any
claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement
be affected or limited in any way by the terms of that certain Deed of
Novation of Contract, by and among Elekta Limited, PKI and Varex Imaging
Corporation, and, for purposes of determining the rights of Varex Imaging
Corporation under this sentence and under this Agreement, the release set
forth in Section 2.2 of the Deed of Novation of Contract shall be disregarded.
Without limiting the foregoing, PKI shall, in accordance with the provisions
of Sections 6.3, 6.4, 6.5(a), 6.5(c) through 6.5(h) and 6.6 of the MPSA,
indemnify, compensate and reimburse Varex Imaging 

Corporation for any Damages Varex Imaging Corporation or any of its Affiliates
suffer as a result of any fact, circumstance, event or action arising,
existing or taken prior to the Closing under or in connection with the
Contract (as such term is defined in the Deed of Novation of Contract),
including as a result of any breach of the Contract prior to the Closing and
any claims or other legal proceedings made by Elekta Limited against Varex
Imaging Corporation or any of its Affiliates relating thereto, again
disregarding Section 2.2 of the Deed of Novation of Contract. By way of
example of the foregoing, if Elekta Limited or PKI was in breach of the
Contract prior to the Closing, any Damages resulting therefrom or claims or
legal proceedings by Elekta Limited or its Affiliates against Varex Imaging
Corporation or any of its Affiliates relating thereto shall be subject to the
indemnification, compensation and reimbursement obligations under this Section
6 notwithstanding the release set forth in Section 2.2 of the Deed of Novation
of Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6: (A) the
aggregate liability of PKI with respect to Damages relating to the matters
referred to in the second sentence of this Section 6.5(i), together with other
matters that are subject to the $20,700,000 liability cap set forth in Section
6.5(b)(i), shall not exceed an amount equal to $20,700,000; (B) no individual
claim or series of related claims for indemnification under the second
sentence of this Section 6.5(i) shall be valid and assertable unless it is (or
they are) for an amount in excess of $25,000; and (C) PKI shall be liable
under the second sentence of this Section 6.5(i) only for that portion of
aggregate Damages that exceeds $1,000,000 (it being understood that (1) PKI
shall not be liable, in any event, for the first $1,000,000 of said Damages
and (2) any Damages with respect to claims made under the second sentence of
this Section 6.5(i) shall be taken into account for purposes of the deductible
set forth in Section 6.5(b)(iii)).
