ARTICLE II

Merger and without any action on the part of HoldCo, Trulia or the holders of
any Trulia Common Stock or HoldCo Common Stock:

of Trulia Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.01(a)(ii)) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.444 of a share
(the " _Trulia Exchange Ratio_ ") of fully paid and nonassessable HoldCo Class
A Common Stock (the " _Trulia Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of
Trulia Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Trulia Common
Stock (each, a " _Trulia Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Trulia Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock to
be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Zillow-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Trulia Common Stock that is owned by Trulia as treasury stock and each share
of Trulia Common Stock that is owned by HoldCo, Zillow or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Zillow or Trulia immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Trulia Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Trulia Merger Sub (the " _Trulia
Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the Trulia Surviving
Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Trulia Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing shares of Trulia Merger Sub Common Stock shall
be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock
of the Trulia Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(iv) _Appraisal Rights/Dissenting Shares_. In accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of shares of
Trulia Common Stock in connection with the Trulia Merger.

(b)  _Capital Stock of Zillow_. At the Initial Effective Time, by virtue of
the Zillow Merger and without any action on the part of HoldCo, Zillow or the
holders of any Zillow Common Stock or HoldCo Common Stock:

 

(i) _Conversion of Zillow Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02, (i) each
share of Zillow Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Initial Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.01(b)(ii) and the Dissenting Zillow Shares) shall be converted
into the 

 



4  right to receive one share (the " _Zillow Class A Exchange Ratio_") of
fully paid and nonassessable HoldCo Class A Common Stock (the " _Zillow Class
A Merger Consideration_") and (ii) each share of Class B Zillow Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time (other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)(ii) and the
Dissenting Zillow Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive one
share (the " _Zillow Class B Exchange Ratio_", together with the Trulia
Exchange Ratio and the Zillow Class A Exchange Ratio, the " _Exchange Ratios_
") of fully paid and nonassessable HoldCo Class B Common Stock (the " _Zillow
Class B Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Trulia Merger
Consideration and the Zillow Class A Merger Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All such shares of Zillow Common Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in
book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time
represented any such shares of Zillow Common Stock (each, a " _Zillow
Certificate_ " and, together with the Trulia Certificates, the "
_Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Zillow Class A Merger Consideration or the Zillow
Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders become entitled upon the surrender of such Zillow Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

(ii) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Trulia-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Zillow Common Stock that is owned by Zillow as treasury stock and each share
of Zillow Common Stock that is owned by HoldCo, Trulia or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Zillow or Trulia immediately prior to the
Initial Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Trulia Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Zillow Merger Sub (the " _Zillow
Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Initial Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the
Zillow Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Zillow Surviving Corporation. From and after the Initial
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Zillow Merger Sub
Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Zillow Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(iv) _Appraisal Rights/Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Zillow Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time and
held by a shareholder who shall have neither voted in favor of the Zillow
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and
validly demanded its rights to be paid the fair value of such shares in
accordance with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (" _Dissenting_ Zillow _Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(i). By virtue of the Zillow Merger,
all Dissenting Zillow Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
the holders of such Dissenting Zillow Shares shall thereafter be entitled
only to such rights with respect to such Dissenting Zillow Shares as are
provided under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Zillow Shares held by
a shareholder who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such shareholders right to dissent under such Chapter
23B.13 of the WBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and
to have become exchangeable for, the right to receive (A) the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Zillow Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(i) and (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d), without any
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate(s) (or shares of Zillow
Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with this Article II.

 



5 (c) _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Zillow
Common Stock or Trulia Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of
shares of Zillow Common Stock or Trulia Common Stock, as the case may be,
will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Zillow Common
Stock and Trulia Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence
shall not be construed to permit Zillow or Trulia to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
As and to the extent provided in Section 2.02(i), the right of any holder of
a Certificate to receive Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced
by the amount of any withholding under applicable tax Law.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the
Initial Effective Time, HoldCo shall appoint Computershare, Inc. to act as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration. At or prior to the Initial Effective Time, HoldCo shall cause
to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the
Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of HoldCo Common Stock to
be issued as Merger Consideration and cash sufficient to make payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f). All such HoldCo Common
Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, HoldCo shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock a form of letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry form) as Zillow or HoldCo may specify subject to
Trulias reasonable approval prior to the Initial Effective Time), together
with instructions thereto.

 

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in
the case of shares of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock represented
by a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow
Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of
Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock have been converted pursuant
to Section 2.01 and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of
any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Trulia or Zillow, as applicable, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.01 and cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends
or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock (or, if such Trulia Common
Stock or Zillow Common Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of
such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share of Trulia Common Stock
and Zillow Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be
deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the
holders of shares of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock were entitled
to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to 

 



6  Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.02(d)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Trulia Common
Stock or Zillow Common Stock held in book-entry form).

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to HoldCo Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered

book-entry form) with respect to the shares of HoldCo Common Stock issuable
upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender
of such Certificate (or shares of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock
held in book-entry form) in accordance with this Article II. Subject to
escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or shares of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock held in
book-entry form), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of HoldCo Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of HoldCo Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of HoldCo Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of HoldCo Common Stock.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common
Stock_. The shares of HoldCo Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance
with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Trulia
Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to
Section 2.02(f)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Trulia Common Stock or
Zillow Common Stock. From and after (i) the Initial Effective Time with
respect to shares of Zillow Common Stock and (ii) the Effective Time with
respect to shares of Trulia Common Stock, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporations of shares of Zillow Common Stock or Trulia Common
Stock, as applicable, that were outstanding immediately prior to the Initial
Effective Time or the Effective Time, as applicable. If, after (x) the Initial
Effective Time with respect to shares of Zillow Common Stock and (y) the
Effective Time with respect to shares of Trulia Common Stock, any Certificates
formerly representing shares of Zillow Common Stock or Trulia Common Stock (or
shares of Zillow Common Stock or Trulia Common Stock held in book-entry form)
are presented to HoldCo, a Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of HoldCo Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Trulia
Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Trulia Common
Stock or Zillow Common Stock converted pursuant to the Mergers who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of HoldCo Common
Stock (after taking into account all shares of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow
Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by
the last reported sale price of Zillow Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Zillow
and Trulia) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the
Effective Time.

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common
Stock for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to HoldCo and
any holder of Trulia Common Stock or Zillow Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
HoldCo for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Article II, in each case without any interest
thereon.



 



7 (h) _No Liability_. None of Trulia, Zillow, HoldCo or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates for two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of HoldCo, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(i)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of HoldCo and the Exchange Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Zillow Common Stock, Trulia Common Stock,
Trulia Stock Options or Trulia RSUs pursuant to this Agreement any amounts
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Zillow Common Stock,
Trulia Common Stock, Trulia Stock Option or Trulia RSU in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
HoldCo, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as HoldCo may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
dividends and distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 2.03. _Trulia Stock Options_. (a) All options of Trulia (the "
_Trulia Stock Options_ ") outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable and whether or not vested, that were issued under Trulias 2005
Stock Incentive Plan or Trulias 2012 Equity Incentive Plan or the Market
Leader Amended and Restated 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the "
_Trulia Stock Plans_ "), shall remain outstanding following the Effective
Time. At the Effective Time, Trulia Stock Options shall be assumed by HoldCo
in such manner that HoldCo (i) is a corporation "assuming a stock option in a
transaction to which Section 424(a) applies" within the meaning of Section 424
of the Code and the regulations thereunder or (ii) to the extent that Section
424 of the Code does not apply to any such Trulia Stock Options, would be such
a corporation were Section 424 of the Code applicable to such Trulia Stock
Options. From and after the Effective Time, all references to Trulia in
Trulia Stock Plans and the applicable stock option agreements issued
thereunder shall be deemed to refer to HoldCo, which shall have assumed Trulia
Stock Plans as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement. Each
Trulia Stock Option to be assumed by HoldCo (each, a " _Substitute Trulia
Option_ ") shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under
the applicable Trulia Stock Plan and the applicable option agreement issued
thereunder, except that (A) each such Substitute Trulia Option shall be
exercisable for, and represent the right to acquire, that whole number of
shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the number of shares of Trulia Common Stock subject to such
Trulia Stock Option multiplied by the Trulia Exchange Ratio; and (B) the
option price per share of HoldCo Class A Common Stock shall be an amount equal
to the option price per share of Trulia Common Stock subject to such Trulia
Stock Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Trulia Exchange Ratio (the option price per share, as so determined, being
rounded upward to the nearest full cent). Such Substitute Trulia Option shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Trulia Stock
Option. All outstanding unvested Trulia Stock Options held by a member of
Trulia Board who is not an employee of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary (an "
_Outside Director Trulia Stock Option_ ") shall become fully vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, HoldCo shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Trulia Option an
appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and
such Substitute Trulia Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (including any

 



8  antidilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 2.03 after giving effect to the Mergers). HoldCo shall comply with the
terms of all such Substitute Trulia Options and ensure, to the extent
required by, and subject to the provisions of, Trulia Stock Plans, that
Substitute Trulia Options that qualified as incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as
incentive stock options after the Effective Time. HoldCo shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Substitute
Trulia Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 2.03. As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than 10 days),
the shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock subject to Substitute Trulia Options
will be covered by an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) or another appropriate form, and HoldCo shall use its
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements for so long as Substitute Trulia Options
remain outstanding. In addition, HoldCo shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause the shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock subject to Substitute Trulia
Options to be quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other
exchanges as HoldCo shall determine.

SECTION 2.04. _Trulia Restricted Stock Units_. All restricted stock units of
Trulia (" _Trulia RSUs_ ") outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not
vested, that were issued under Trulia Stock Plans, shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Trulia RSU shall
be assumed by HoldCo and converted into the right to receive the number of
shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock (each, an " _Assumed Trulia RSU_ ").
Each Assumed Trulia RSU will be subject to, and vested on, the same terms
and conditions applicable to such Assumed Trulia RSU (including under the
terms of the applicable Trulia Stock Plan, the applicable restricted stock
unit agreement and any other applicable Trulia Plan) as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed Trulia RSU will constitute an
Assumed Trulia RSU to acquire the number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Trulia Common Stock subject to
such Assumed Trulia RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the
Trulia Exchange Ratio. Each outstanding unvested Trulia RSU held by a member
of Trulia Board who is not an employee of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary (an
" _Outside Director Trulia RSU_ ") shall become fully vested immediately prior
to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, HoldCo
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of an Assumed Trulia
RSU an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto
and such Assumed Trulia RSU shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (including any antidilution provisions, and subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.04 after giving effect to the Mergers).
HoldCo shall comply with the terms of all such Assumed Trulia RSUs. HoldCo
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock for delivery
upon the vesting of Assumed Trulia RSUs pursuant to the terms set forth in
this Section 2.04. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event more than 10 days), the shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock subject
to Assumed Trulia RSUs will be covered by an effective registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form, and HoldCo
shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements for so long as Assumed
Trulia RSUs remain outstanding. In addition, HoldCo shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause the shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock subject to Assumed
Trulia RSUs to be quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other
exchanges as HoldCo shall determine.

 

SECTION 2.05. _Trulia Stock Appreciation Rights_. All stock appreciation
rights (the " _Trulia SARs_ ") outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or
not exercisable and whether or not vested, that were issued under the Trulia
Stock Plans, shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and shall
be assumed by HoldCo as of the Effective Time. Each Trulia SAR to be assumed
by HoldCo (each, a " _Substitute Trulia SAR_ ") shall be exercisable upon the
same terms and conditions as under the applicable Trulia Stock Plan and the
applicable stock appreciation rights agreement issued thereunder, except that
(A) the number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock subject to each
Substitute Trulia SAR shall be equal to that whole number of shares of HoldCo
Class A Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to
the number of shares of Trulia Common Stock subject to such Trulia SAR
multiplied by the Trulia Exchange Ratio; and (B) the exercise price

 



9  per share of HoldCo Class A Common Stock shall be an amount equal to the
exercise price per share of Trulia Common Stock subject to such Trulia SAR in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Trulia Exchange
Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so determined, being rounded upward to
the nearest full cent). Such Substitute Trulia SAR shall otherwise be subject
to the same terms and conditions as such Trulia SAR. The assumption of
Substitute Trulia SARs pursuant to this Section shall be effected in a manner
that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section 2.05 will be construed
consistent with this intent. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
HoldCo shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute
Trulia SAR an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant
thereto and such Substitute Trulia SAR shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (including any antidilution provisions, and subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 2.05 after giving effect to the
Mergers). HoldCo shall comply with the terms of all such Substitute Trulia
SARs. HoldCo shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of Substitute Trulia SARs pursuant to the terms set
forth in this Section 2.05. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event more than 10 days), the shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock
subject to Substitute Trulia SARs will be covered by an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form, and HoldCo shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements for
so long as Substitute Trulia SARs remain outstanding. In addition, HoldCo
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the shares of HoldCo Class A Common
Stock subject to Substitute Trulia SARs to be quoted on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market or any other exchanges as HoldCo shall determine.

SECTION 2.06. _Zillow Stock Options_. (a) All options of Zillow (the "
_Zillow Stock Options_ ") outstanding at the Initial Effective Time, whether
or not exercisable and whether or not vested, that were issued under Zillows
Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and Zillows Amended and
Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Zillow Stock Plans_
"), shall remain outstanding following the Initial Effective Time. At the
Initial Effective Time, the Zillow Stock Options shall be assumed by HoldCo
in such manner that HoldCo (i) is a corporation "assuming a stock option in a
transaction to which Section 424(a) applies" within the meaning of Section 424
of the Code and the regulations thereunder or (ii) to the extent that Section
424 of the Code does not apply to any such Zillow Stock Options, would be such
a corporation were Section 424 of the Code applicable to such Zillow Stock
Options. From and after the Initial Effective Time, all references to Zillow
in the Zillow Stock Plans and the applicable stock option agreements issued
thereunder shall be deemed to refer to HoldCo, which shall have assumed the
Zillow Stock Plans as of the Initial Effective Time by virtue of this
Agreement. Each Zillow Stock Option to be assumed by HoldCo (each, a "
_Substitute Zillow Option_ ") shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as under the applicable Zillow Stock Plan and the applicable
option agreement issued thereunder, except that (A) each such Substitute
Zillow Option shall be exercisable for, and represent the right to acquire,
that whole number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of Zillow Common Stock
subject to such Zillow Stock Option multiplied by the Zillow Class A Exchange
Ratio; and (B) the option price per share of HoldCo Class A Common Stock shall
be an amount equal to the option price per share of Zillow Common Stock
subject to such Zillow Stock Option in effect immediately prior to the Initial
Effective Time divided by the Zillow Class A Exchange Ratio (the option price
per share, as so determined, being rounded upward to the nearest full cent).
Such Substitute Zillow Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions as such Zillow Stock Option.

 

(b) As soon as practicable after the Initial Effective Time, HoldCo shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Zillow
Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant
thereto and such Substitute Zillow Option shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (including any antidilution provisions, and subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 2.06 after giving effect to the
Mergers). HoldCo shall comply with the terms of all such Substitute Zillow
Options and ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions
of, the Zillow Stock Plans, that Substitute Zillow Options that qualified as
incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Initial
Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options after the
Initial Effective Time. HoldCo shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common
Stock for

 



10  delivery upon exercise of Substitute Zillow Options pursuant to the terms
set forth in this Section 2.06. As soon as practicable after the Initial
Effective Time (but in no event more than 10 days), the shares of HoldCo
Class A Common Stock subject to Substitute Zillow Options will be covered by
an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or
another appropriate form, and HoldCo shall use its reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements for so long as Substitute Zillow Options remain outstanding. In
addition, HoldCo shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
HoldCo Class A Common Stock subject to Substitute Zillow Options to be quoted
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other exchanges as HoldCo shall
determine.

 

SECTION 2.07. _Zillow Restricted Stock Units_. All restricted stock units of
Zillow (" _Zillow RSUs_ ") outstanding at the Initial Effective Time, whether
or not vested, that were issued under the Zillow Stock Plans, shall remain
outstanding following the Initial Effective Time. At the Initial Effective
Time, each Zillow RSU shall be assumed by HoldCo and converted into the right
to receive the number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock (each, an "
_Assumed Zillow RSU_ "). Each Assumed Zillow RSU will be subject to, and
vested on, the same terms and conditions applicable to such Assumed Zillow
RSU (including under the terms of the applicable Zillow Stock Plan, the
applicable restricted stock unit agreement and any other applicable Zillow
Plan) as of immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time, except that each
Assumed Zillow RSU will constitute an Assumed Zillow RSU to acquire the
number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of
shares of Zillow Common Stock subject to such Assumed Zillow RSU immediately
prior to the Initial Effective Time by (ii) the Zillow Class A Exchange Ratio.
As soon as practicable after the Initial Effective Time, HoldCo shall deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to each holder of an Assumed Zillow RSU an
appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and
such Substitute Zillow Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (including any antidilution provisions, and subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.07 after giving effect to the Mergers).
HoldCo shall comply with the terms of all such Assumed Zillow RSUs. HoldCo
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock for delivery
upon the vesting of Assumed Zillow RSUs pursuant to the terms set forth in
this Section 2.07. As soon as practicable after the Initial Effective Time
(but in no event more than 10 days), the shares of HoldCo Class A Common
Stock subject to Assumed Zillow RSUs will be covered by an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form, and HoldCo shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements for so
long as Assumed Zillow RSUs remain outstanding. In addition, HoldCo shall use
all reasonable efforts to cause the shares of HoldCo Class A Common Stock
subject to Assumed Zillow RSUs to be quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
or any other exchanges as HoldCo shall determine.

 

SECTION 2.08. _Zillow Restricted Stock_. If any shares of Zillow Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time are unvested or
are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
under the Zillow Stock Plans or any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with Zillow, then the shares of HoldCo Class
A Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Zillow Common Stock (the
" _Exchanged Zillow Restricted Stock_ ") will also be unvested and subject to

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule that has been prepared by
Trulia and delivered to Zillow in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement (the " _Trulia Disclosure Schedule_ ") or as disclosed in
any Trulia SEC Report filed and publicly available after December 31, 2012 and
at least five business days prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding

jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not constitute a Trulia Material Adverse Effect. Each of Trulia and

to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such

constitute a Trulia Material Adverse Effect.

 



12 (b) A true and complete list of all Trulia Subsidiaries, together with the
jurisdiction of incorporation of each Trulia Subsidiary and, to the extent
not wholly-owned (directly or indirectly) by Trulia, the percentage of the

Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary. Section 3.03(b) of Trulia
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following information with respect to each
Trulia Stock Option, Trulia RSU and Trulia SAR outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement: (i) the name and address of the optionee or grantee; (ii) the

stock of any Trulia Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make any investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Trulia
Subsidiary or any other person. Except with respect to Outside Director Trulia
Stock Options and Outside Director Trulia RSUs, there are no commitments
or agreements of any character to which Trulia is bound obligating Trulia to
accelerate the vesting of any Trulia Stock Option, Trulia RSU or Trulia SAR as
a result of the Mergers. All outstanding shares of Trulia Common Stock, all
outstanding Trulia Stock Options, all outstanding Trulia RSUs, all
outstanding

 



13  Trulia SARs and all outstanding shares of capital stock of each subsidiary

charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

 

SECTION 3.04. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. (a) Trulia
has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Trulia
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (subject, in the case of
the Trulia Merger, to receipt of Trulia Stockholder Approval and the filing
and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Trulia and the consummation by
Trulia of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Trulia are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect
to the Trulia Merger, Trulia Stockholder Approval and the filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Trulia and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Zillow and HoldCo,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Trulia, enforceable
against Trulia in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws
relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and subject to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity).

 

(b) The Trulia Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary, as of the
date hereof, to render any Takeover Law inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Trulia Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

SECTION 3.05. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. (a) The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Trulia do not, and the performance of this
Agreement by Trulia will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws or any equivalent organizational documents of Trulia
or any Trulia Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in Section 3.05(b) have been
obtained and all filings and obligations described in Section 3.05(b) have
been made, conflict with or violate any United States or non-United States
statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive order, injunction,
judgment, decree or other order (" _Law_ ") applicable to Trulia or any
Trulia Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of Trulia or any Trulia
Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of Trulia or
any Trulia Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary is a party or by which
Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary or any of their assets or properties is bound
or affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not
constitute a Trulia Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Trulia do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by Trulia will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
United States federal, state, county or local or non-United States government,
governmental, regulatory or administrative authority, agency, instrumentality
or commission or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (a "
_Governmental Authority_ "), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any,
of the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_
") and state takeover laws, the pre-merger notification

 



14  requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not constitute a Trulia Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.06. _Permits; Compliance_. Each of Trulia and Trulia Subsidiaries is
in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of Trulia or Trulia
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted (the " _Trulia Permits_ "), except
where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of Trulia
Permits would not constitute a Trulia Material Adverse Effect. No suspension
or cancellation of any of Trulia Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Trulia, threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, any of Trulia Permits would not constitute a Trulia Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Trulia nor any Trulia Subsidiary is in conflict with,
or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to Trulia or any
Trulia Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of Trulia or any Trulia
Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (b) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, Trulia Permit, franchise or other

or by which Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary or any property or asset of
Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary is bound, except for any such conflicts,
defaults, breaches or violations that would not constitute a Trulia Material
Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.07. _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_. (a) Trulia has timely
furnished or filed all forms, reports and documents required to be furnished
or filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
since September 19, 2012 (collectively, the " _Trulia SEC Reports_ "). Each
Trulia SEC Report (i) was, at the time filed, prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_
"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and (ii) did not, at the time filed, or, if amended or superseded by an
amendment or filing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of
such amendment or filing, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. No Trulia Subsidiary is required
to file any form, report or other document with the SEC.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in Trulia SEC Reports was prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may

permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Trulia and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise
noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments).

 

(c) Except (i) as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance
sheet of Trulia and the consolidated Trulia Subsidiaries as at March 31,

since March 31, 2014, (iii) for liabilities to pay or perform under
any Material Trulia Contract set forth on Section 3.16(a) of Trulia
Disclosure Schedule or entered into after the date hereof in compliance with
Section 5.01 in accordance with its terms and without any breach of any
provision thereof, and (iv) for liabilities and obligations incurred as
permitted by this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, neither Trulia nor any Trulia Subsidiary has
any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would constitute a Trulia Material Adverse
Effect.

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Trulia and the principal
financial officer of Trulia (or each former principal executive officer of
Trulia and each former principal financial officer of Trulia, as applicable)

 



15  has made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to Trulia
SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and

"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
SOX. None of Trulia or any of Trulia Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

 

(e) Trulia maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"

to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance with
the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Trulias
properties or assets that could have a material effect on Trulias financial
statements. 

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Trulia are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Trulia in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Trulia, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of Zillow to make the certifications required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 

(g) Since December 31, 2012, none of Trulia, Trulias independent accountants,
Trulia Board or the audit committee of Trulia Board has received any oral or
written notification of any (i) "significant deficiency" in the internal
control over financial reporting of Trulia, (ii) "material weakness" in the
internal control over financial reporting of Trulia or (iii) fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees of Trulia who
have a significant role in the internal control over financial reporting of
Trulia. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in Auditing
Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice, (b)
there has not been a Trulia Material Adverse Effect, and (c) none of Trulia
or any Trulia Subsidiary has taken any action that, if taken after the date of
this Agreement, would constitute a material breach of any of the covenants set

SECTION 3.09. _Absence of Litigation_. There is no litigation, suit, claim,
action, proceeding or investigation (an " _Action_ ") pending or, to the
Knowledge of Trulia, threatened against Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary, or
any property or asset of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary, before any
Governmental Authority that would constitute a Trulia Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Trulia nor any Trulia Subsidiary nor any material property or
asset of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary is subject to any continuing order
of, consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar written
agreement with, or, to the Knowledge of Trulia, continuing investigation by,
any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award of any Governmental Authority, that would constitute a
Trulia Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.10. _Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) Section 3.10(a) of Trulia
Disclosure Schedule lists all Trulia Plans. With respect to each Trulia Plan,
Trulia has made available to Zillow a true and complete copy, if applicable,
of (i) each Trulia Plan, (ii) the most recently filed Internal Revenue Service

relating to a Trulia Plan.

 

(b) Neither Trulia nor any Trulia Subsidiary is a party to, or has made any
contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under,
any "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") or
any "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413(c) of the
Code.

(c) Neither Trulia nor any Trulia Subsidiary currently maintains, sponsors,
participates in or contributes to, or has ever maintained, established,
sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Mergers could, either alone or in combination with another event, (i)
result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any current or former employee, director, officer or independent
contractor of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary or result in severance pay or
any material increase in severance pay (other than severance pay required by
any Law) to any current or former employee, director, officer or independent
contractor of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment, vesting or funding, or materially increase the amount or value of any
benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any
such employee, director, officer or independent contractor of Trulia or any
Trulia Subsidiary or (iii) obligate Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary to pay any
amount or provide any benefit, in either case, pursuant to a Contract or
Trulia Plan in effect as of the date immediately preceding the date of
this Agreement, that could, individually or in combination with any other
such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code that would constitute a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Trulia nor any Trulia Subsidiary has any indemnity obligation on or
after the date of this Agreement for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or
409A of the Code. To the Knowledge of Trulia, no amounts previously deducted
under Section 162(m) of the Code are subject to disallowance. No Trulia Plan
is subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or a
political subdivision thereof.

 

(e) Each Trulia Plan is operated in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, including, without
limitation, ERISA and the Code. Trulia and Trulia Subsidiaries have performed
all obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in any
material respect in default under or in violation of, and have no Knowledge of
any default or violation by any party to, any Trulia Plan. No Action is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Trulia, threatened with respect to any Trulia
Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and, to the
Knowledge of Trulia, no fact or event exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such Action.

(f) Each Trulia Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to
Trulia Plan for which determination letters are currently available that
Trulia Plan is so qualified and each trust established in connection with any
Trulia Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS
that it is so exempt, and to the Knowledge of Trulia, no fact or event has
occurred since the date of such determination letter or letters from the IRS
to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Trulia Plan or the exempt
status of any such trust. 

(g) Each Trulia Plan that is or forms part of a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been
operated in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code
and the guidance issued thereunder. The exercise price of each outstanding
Trulia Stock Option was equal to or greater than the fair market value of a
share of Trulia Common Stock on the applicable grant date.



 



17 (h) All current directors, officers, management employees, and technical and
professional employees of Trulia and Trulia Subsidiaries are under an
enforceable written obligation to Trulia and Trulia Subsidiaries to maintain
in confidence all confidential or proprietary information acquired by them in
the course of their employment and to assign to Trulia and Trulia
Subsidiaries all inventions made by them within the scope of their employment
during such employment and for a reasonable period thereafter

 

SECTION 3.11. _Labor and Employment Matters_. Except as would not constitute a
Trulia Material Adverse Effect, there are no controversies pending or, to the
Knowledge of Trulia, threatened between Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary and
any of their respective employees. Neither Trulia nor any Trulia Subsidiary is
a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract
applicable to persons employed by Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary, nor, to the
Knowledge of Trulia, are there any activities or proceedings of any labor
union to organize any such employees. Except as would not constitute a Trulia
Material Adverse Effect, (a) Trulia and Trulia Subsidiaries are in compliance
with all applicable Laws relating to the employment of labor, including those
related to wages, hours and the payment and withholding of taxes and other
sums as required by the appropriate Governmental Authority and have withheld
and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority or are holding for payment
not yet due to such Governmental Authority all amounts required to be withheld
from employees of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary and are not liable for any
arrears of wages, taxes, penalties or other sums for failure to comply with
any of the foregoing; (b) each individual who renders (or any other individual
who previously rendered) services to Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary who is
or was classified by Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary as having the status of
independent contractor or other non-employee status for any purpose (including
for purposes of benefit eligibility, taxation and tax reporting) is currently
or was previously properly characterized; and (c) there is no charge of
discrimination in employment or employment practices, for any reason,
including, without limitation, age, gender, race, religion or other
legally protected category, which has been asserted or is now pending or, to
the Knowledge of Trulia, threatened before the United States Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, or any other Governmental Authority in any
jurisdiction in which Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary has employed or employs
any person.

SECTION 3.12. _Property and Leases_. (a) Trulia and Trulia Subsidiaries have
sufficient title to all their properties and assets to conduct their
respective businesses as currently conducted, with only such exceptions as
would not constitute a Trulia Material Adverse Effect. The properties and

of a third party, to the extent collected by, held by, or provided to, Zillow
or any Zillow Subsidiary.

(l) Zillow Products are free from any defect, bug or programming, design or
documentation error or disrupting, disabling, harming or corrupting code that
would constitute a Zillow Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Zillow,
none of the Zillow Products contain any "back door," "drop dead device,"
"time bomb" that would constitute a Zillow Material Adverse Effect, "Trojan
horse," "virus" or "worm" (as such terms are commonly understood in the
software industry) or any other similar malicious code.

SECTION 4.14. _Taxes_. Except as would not constitute a Zillow Material
Adverse Effect, Zillow and the Zillow Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed
(taking into account any extension of time within which to file) all Returns
required to be filed by them, and all Taxes which are due and payable by
Zillow and the Zillow Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Return as
owing) have been duly and timely paid. All such Returns are true, accurate and
complete in all material respects. There are no audits, examinations, requests
for information or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Zillow,
threatened in writing, in respect of

 



32  Taxes of Zillow or the Zillow Subsidiaries. All material Tax deficiencies
asserted or assessed against Zillow or the Zillow Subsidiaries have been paid
or finally settled with no remaining amounts owed. Neither Zillow nor any
Zillow Subsidiary has granted any waiver of any statute of limitations with
respect to, or any extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax. The
accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the consolidated balance sheet
of Zillow and the consolidated Zillow Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2014 are
adequate to satisfy all liabilities for Taxes relating to Zillow and the
Zillow Subsidiaries for all periods through the Effective Time. There are no
Tax liens upon any property or assets of Zillow or any of the Zillow
Subsidiaries except liens for current Taxes not yet due and for which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP. Neither Zillow nor any
of the Zillow Subsidiaries is required, or has agreed, to make any adjustment
pursuant to Section 481 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law) by reason of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated
by Zillow or any of the Zillow Subsidiaries, and no Tax Authority has
initiated or proposed in writing any such adjustment or change in accounting
method, in either case which adjustment or change could reasonably be expected
to have a Zillow Material Adverse Effect. Neither Zillow nor any Zillow
Subsidiary has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"
in a distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(e) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) within the past five years.
None of Zillow, any Zillow Subsidiary, nor any of their affiliates has taken
or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Mergers from qualifying as
reorganizations within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Zillow has
no Knowledge any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that would
prevent the Mergers from qualifying as reorganizations within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

SECTION 4.15. _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not constitute a Zillow
Material Adverse Effect, (a) none of Zillow or any Zillow Subsidiary has
violated or is in violation of any Environmental Law and (b) Zillow and the
Zillow Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and other authorizations
required under any Environmental Law and Zillow and the Zillow Subsidiaries
are in compliance with such permits, licenses and other authorizations.

(iv) the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any event or circumstance relating to Zillow or HoldCo, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by Zillow which should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or
Joint Proxy Statement, Zillow shall promptly inform Trulia. Zillow covenants
to Trulia that all documents that Zillow or HoldCo is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will comply as to form and substance in
all material aspects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

the time the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of Trulia and the shareholders
of Zillow, (iii) the time of each of the Special Meetings and (iv) the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which

any event or circumstance relating to Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary, or
their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by Trulia which
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration
Statement or Joint Proxy Statement, Trulia shall promptly inform Zillow.
Trulia covenants to Zillow that all documents that Trulia is responsible for
filing with the SEC in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

SECTION 6.02. _Special Meetings_. (a) Trulia shall duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold Trulia Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable for
the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement. Zillow shall duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Zillow Shareholders Meeting as
promptly as practicable for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this
Agreement. Each of Trulia and Zillow shall use its reasonable best efforts to
hold the Special Meetings on the same day as soon as practicable (and in any
event within 45 days) after the date on which the Registration Statement
becomes effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each of Trulia and
Zillow may adjourn or postpone its Special Meeting to the extent necessary to
ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement
is provided to its stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, in advance of
a vote on the adoption or approval, as applicable, of this Agreement, (ii)
Trulia may adjourn or postpone its Special Meeting if, as of the time for
which such Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint
Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
Special Meeting, and

 



40  (iii) Zillow shall adjourn or postpone its Special Meeting to the extent
necessary to ensure that (x) a quorum is present and (y) the shares of Class B
Common Stock represented by the Zillow Proxies (as defined in Section 6.02(b)
below) are voted at such Special Meeting in the manner set forth in the Zillow
Proxies. Each of Trulia and Zillow shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its respective stockholders and shareholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement or in favor of the approval of this Agreement,
as the case may be.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Zillow shall
(i) cause the officers of Zillow appointed as attorneys and proxies in each
Irrevocable Proxy delivered by the parties to the Zillow Voting Agreements
(the " _Zillow Proxies_ ") to vote the shares of Zillow Class B Common Stock
at the Zillow Shareholders Meeting to approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Zillow Merger, and to
otherwise vote the shares of such Zillow Class B Common Stock in accordance
with the Zillow Proxies at the Zillow Shareholders Meeting, and (ii) take all
other actions necessary or advisable to effectuate the intent of the Zillow
Proxies, including designating additional officers or directors of Zillow to
act as substitute attorneys and proxies under the Zillow Proxies in the event
that any of the officers listed therein are unwilling or unable to vote the
shares of Zillow Class B Common Stock in accordance with the Zillow Proxies at
the Zillow Shareholders Meeting.

 

(c) Subject to Section 8.01(j), each party hereto agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall not be affected by the public proposal,
public disclosure or communication of any Competing Transaction Proposal, by
the making of any Trulia Board Recommendation Change or Zillow Board
Recommendation Change or the occurrence of an Intervening Event.

 

SECTION 6.03. _Board Recommendations_. (a) Subject to the terms of Section
6.03(b) and Section 6.03(c), (i)(A) the Trulia Board shall cause the Trulia
Board Recommendation to be included in the Joint Proxy Statement and (B)
neither the Trulia Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Zillow, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Zillow, the Trulia
Board Recommendation (a " _Trulia Board Recommendation Change_ ") and (ii) the
Zillow Board shall cause the Zillow Board Recommendation to be included in
the Joint Proxy Statement and (B) neither the Zillow Board nor any committee
thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Trulia, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Trulia, the Zillow Board Recommendation (a " _Zillow Board
Recommendation Change_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), but subject to the provisions of this
Section 6.03(b), (x) the Trulia Board may, at any time prior to receipt of the
Trulia Stockholder Approval, effect a Trulia Board Recommendation Change, and
(y) the Zillow Board may, at any time prior to receipt of the Zillow
Shareholder Approval, effect a Zillow Board Recommendation Change (the party
whose Board is making such Recommendation Change, the " _Subject Party_ "),
if:

 

(i) the Board of the Subject Party has received a bona fide, written Competing
Transaction Proposal that (A) did not result from a breach of Section 6.05
and (B) constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Board of the Subject Party determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering in good faith
any counter-offer or proposal made by the non-Subject Party pursuant to clause
(iv) below), that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the
Board of the Subject Party to make a Trulia Board Recommendation Change or
Zillow Board Recommendation Change, as applicable, would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 

(iii) prior to effecting such Trulia Board Recommendation Change or Zillow
Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, the applicable Board shall
have given the non-Subject Party at least five calendar days notice thereof
(which notice shall include the most current version of such definitive
agreement and, to the extent not included therein, the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the person making
such Superior Proposal) and the opportunity to meet with the

 



41  Subject Party, its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel during
such five day period, all with the purpose and intent of enabling Zillow and
Trulia to discuss in good faith a modification of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Mergers) may be effected; and

 

(iv) the non-Subject Party shall not have made, within five calendar days
after receipt of the written notice required pursuant to clause (iii) above,
a binding irrevocable counter-offer or proposal capable of being accepted by
the Subject Party that the Subject Party Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and
its outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable to its stockholders or
shareholders, as applicable, as such Superior Proposal (it being understood
that any change to the financial terms or any other material term or condition
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice pursuant to clause (iii)
above and a new three calendar day period pursuant to this clause (iv)) (it
being further understood that there may be multiple extensions of such three
calendar day period).

(c) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), but subject to the provisions of this
Section 6.03(c), in response to an Intervening Event (x) the Trulia Board
may, at any time prior to receipt of the Trulia Stockholder Approval, effect a
Trulia Board Recommendation Change, and (y) the Zillow Board may, at any time
prior to receipt of the Zillow Shareholder Approval, effect a Zillow Board
Recommendation Change, if:

(i) the Intervening Event does not involve the receipt of an offer, proposal
or inquiry from any third party relating to a transaction of the nature
described in the definition of "Competing Transaction Proposal" (which, for
purposes of this clause (i), shall be read without reference to
the percentage thresholds set forth in the definition thereof);

(ii) the applicable Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and after considering in good faith any counter-offer or
proposal made by the other party pursuant to clause (iv) below) that, in light
of such Intervening Event, the failure of such Board to make a Trulia Board
Recommendation Change or Zillow Board Recommendation Change, as applicable,
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 

(iii) prior to effecting such Trulia Board Recommendation Change or Zillow
Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, the applicable Board shall
have given the other party at least five business days prior written notice
thereof, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying
such Boards determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and the
rationale and basis for such Trulia Board Recommendation Change or Zillow
Board Recommendation Change, as applicable, and the opportunity to meet with
such Board and its outside legal counsel during such five day period, all
with the purpose and intent of enabling Zillow and Trulia to discuss in good
faith a modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Mergers) may be effected; and

 

(iv) following the expiration of the five business day period after receipt of
the written notice required pursuant to clause (iii) above, the applicable
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
and after giving good faith consideration to any counter-offer or proposal
from the other party that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of
such Board to make a Trulia Board Recommendation Change or Zillow Board
Recommendation Change, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 

(d) Each of (i) the Trulia Board, with respect to any Trulia Board
Recommendation Change, and (ii) the Zillow Board, with respect to any Zillow
Board Recommendation Change, shall ensure that any such recommendation change:
(A) does not change or otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement or any
other approval related thereto by Trulia Board or the Zillow Board,
as applicable; and (B) does not have the effect of causing any Takeover Law
to be applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Mergers or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The parties shall
keep confidential any proposals made by the other party to revise the terms
of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this Agreement
and to the extent required to be disclosed in any SEC Report or as otherwise
required under applicable Law.

 



 



42 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Trulia Board or the Zillow
Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders or shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any statement(s) made by such Board pursuant to
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and provided
further, that any such statements (other than a "stop, look and listen
communication" of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, and within the time period contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)(3)) shall be
deemed to be a Trulia Board Recommendation Change or Zillow Board
Recommendation Change, as applicable, unless the Trulia Board or the Zillow
Board, as applicable, expressly publicly reaffirms the Trulia Board
Recommendation or the Zillow Board Recommendation Change, as applicable, in
connection with such statement.

 

SECTION 6.04. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) Subject to
applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
Trulia and Zillow shall (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to):
(i) provide to the other party (and the other partys officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisor, agents
and other representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") access at
reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its subsidiaries
and to the books and records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly to the other
party such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets,
liabilities, personnel and other aspects of such party and its subsidiaries as
the other party or its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) no party shall be required to afford such access if it
would unreasonably disrupt its operations, (y) a party may withhold any
document or information the disclosure of which would cause a violation of
any agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party (provided that
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure) and (z) a party may
withhold any document or information the disclosure of which would be
reasonably likely to risk a loss of legal privilege (provided that such party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
(or as much of it as possible) in a manner that would not be reasonably likely
to risk a loss of legal privilege)). If any material is withheld pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence or in accordance with applicable Law,
the withholding party shall, to the extent possible without violating an
agreement or applicable Law or risking a loss of legal privilege, inform the
other party as to the general nature of what is being withheld.

 

(b) All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this Section 6.04
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement,
dated July 10, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Zillow and
Trulia.

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

 

SECTION 6.05. _No Solicitation of Transactions_. (a) Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 6.05, from the date hereof until the Effective Time
or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, each party hereto shall not, and shall not authorize or knowingly
permit its Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit
or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate, any Competing
Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Transaction Proposal, or (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any
person (whether or not a person making a Competing Transaction Proposal) with
respect to, any Competing Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal
that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Transaction Proposal.
Each party hereto shall, and shall instruct its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Competing Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably
be expected to lead to a Competing Transaction Proposal, request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished
any such person or its Representatives and immediately terminate all physical
and electronic data room access previously granted to any such person or its
Representatives. Neither the Trulia Board (or any committee thereof) nor the
Zillow Board (or any committee thereof) shall adopt, or propose publicly to
adopt, or allow Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary or

 



43  Zillow or any Zillow Subsidiary, as the case may be, to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other
agreement or arrangement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in this Section 6.05(a)) relating to any Competing Transaction
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
Trulia Stockholder Approval, in the case of the Trulia Board, and Zillow
Shareholder Approval, in the case of the Zillow Board, the Board of Directors
of Zillow or Trulia, as the case may be, may, in response to receipt of a
bona fide written Competing Transaction Proposal that such Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized standing) constitutes or is reasonably
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and which Competing Transaction
Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.05(a), subject to
compliance with Section 6.05(c), (x) furnish (or cause to be
furnished) information with respect to Trulia and its subsidiaries or Zillow
and its subsidiaries, as applicable, to the person making such Competing
Transaction Proposal (and its Representatives) (provided that all such
information has previously been provided to the other party or is provided to
the other party prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not
less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement (other
than with respect to "standstill" provisions), and (y) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Competing Transaction Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the person or persons making
such Competing Transaction Proposal (and such persons or persons
Representatives and financing sources). Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
6.05(a) by a partys Subsidiary or any of such Partys or its Subsidiaries
Representatives shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.05(a) by such
party.

 

(b) As used in this Agreement:

 

A " _Competing Transaction Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer
(whether or not in writing) from a third party (other than Zillow or HoldCo
or any of their respective subsidiaries) with respect to any of the following
(other than the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby): (i)
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary or Zillow or any Zillow Subsidiary,
as the case may be; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other
disposition of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Trulia and the
Trulia Subsidiaries or of Zillow and the Zillow Subsidiaries, as the case may
be; (iii) any issuance, sale or other disposition of 15% or more of the total
outstanding voting power of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary or of Zillow or
any Zillow Subsidiary, as the case may be; (iv) any transaction, including a
tender offer or exchange offer, that, if consummated, would result in any
person (or the stockholders of any person) acquiring, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or
formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of the total outstanding voting power of
Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary or of Zillow or any Zillow Subsidiary, as the
case may be; or (v) any other transaction the consummation of which would
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay
the Mergers.

A " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer from a third party
(other than Zillow or HoldCo or any of their respective subsidiaries) that,
if consummated, would result in such person (or, in the case of a direct
merger, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the voting power of Trulia or Zillow, as the case may be, or
all or substantially all the assets of Trulia and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or Zillow and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be,
and which offer, in the good faith judgment of the applicable Board (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized standing), is more favorable to its stockholders or shareholders,
as applicable, than the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(taking into account all of the terms and conditions of, and the likelihood
of completion of, such offer and of this Agreement (including any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party in response to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise)).

(c) In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.05(a), each party
shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of obtaining knowledge of
the receipt thereof, advise the other party in writing of any

 



44  Competing Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Transaction Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Competing Transaction Proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such
Competing Transaction Proposal. The receiving party shall (i) keep the other
party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis of
the status and details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of
any Competing Transaction Proposal and (ii) provide to the other party as soon
as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof all drafts of
agreements relating to any Competing Transaction Proposal and any written
proposals containing any material terms of a Competing Transaction Proposal or
a counterproposal to a Competing Transaction Proposal, in each case exchanged
between any of the receiving party or any of its subsidiaries or any of the
receiving party or its subsidiaries Representatives, on the one hand, and the
person making any such Competing Transaction Proposal or any of its affiliates
or any of their Representatives, on the other hand.

SECTION 6.06. _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) HoldCo hereby agrees that, for
a period of 12 months immediately following the Effective Time, it shall, or
shall cause the Trulia Surviving Corporation to, (i) provide for each employee
of Trulia and Trulia Subsidiary an annual base salary or annual wage rate that
is no less favorable than the annual base salary or annual base wage rate
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
maintain the employee benefit and compensation plans for the benefit of the
employees of Trulia and Trulia Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, will
provide compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to the employees under the
employee benefit and compensation plans of Trulia and Trulia Subsidiaries as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, HoldCo shall, or shall cause the Trulia
Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms, all
contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of Trulia
and Trulia Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of Trulia
or any Trulia Subsidiary to the extent set forth on Section 6.06(b) of the
Trulia Disclosure Schedule. HoldCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that employees of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary receive credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting (but not for benefit
accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established
or maintained by HoldCo or the Trulia Surviving Corporation in which the
employees of Trulia or Trulia Subsidiaries participate after the Effective
Time for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with
Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting
of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any
such benefit. In addition, HoldCo shall waive, or cause to be waived, any
limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to the same
extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of Zillow or its
subsidiaries and recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-
pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by employees of Trulia and its subsidiaries in the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(c) No provision of this Section 6.06 shall be construed as a limitation on
the right of HoldCo, the Surviving Corporations, Zillow or any Zillow
Subsidiary, or to cause HoldCo, the Surviving Corporations, Zillow or any
Zillow Subsidiary to, amend or terminate any employee benefit plan that
HoldCo, the Surviving Corporations, Zillow or any Zillow Subsidiary would
otherwise have under the terms of the plan, nor shall any provision of this
Section 6.06 be construed to require the continuation of the employment of any
particular employee. The provisions of this Section 6.06 are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor or any other person shall be a
third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.06, and nothing herein shall be
construed as an amendment to any employee benefit plan of HoldCo, the
Surviving Corporations, Zillow or any Zillow Subsidiary or other compensation
or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business
days prior to the Effective Time, Trulia shall have provided to Zillow
calculations prepared by a nationally recognized accounting firm regarding any
"excess parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code that
Trulia, any Trulia 

 



45  Subsidiary, Zillow, any Zillow Subsidiary or HoldCo will be obligated to pay
as a result of the consummation of the Mergers (either alone or in combination
with another event).

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, without the prior approval of the Trulia
Board, HoldCo, Zillow and the Zillow Subsidiaries shall not (i) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Trulia executive officer regarding the
terms or conditions of his or her employment following the Closing, including
any compensation, retention arrangements (including equity incentive grants),
severance or other similar benefits, or (ii) enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (whether written or oral, formal or informal)
with any Trulia executive officer with respect to such matters.

 

SECTION 6.07. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
All rights to indemnification existing as of the date of this Agreement in
favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary for their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Certificates of
Incorporation, By-laws and equivalent organizational documents of Trulia and
the Trulia Subsidiaries (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement), shall
survive the Trulia Merger and shall be honored by the Trulia Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries to the fullest extent available under
applicable Law for a period of six years from the Effective Time, and any
claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to such rights within such six-
year period shall continue to be subject to this Section 6.07(a) and the
indemnification rights provided hereunder until the disposition of such claim.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the Certificates of Incorporation, By-laws
and equivalent organizational documents of the Trulia Surviving Corporation
and the Trulia Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable in the
aggregate with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the
Certificates of Incorporation, By-laws and equivalent organizational documents
of Trulia and the Trulia Subsidiaries (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement), which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents of Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be
required by Law. The Trulia Surviving Corporation shall (and HoldCo shall
cause the Trulia Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of Trulia and the Trulia Subsidiaries pursuant to the
indemnification agreements between Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary and any
current or former directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of
Trulia or any Trulia Subsidiary (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement).

 

(b) The Trulia Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time, if available, the
current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by
Trulia (provided that the Trulia Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that
are no less favorable in the aggregate) with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Trulia Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to
this Section 6.07(b) more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current
annual premiums paid by Trulia for such insurance. In lieu of the foregoing,
prior to the Effective Time, Trulia may in its discretion purchase, and Zillow
or HoldCo may in its discretion purchase if Trulia declines to do so, a
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the six-
year period from and after the Effective Time from a carrier with comparable
or better credit ratings to Trulias current directors and officers
insurance policy carrier(s) and on terms and conditions not less favorable in
the aggregate to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Trulia with respect to
matters occurring up to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
without Zillows consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), the cost of such "tail" policy shall not exceed an amount equal
to 250% of current annual premiums paid by Trulia for such insurance. If a
"tail" policy is obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Trulia Surviving
Corporation shall (and HoldCo shall cause the Trulia Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such policy in full force and effect for its full term and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(c) In the event the Trulia Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such

 



46  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Trulia
Surviving Corporation or, at HoldCos option, HoldCo shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.07.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.07 shall (i) survive consummation of the
Mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise.

SECTION 6.08. _Insurance Policies_. Trulia shall take all commercially
reasonable actions to ensure that all of its current and legacy insurance
policies are available for the benefit of the Trulia Surviving Corporation,
including with respect any instances where an occurrence and/or claim takes
place before the Effective Time and is not made known until after the
Effective Time.

thereof have been satisfied); or

 

(iv) if Trulia terminates the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(j);

 

then Trulia shall pay to Zillow promptly (but in any event no later than one

SECTION 9.04. _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to an Exhibit, an Article or a Section, such reference
shall be to an Exhibit, an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "as of the date hereof", when used in this Agreement,
means as of the date of this Agreement. Documents, materials and information
are deemed to have been "made available" to Zillow or Trulia, as applicable,
if such documents, materials or information were available for review by such
person and its representatives through the electronic data rooms entitled
"Project Tiger" or "Tiger," as applicable, each of which are hosted by R.R.
Donnelley and Sons (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/venue) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or disclosed in a Trulia SEC Report or Zillow
SEC Report, as applicable, filed and publicly available. The term "or" is not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if". The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement,
instrument or Law defined or referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a person are also to
its successors and permitted assigns. When calculating the period of time
before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step
taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded, and if the last day of such period
is not a business day, the period shall end on the immediately following
business day. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to
"dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United
States of America. Each of the parties has participated in the 

 



63  drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

SECTION 9.06. _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement, taken
together with Trulia Disclosure Schedule, the Zillow Disclosure Schedule, the
Voting Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and (b) shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each party hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies, other than Sections 6.07 (which is intended to be for the
benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons).

 

SECTION 9.07. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ that Zillow
and HoldCo may assign their rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement
to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Zillow so long as Zillow
continues to remain liable for all of such obligations as if no such
assignment had occurred. Any purported assignment without such consent shall
be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 9.08. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that,
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party
hereto hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond
in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereto further agree
not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that
Trulia shall be entitled to seek all available remedies (both in equity and in
law) with respect to any breach of Section 6.02 by Zillow notwithstanding
that the Shareholder Fee has been paid or may be payable by Zillow with
respect to such breach (it being understood and agreed that the Shareholder
Fee shall not be deemed liquidated damages with respect to any such breach).
In the event that a party initiates a proceeding seeking equitable relief
pursuant to this Section 9.08, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended until such proceeding is finally resolved.

 

SECTION 9.09. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Court. The parties hereto
hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware

 



64  Chancery Court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and
agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such
Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the
above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named
courts.

 

SECTION 9.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.10.

 

SECTION 9.11. _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Report References_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of
either Trulia Disclosure Schedule or the Zillow Disclosure Schedule shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) (x) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding
Section of this Agreement and (y) any other representations and warranties of
such party that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of
that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to a person who
has read that reference and such representations and warranties, without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed. The mere inclusion of an item in either Trulia Disclosure Schedule
or the Zillow Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty (i) shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material event, circumstance, change,
effect, developments or condition or that such item would constitute a
Material Adverse Effect and (ii) shall not be construed as an admission by the
disclosing party of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party
rights (including any intellectual property rights) or any law, regulation,
order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority, such disclosures
having been made solely for the purposes of creating exceptions to the
representations made herein or of disclosing any information required to be
disclosed under this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of
any Trulia SEC Report or Zillow SEC Report shall only be deemed to be an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) the relevant partys
representations and warranties if the relevance of that information as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be reasonably apparent to a person who has read that
information concurrently with such representations and warranties, without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed.

SECTION 9.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, such as by
electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

Stock_" (collectively the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
are referred to herein as the " _Common Stock_ "), " _Class C Capital Stock_
," and " _Preferred Stock_." The total number of shares of Class A Common
Stock that this corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,245,000,000,

_2.2 Preferred Stock _

This corporations board of directors (the " _Board of Directors_ ") shall
have the full authority permitted by law to divide the authorized and
unissued shares of Preferred Stock into series, and to provide for the
issuance of such shares (in an aggregate amount not exceeding the aggregate
number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized by this corporations articles
of incorporation (as amended or restated from time to time) (the or these "
_Articles_ ")), as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors and
stated, before the issuance of any shares thereof, in the resolution or
resolutions providing for the issuance thereof. The Board of Directors shall
have the authority to fix and determine and to amend the number of shares of
any series of Preferred Stock that is wholly unissued or to be established and
to fix and determine and to amend the designation, preferences, voting powers
and limitations, and the relative, participating, optional or other rights, of
any series of shares of Preferred Stock that is wholly unissued or to be
established, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
voting rights relating to shares of such series of Preferred Stock, the rate
of dividend to which holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock may
be entitled, the rights of holders of shares of such series of Preferred
Stock in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of
this corporation, the rights of holders of shares of such series of Preferred
Stock to convert or exchange shares of such series of Preferred Stock for
shares of any other capital stock or for any other securities, property or
assets of this corporation, and whether or not the shares of such series of
Preferred Stock shall be redeemable and, if so, the term and conditions of
such redemption.

Before this corporation shall initially issue shares of a series of Preferred
Stock created under RCW 23B.06.020 (or any successor provision thereto) of
the Washington Business Corporation Act, articles of amendment setting forth
the terms of such series in a form meeting the requirements of RCW 23B.06.020
shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington in the
manner prescribed by the Washington Business Corporation Act, and shall be
effective without shareholder approval. Unless otherwise specifically provided
in the resolution establishing any series of Preferred Stock, the Board
of Directors shall further have the authority, after the issuance of shares
of a series whose number it has designated, to amend the resolution
establishing such series to decrease the number of shares of that series, but
not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, prior to the
Threshold Date, this corporation shall not, without the approval of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common
Stock, considered as a separate voting group, or the written agreement of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common
Stock: (i) initially issue any series of Preferred Stock, or any other
security convertible into or exercisable for any such series of Preferred
Stock, including by merger or otherwise, or (ii) amend the
designation, preferences, voting powers and limitations, or rights, of any
series of Preferred Stock, or any other security convertible into or
exercisable for any such series of Preferred Stock, unless, in the case of
either clause (i) or (ii) above, such action is approved by the Board of
Directors including at least one of the Founders (as defined in Section 2.3(g)
of these Articles) acting in his capacity as a director of this corporation.

 

 _2.3 Common Stock_

The preferences, limitations, voting powers and relative rights of the Class
A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock (subject to the preferences and
rights of the Preferred Stock as determined by the Board of Directors pursuant
to Section 2.2 of these Articles) are as follows:

(a) _Voting Rights_.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in these Articles, or except as required by
applicable law (subject to Article 11 of these Articles), the holders of Class
A Common Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock shall vote together as
a single voting group on all matters submitted to a vote of this
corporations shareholders.

(ii) Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Articles or required
pursuant to RCW 23B.07.210(2), each holder of Class A Common Stock shall be
entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Class A Common Stock held as of the
applicable record date on any matter that is submitted to a vote of the
shareholders of this corporation (including, without limitation, any matter
voted on at a shareholders meeting), and

 

(iii) Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Articles or required
pursuant to RCW 23B.07.210(2), each holder of Class B Common Stock shall be
entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Class B Common Stock held as of
the applicable record date on any matter that is submitted to a vote of the
shareholders of the corporation (including, without limitation, any matter
voted on at a shareholders meeting).

(b) _Dividends and Distributions_. Subject to the preferences applicable to
any series of Preferred Stock, if any, outstanding at any time, shares of
Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be treated equally,
identically and ratably, on a per share basis, with respect to any
Distribution as may be declared by the Board of Directors from time to time
with respect to the Common Stock, unless different treatment of the shares of
each such class is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and the holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting
separately as a separate voting group; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event any such Distribution declared by the Board of Directors with
respect to the Common Stock is paid in the form of Class A Common Stock or
Class B Common Stock (or Rights to acquire such class of stock), then holders
of Class A Common Stock shall receive Class A Common Stock (or Rights to
acquire such stock, as the case may be) and holders of Class B Common Stock
shall receive Class B Common Stock (or Rights to acquire such stock, as the
case may be). Subject to the preferences applicable to any series of Preferred
Stock, the shares of Class A Common Stock and the shares of Class B Common
Stock are entitled to the net assets of this corporation upon dissolution in
accordance with Chapter 23B.14 of the RCW.

 

(c) _Subdivision or Combination_. If this corporation in any manner subdivides
or combines the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common
Stock, the outstanding shares of the other such class will be subdivided or
combined in the same proportion and manner, unless different treatment of the
shares of each such class is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each
voting separately as a separate voting group.

 



-2- (d) _Equal Status_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Articles
or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common Stock and shares of
Class B Common Stock shall have the same rights and privileges and rank
equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, in connection with
a Change of Control Transaction, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common Stock shall be treated equally, identically and ratably, on a per share
basis, with respect to any consideration into which such shares are converted
or any consideration paid or otherwise distributed in respect of such shares
to shareholders of this corporation, unless different treatment of the shares
of each such class is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and the holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting
separately as a separate voting group.

 

(e) _Conversion of Class B Common Stock_.

 

(i) _Voluntary Conversion_. Each share of the Class B Common Stock shall be
convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common
Stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon either (A) written
notice to the Secretary and compliance with the procedures for voluntary
conversion as set forth in Section 2.3(e)(v) of Article 2, or (B) if the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock and
the corporation have entered into a written agreement to amend the procedures,
or adopt other procedures, governing the voluntary conversion of the Class B
Common Stock, upon compliance with such procedures as amended or adopted in
such written agreement.

(ii)  _Automatic Conversion_. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall
automatically, without any further action, convert into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon a Transfer of such share,
other than a Transfer: 

(A) from a Founder, or any Permitted Entity of such Founder, to the other
Founder, or any Permitted Entity of such other Founder.

(B) by a Founder to any of the entities, accounts, plans or trusts listed in
clauses (1) through (6) below (each, a " _Permitted Entity_ " and,
collectively, " _Permitted Entities_ "), and from any such Permitted Entity
back to such Founder and/or any other Permitted Entity established by or for
such Founder:

(1) a trust for the benefit of such Founder or persons other than such Founder
so long as such Founder has sole dispositive power and exclusive Voting
Control with respect to the shares of Class B Common Stock held by such trust;
_provided_ such Transfer does not involve any payment of cash, securities,
property or other consideration (other than an interest in such trust) to
such Founder, and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event such Founder no
longer has sole dispositive power and exclusive Voting Control with respect to
the shares of Class B Common Stock held by such trust, each share of Class B
Common Stock then held by such trust shall automatically convert into one (1)
fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock;

 

(2) a trust under the terms of which such Founder has retained a "qualified
interest" within the meaning of Section 2702(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue
Code and/or a reversionary interest so long as such Founder has sole
dispositive power and exclusive Voting Control with respect to the shares of
Class B Common Stock held by such trust;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event such Founder no longer has sole dispositive power and exclusive
Voting Control with respect to the shares of Class B Common Stock held by such
trust, each share of Class B Common Stock then held by such trust shall
automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class
A Common Stock;

 

(3) an Individual Retirement Account, as defined in Section 408(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, or a pension, profit sharing, stock bonus or other
type of plan or trust of which such Founder is a participant or beneficiary
and which satisfies the requirements for qualification under Section 401 of
the Internal Revenue Code; _provided_ that in each case such Founder has sole

 



-3-  dispositive power and exclusive Voting Control with respect to the shares of
Class B Common Stock held in such account, plan or trust, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the event such Founder no longer has sole dispositive
power and exclusive Voting Control with respect to the shares of Class B
Common Stock held by such account, plan or trust, each of such Founders
shares of Class B Common Stock then held by such account, plan or trust shall
automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class
A Common Stock;

 

(4) a corporation in which such Founder directly, or indirectly through one or
more Permitted Entities, owns shares with sufficient Voting Control in the
corporation, or otherwise has legally enforceable rights, such that such
Founder retains sole dispositive power and exclusive Voting Control with
respect to the shares of Class B Common Stock held by such corporation;
_provided_ that in the event such Founder no longer owns sufficient shares or
no longer has sufficient legally enforceable rights to enable such Founder to
retain sole dispositive power and exclusive Voting Control with respect
to the shares of Class B Common Stock held by such corporation, each share of
Class B Common Stock then held by such corporation shall automatically convert
into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock;

 

(5) a partnership in which such Founder directly, or indirectly through one or
more Permitted Entities, owns partnership interests with sufficient Voting
Control in the partnership, or otherwise has legally enforceable rights, such
that such Founder retains sole dispositive power and exclusive Voting Control
with respect to the shares of Class B Common Stock held by such partnership;
_provided_ that in the event such Founder no longer owns sufficient
partnership interests or no longer has sufficient legally enforceable rights
to enable such Founder to retain sole dispositive power and exclusive
Voting Control with respect to the shares of Class B Common Stock held by
such partnership, each share of Class B Common Stock then held by such
partnership shall automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock; or

(6) a limited liability company in which such Founder directly, or indirectly
through one or more Permitted Entities, owns membership interests with

power and exclusive Voting Control with respect to the shares of Class B
Common Stock held by such limited liability company; _provided_ that in the
event such Founder no longer owns sufficient membership interests or no longer
has sufficient legally enforceable rights to enable such Founder to retain
sole dispositive power and exclusive Voting Control with respect to the shares
of Class B Common Stock held by such limited liability company, each share of
Class B Common Stock then held by such limited liability company
shall automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share
of Class A Common Stock.

(iii)  _Conversion Upon Death or Mental Disability_. Each share of Class B
Common Stock held of record by a Founder, or by any of such Founders
Permitted Entities, shall automatically, without any further action, convert
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon the
death or Mental Disability of such Founder; provided, however, that:

 

(A) If a Founder or such Founders Permitted Entity (in either case, the "
_Transferring Founder_ ") transfers exclusive Voting Control (but not
ownership) of shares of Class B Common Stock to the other Founder (the "
_Transferee Founder_ ") which transfer of Voting Control is contingent or
effective upon the death or Mental Disability of the Transferring Founder,
then each share of Class B Common Stock that is the subject of such transfer
shall automatically convert into one fully paid and nonassessable share of
Class A Common Stock upon that date which is the earlier of: (a) nine months
after the earlier of the date upon which the Transferring Founder died or the
date upon which Mental Disability in respect of such Transferring Founder
occurred, as the case be, or (b) the date upon which the Transferee Founder
ceases to hold exclusive Voting Control over such shares of Class B Common
Stock; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Transferee Founder shall die or
suffer Mental Disability within nine 

 



-4-  months following the death or Mental Disability, as the case may be, of the
Transferring Founder, then a trustee designated by the Transferee Founder and
approved by the Board of Directors may exercise Voting Control over: (x) such
shares of Class B Common Stock of the Transferring Founder or the Transferring
Founders Permitted Entity and, in such instance, each such share of Class B
Common Stock shall automatically convert into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon that date which is the
earlier of (1) nine months after the earlier of the date upon which the
Transferring Founder died or the date upon which Mental Disability in respect
of such Transferring Founder occurred, as the case be, or (2) the date upon
which such trustee ceases to hold exclusive Voting Control over such shares of
Class B Common Stock; and (y) the Transferee Founders shares of Class B
Common Stock (or shares of Class B Common Stock held of record by any
Permitted Entity of the Transferee Founder) and, in such instance, each such
share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into one fully paid
and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon that date which is the
earlier of: (1) nine months after the earlier of the date upon which the
Transferee Founder died or the date upon which Mental Disability in respect of
such Transferee Founder occurred, as the case be, or (2) the date upon which
such trustee ceases to hold exclusive Voting Control over such shares of Class
B Common Stock; and

 

(B) If one Founder dies or Mental Disability in respect of such Founder occurs
simultaneously with when the other Founder dies or Mental Disability in
respect of such other Founder occurs (such simultaneous occurrence, a "
_Simultaneous Event_ "), a trustee designated by the Founders and approved by
the Board of Directors may exercise Voting Control over the Founders shares
of Class B Common Stock (or shares of Class B Common Stock held of record by
any of the Permitted Entities of either of the Founders) and, in such
instance, each such share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon that
date which is the earlier of (a) nine months after the date of the
Simultaneous Event or (b) the date upon which such trustee ceases to
hold exclusive Voting Control over such shares of Class B Common Stock.

(iv) _Procedures_. This corporation may, from time to time, establish such
policies and procedures relating to the administration of the dual class
structure, including, without limitation, the issuance of stock certificates
or procedures with respect to book entry systems, as it deems necessary
or advisable. This corporation may request that holders of shares of Class B
Common Stock furnish affidavits, certificates or other proof to this
corporation as it deems necessary to verify the ownership of Class B Common
Stock and to confirm that a conversion to Class A Common Stock has not
occurred. A determination by the Secretary of this corporation (the "
_Secretary_ ") with respect to whether a Transfer results in a conversion to
Class A Common Stock shall be conclusive and binding.

(v) _Mechanics of Conversion_. Before any holder of Class B Common Stock shall
be entitled to convert voluntarily some or all shares of such holders Class
B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.3(e)(i) of this Article 2, such holder shall give signed written notice (the
" _Conversion Notice_ ") to the Secretary at the office of this corporation
that such holder elects to convert the same, shall state therein the number of
shares to be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock, and shall
surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of Class B
Common Stock of which all or a portion are to be converted, at the office of
this corporation (and accompanied by all transfer taxes (or proof of payment
thereof), if any);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the certificate or
certificates evidencing the shares to be converted have been lost, stolen, or
destroyed, the holder may, in lieu of delivering such certificate or
certificates, notify the Secretary that such certificate or certificates have
been lost, stolen, or destroyed and execute and deliver an agreement
satisfactory to this corporation (the " _lost certificate agreement_ ") to
indemnify this corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with
such certificate or certificates. If requested by such holder, this
corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, provide for the issuance

Stock.
