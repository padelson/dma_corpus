transactions contemplated hereby and (b)&nbsp;shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or

assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; <U>provided</U> that Zillow and HoldCo may assign their rights and obligations pursuant to
this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Zillow so long as Zillow continues to remain liable for all of such obligations as if no such assignment had occurred. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.

of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement,
without proof of actual damages (and each party hereto hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties hereto further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any
such breach. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that Trulia shall be entitled to seek all available remedies (both in equity and in law) with respect to any breach of Section&nbsp;6.02 by Zillow notwithstanding that
the Shareholder Fee has been paid or may be payable by Zillow with respect to such breach (it being understood and agreed that the Shareholder Fee shall not be deemed liquidated damages with respect to any such breach). In the event that a party
initiates a proceeding seeking equitable relief pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9.08, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended until such proceeding is finally resolved. </P>
