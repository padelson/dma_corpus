 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.5 Surrender and Payment.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint U.S. Bank
National Association (the "Paying Agent") to act as paying agent in connection
with the consideration to be paid to the Company Equityholders pursuant to a
paying agent agreement among Parent, Representative and Paying Agent in

Warrants (collectively, "Exchange Documentation") in exchange for the payment
of such portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (including Option
Consideration and Warrant Consideration) to which the Company Equityholders
are entitled pursuant to Section 1.4. Each Company Equityholder, upon proper
surrender of Exchange Documentation to the Paying Agent in accordance with the
instructions in such notice, shall be entitled to receive, in exchange
therefor, the payments required by Section 1.4. Until properly surrendered,
each such Exchange Documentation shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence
only the right to receive the payments required by Section 1.4. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t5  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

shall be allocated among the Company Equityholders, in addition to an

rely on, and shall have no liability to any party to this Agreement or to any
Company Equityholder for any payment reflected on, the Distribution Schedule.
The Distribution Schedule shall include: \t\t

number of each Company Equityholder; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)the Aggregate Liquidation Preference Amount;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)each Company Equityholder's Fully Diluted Ownership

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv)the Preferred Per Share Merger Consideration for each series of

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v)the allocation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration among the
Company Equityholders, determined in accordance with the Company Charter as in
effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the allocation
of any cash consideration and any Parent Shares issuable to each Company
Equityholder and the allocation of the Closing Consideration payable to each
Company Equityholder; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi)the number of shares (separated by class and series) of Company
Stock; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vii)certificate number(s) for Company Stock. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)At the Closing, Parent shall deliver or pay, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to deliver or pay, in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the balance of amounts of the Indebtedness identified on the
"Indebtedness Pay-Off Schedule" and outstanding Equityholder Transaction
Expenses identified on the "Equityholder Transaction Expenses Schedule", each
delivered to Parent by Company at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)all amounts necessary to fully discharge the then-outstanding
balances of the Indebtedness identified on the Indebtedness Pay-Off Schedule
shall be paid on behalf of Company to the applicable creditors' accounts set
forth in the Pay-Off Letters or as otherwise advised by such creditors in
writing; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)all amounts necessary to fully discharge the then-outstanding
balances of Equityholder Transaction Expenses identified on the Equityholder
Transaction Expenses Schedule shall be paid on behalf of Company to the
accounts designated by the Persons owed such amounts as set forth on the

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t6  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

(f)Parent shall pay (i) the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration
payable to Accredited Equityholders with respect to their Company Stock and
Warrants in a number of Parent Shares (rounded up to the nearest share) equal
to such portion of the Closing Merger Consideration divided by the Parent
Trading Price at Signing, as adjusted by reference to and determined in
accordance with the Company Charter (the "Parent Share Consideration"), (ii)
the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable to non-Accredited
Equityholders with respect to their Company Stock in cash (the "Closing Cash
Consideration"), and (iii) the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration
consisting of Option Consideration to the Optionholders in cash. The
allocation of the Parent Share Consideration, Closing Cash Consideration and
Option Consideration shall be set forth in the Distribution Schedule. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)At the Closing, (A) Parent shall deposit the Closing Cash
Consideration with the Paying Agent, and (B) through such mechanics as may be
required taking into account the requirements of applicable Law and accounting
and tax considerations, Parent shall, or shall cause a third party to, deposit
with the Paying Agent in electronic or book-entry form, for the benefit of the
Accredited Equityholders, evidence of the Parent Share Consideration
determined, in each case, based upon the Estimated Net Working Capital.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
deliver to each Accredited Equityholder and who has completed and returned the
requisite Exchange Documentation to the Paying Agent, together with Company
Stock Certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Stock or
original copies of Warrants (or an affidavit of lost instrument in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent but without any bond), the Parent Share
Consideration payable to such Accredited Equityholder, and in any event within
three (3) Business Days after return of such documentation to the Paying
Agent; provided, however, that Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver
the Parent Share Consideration on the Closing Date to each Accredited
Equityholder who at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing has
completed and returned the requisite Exchange Documentation to the Paying
Agent, together with Company Stock Certificates representing outstanding
shares of Company Stock or original copies of Warrants (or an affidavit of
lost instrument in form reasonably acceptable to Parent but without any bond).
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to each Stockholder
who is a non-Accredited Equityholder and who has completed and returned the
requisite Exchange Documentation to the Paying Agent, together with any
applicable Company Stock Certificate (or affidavit of lost stock certificate
in form reasonably acceptable to Parent but without any bond), promptly after
receipt of such returned Exchange Documentation, but in any event within three
(3) Business Days thereafter, a check (or if elected by such Stockholder, a
wire transfer) representing that portion of the Closing Cash Consideration to
which such Stockholder is entitled. The delivery of such checks (or wire
transfers, as applicable) by the Paying Agent shall be deemed, for all
purposes, to have satisfied in full the obligations of Parent to pay the
Closing Cash Consideration to such Stockholders and neither Parent nor the
Paying Agent shall have any further obligation for such payments. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

(iii)On or before the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Company's payroll provider, in trust for the benefit of
Optionholders with respect to their Options, the aggregate amount of Option

the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall cause the payroll
provider to pay to each Optionholder who has completed and returned the
requisite Exchange Documentation to the Paying Agent, together with original
copies of his, her or its Options (or an affidavit of lost instrument in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent but without any bond), the Option
Consideration payable to such Optionholder, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days after return of such documentation to the Paying Agent;
provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the payroll provider to deliver the
Option Consideration on the Closing Date to each Optionholder who at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing has completed and returned the
requisite Exchange Documentation to the Paying Agent, together with original
copies of his, her or its Options (or an affidavit of lost instrument in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent but without any bond). Parent will direct the
Company's payroll provider to withhold from the cash payments made with
respect to Options held by Optionholders immediately prior to the Effective
Time, in lieu of paying the withheld amounts to those holders of Options, all
withholding Taxes, if any, related to the amount received by such holder of
Options, such amounts to be disbursed as set forth in Section 1.11
below. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv)Parent shall not be required to pay any amount of the Closing Cash
Consideration, the Parent Share Consideration, the Option Consideration, or
any portion of any Earnout Payment to any Company Equityholder until receipt
by the Paying Agent from such Company Equityholder of properly completed and
executed Letters of Transmittal and the applicable Company Stock Certificate
or original copies of Options or Warrants (or an affidavit of lost instrument
in form reasonably acceptable to Parent but without any bond (except as may be
required by the Paying Agent)). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)The Parent Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be
issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act by
reason of Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act and may not be re-offered or resold other than in conformity
with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other
applicable rules and regulations or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. Until
the resale by the Accredited Equityholders of their Parent Shares has become
registered (including pursuant to the Registration Statement) under the
Securities Act, or otherwise transferable pursuant to an exemption from such
registration otherwise required thereunder, the Parent Shares issued to the
Accredited Equityholders shall be characterized as "restricted securities"
under the Securities Act and, if certificated, shall bear the following legend
(or if held in book entry form, will be noted with a similar
restriction): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN
ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY, AND THE RESALE OF SUCH SHARES HAS NOT
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t8  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE RESOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION WITHOUT AN EXEMPTION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tParent agrees to cooperate in a timely manner with the Company
Equityholders holding Registrable Securities to remove any restrictive legends
or similar transfer instructions from the Registrable Securities upon the
registration of the Registrable Securities or in the event that the
Registrable Securities are otherwise transferable pursuant to an exemption
from registration otherwise required thereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h)At the Closing, Parent shall deposit or shall cause the Surviving
Company to deposit with U.S. Bank National Association (the "Escrow Agent")
the Escrow Amount into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") pursuant to
the terms of an Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
"Escrow Agreement"). "Escrow Amount" means a number of Parent Shares equal to
$7,500,000 divided by the Parent Trading Price at Signing (the "Escrow
Shares," together with all distributions, dividends and payments thereon, the
"Escrow Fund"). After all adjustments and deductions, the remainder of the
Escrow Fund shall be allocated pro rata to each Preferred Stockholder and
Warrant Holder according to such Preferred Stockholder's or Warrant Holder's
Proportionate Share as set forth in the Distribution Schedule and Section 7.9
below. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject
to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes
of and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by
the Company Equityholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement
and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the indemnification
obligations, placement of the Escrow Amount in escrow and the appointment of
the Representative and establishment of the Representative Reserve. For all
United States federal and state and local Tax purposes, the Preferred
Stockholders and Warrant Holders shall be treated as the owners of the Escrow
Shares (including any distributions, dividends and payments thereon) prior to
release of the Escrow Shares (and other amounts) from the Escrow Account and
the Representative shall act as an agent for the benefit of the Preferred
Stockholders and Warrant Holders with respect to such Escrow Shares (and other
amounts) in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)At the Closing, Parent shall deposit or shall cause the Surviving
Company to deposit with the Representative an amount equal to $500,000 (the
"Representative Reserve"), which amount shall be used to fund potential
expenses of the Representative in carrying out its authorized duties in
accordance with Section 8.1 hereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j)At such times and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
Annex 1 hereto, as additional consideration for the Merger, and subject to the
setoff rights of Parent Indemnitees pursuant to Article 7 hereof, after the
Effective Time, Parent shall make the Earnout Payments to the Company
Equityholders in accordance with each Company Equityholders' Fully Diluted
Ownership Percentage. Any such Earnout Payments, including, without
limitation, the Accelerated Payment, shall be payable in cash and Parent
Shares, with the allocation between cash and Parent Shares at the discretion
of Parent; provided, however, that (1) at least the Minimum Share
Consideration shall be paid in Parent Shares, and (2) all amounts payable to
Optionholders with respect to their Options shall be paid in cash.  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t9  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

(k)Until surrendered in accordance with this Agreement, each Company Stock
Certificate, Option or Warrant shall represent after the Effective Time for
all purposes only the right to receive payment as provided in this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l)At any time following the day that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any earnings received with respect thereto)
and Parent Shares that had been made available to the Paying Agent with
respect to the Closing Merger Consideration and that have not been disbursed
to Company Equityholders and thereafter such Company Equityholders shall be
entitled to look only to the Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) and only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable portion of Closing Merger Consideration payable to them, without
interest thereon. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.6 Purchase Price Adjustment.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)As promptly as possible, but in any event within sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Representative its
calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing
Date Net Working Capital" and such statement, the "Net Working Capital
Statement"). The Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be calculated in
accordance with the accounting principles and components set forth on Exhibit
D. The Net Working Capital Statement shall entirely disregard any of the
plans, transactions, or changes which Parent intends to initiate or make or
cause to be initiated or made after the Closing with respect to the Surviving
Company and its business and assets, and any facts or circumstances that are
unique or particular to Parent or any of its assets or liabilities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) provide
the Representative and its Agents with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities and employees of
the Surviving Company to the extent reasonably necessary for their review of
the Net Working Capital Statement, and (ii) cooperate with the Representative
and its Agents in connection with such review, including providing on a timely
basis all other information reasonably requested by the Representative and its
Agents that is to be used in connection with the review of the Net Working
Capital Statement. If the Representative has any objections to the Net
Working Capital Statement, the Representative shall deliver to Parent a
statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "Objections Statement"),
which statement shall identify in reasonable detail those items and amounts to
which the Representative objects (the "Disputed Items") and shall include the
Representative's calculation of the amounts in dispute. If an Objections
Statement is not delivered to Parent within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Net Working Capital Statement, the Net Working Capital Statement as
prepared by Parent shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties.
The Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
Disputed Items and all such discussions shall (unless otherwise agreed by
Parent and the Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, but if they do not reach a
final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement to Parent, the Representative and Parent shall submit any unresolved
Disputed Items (and only such unresolved Disputed Items) to an independent
national accounting firm mutually selected by Parent and the Representative
(the "Accounting Firm"). In the event the parties submit any unresolved
Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm, each party shall submit  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t10  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

a Net Working Capital Statement (which in the case of each party may be a Net
Working Capital Statement that, with respect to the unresolved Disputed Items
(but not, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other items), is
different than the Net Working Capital Statement initially submitted to the
Representative, or the Objections Statement delivered to Parent, as
applicable) together with such supporting documentation as it deems
appropriate, to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days after the date on
which such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution. The Representative and Parent shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve such
dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after
the date on which the Accounting Firm receives the Net Working Capital
Statements prepared by the Representative and Parent. In resolving any such
dispute, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any unresolved Disputed
Item greater than the highest amount the Representative or Parent assigns to
such Disputed Item in their respective Net Working Capital Statements or less
than the lowest amount the Representative or Parent assigns to such Disputed
Item in their respective Net Working Capital Statements. The Representative
and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Accounting Firm to notify them in writing of its resolution of such
dispute as soon as practicable. The Net Working Capital Statement that
includes the final determination of the unresolved Disputed Items by the
Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties.
Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the
resolution of such dispute by the Accounting Firm. All costs and expenses of
the Accounting Firm, if any, shall be paid by Parent and the Representative
(on behalf of the Company Equityholders), respectively, in the proportion that
the aggregate dollar amount of the spread between the unresolved Disputed
Items submitted to the Accounting Firm by such party that are unsuccessfully
disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to
the aggregate dollar amount of the spread between all unresolved Disputed
Items submitted by Parent and Representative. For example, should the spread
between the items in dispute total $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600
in favor of the Representative's position, 60% of the costs of the Accounting
Firm's review would be borne by Parent and 40% of the costs would be borne by
Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)If the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant
to Section 1.6(b) (the "Final Net Working Capital") is greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital by more than $200,000, then, within five (5)
Business Days after the determination of the Final Net Working Capital, Parent
will pay or will cause the Surviving Company to pay to each Company
Equityholder such Company Equityholder's Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage of
the amount in excess of $200,000, less the amount, if any, paid to Company
Equityholders at Closing if Estimated Net Working Capital exceeded the Net
Working Capital Target by more than $200,000, plus the amount, if any,
deducted from payments to Company Equityholders at Closing if Estimated Net
Working Capital was less than the Net Working Capital Target by more than
$200,000. Any such amount shall be payable in cash and Parent Shares, with
the allocation between cash and Parent Shares at the discretion of Parent;
provided, however, that (1) at least the Minimum Share Consideration shall be
paid in Parent Shares, and (2) all amounts payable to any non-Accredited
Equityholders and to any Optionholders with respect to their Company Shares or
Options, respectively, shall be paid in cash.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital by more than $200,000, then, within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Net  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t11  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Working Capital, Parent and Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to Parent the amount in excess of $200,000 plus the amount, if
any, paid to Company Equityholders at Closing if Estimated Net Working Capital
exceeded the Net Working Capital Target by more than $200,000, less the
amount, if any, deducted from payments to Company Equityholders at Closing if
Estimated Net Working Capital was less than the Net Working Capital Target by
more than $200,000. Any such amounts shall be paid from the Escrow Account.
Any such payment to Parent shall consist of Parent Shares (valued at the
Parent Trading Price at Signing). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)All payments required pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and Section 1.6(d)
shall be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate purchase
price paid by Parent pursuant to this Agreement (in the case of Parent, in
respect of the shares in the Surviving Company held by Parent as a result of
the Merger), unless otherwise required by applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.7 Registration Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Parent shall file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3
(including any amendments or supplements, the "Registration Statement") and
the prospectus (including any amendments or supplements, the "Prospectus")
forming part of the Registration Statement in compliance with Rule 415 under
the Securities Act covering the resale on a continuous basis of all of the
Registrable Securities (as defined below) held by all holders that have
adequately and timely provided Parent with all selling shareholder information
required under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be included in the Registration Statement as soon as reasonably
practicable after the later of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the date of
completion by the Company's auditor of its review of the Company's financial
statements for the six (6) month period ended on June 30, 2015 and Parent's
receipt of the consents of Company's auditor required pursuant to Section 5.5
hereof (but in no event later than fifteen (15) days following such date).
After the Closing Parent and the Company shall mutually cooperate in good
faith with respect to the completion of the financial statements referenced in
the immediately preceding sentence. The Parent Shares issued as Parent Share
Consideration in connection with the Closing as well as any Parent Shares that
may be issued in connection with any adjustment pursuant to Section 1.6(c),
any indemnification claims pursuant to Article 7 and any Earnout Payments are
referred to herein as the "Registrable Securities." In connection with the
filing of the Registration Statement, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective as
soon as reasonably practicable and to remain effective as provided herein.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be required
to file a Registration Statement at any time during which the Company
financial statements required by Article 3 of Regulation S-X have not been
completed and made available to Parent. The number of Registrable Securities
shall be determined at the time of Closing, including the maximum number of
Parent Shares that may be issued hereunder. Such maximum number of
Registrable Securities shall be reserved for the benefit of the Holders of
Registrable Securities and covered by the Registration Statement for the
benefit of the Holders of Registrable Securities for the time periods set
forth in this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and
file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the Registration
Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective
until the earliest of (i) such time that all Registrable Securities covered by
the Registration Statement have been sold thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t12  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act ("Rule 144"), and (ii) such
time that all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
may be sold without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144
and without the requirement for Parent to be in compliance with the current
public information requirement under Rule 144 (the "Effectiveness
Period"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Parent shall furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities such
number of copies, without charge, of such Registration Statement, each
amendment and supplement thereto, and Prospectus included therein, all
exhibits and other documents filed therewith and such other documents as such
Holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request in order to facilitate
the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder of
Registrable Securities. Parent will (i) keep the Representative advised in
writing as to the initiation of the registration and as to the effectiveness
thereof, and (ii) give the Representative the reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Registration Statement, each Prospectus included therein or
filed with the SEC, and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Parent may require each Holder of Registrable Securities as to
which any registration is being effected to furnish Parent with such
information regarding such Person that is necessary to satisfy the disclosure
requirements relating to the registration and the distribution of such
securities under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder as Parent may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
Each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of any changes in the information set forth in the Registration
Statement after it is prepared regarding the Holder of Registrable Securities.
None of the information supplied (or to be supplied) by or on behalf of any of
the Accredited Equityholders for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Registration Statement or Prospectus will, at the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act (or with respect to
any post-effective amendments or supplements thereto, at the time such post-
effective amendments or supplements become effective under the Securities
Act), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. For the purposes of this Section 1.7, a "Holder of
Registrable Securities" refers solely to a holder of Registrable Securities as
of the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Parent may, by two (2) days prior written notice to all the Holders
of Registrable Securities (each, a "Blackout Notice"), (i) delay the filing of
the Registration Statement or a request for acceleration of the effective
date, or (ii) suspend the Registration Statement after effectiveness and
require that the Holders of Registrable Securities immediately cease sales of
shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, in each case for a period no
longer than fourteen (14) calendar days, in the event that (A) Parent is
engaged in any activity or transaction or preparations or negotiations for any
activity or transaction that Parent desires to keep confidential for business
reasons, if Parent determines in good faith that the public disclosure
requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in connection with the
Registration Statement would require at that time disclosure of such activity,
transaction, preparations or negotiations and such disclosure could result in
imminent and material harm to Parent or (B) any other event occurs that makes
any statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement, including
any document incorporated by reference therein, untrue or that requires the
making of any additions or changes in the Registration Statement in order to
make the statements therein not misleading provided,  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t13  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

however, that Parent shall only be permitted to avail itself of this right
twice in any 12-month period. If Parent suspends the Registration Statement
and requires the Holders of Registrable Securities to cease sales of shares
pursuant to this Section 1.7(e), Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the termination of the circumstance which entitled
Parent to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or reinstate
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and give written notice to all
Holders of Registrable Securities authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to
the Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the Prospectus included in
the Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of
the Securities Act, Parent shall enclose such revised Prospectus with the
notice to Holders of Registrable Securities given pursuant to this Section
1.7(e), and the Holders of Registrable Securities shall make no offers or
sales of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement other than by means of
such revised Prospectus. Parent need not specify the nature of the event
giving rise to any delay or suspension in any notice to Holders of Registrable
Securities and such Holders of Registrable Securities agree to treat and keep
the existence of such delay or suspension, as the case may be,
confidential. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Parent shall cause all Parent Shares received by Accredited
Equityholders to be listed on NASDAQ within one (1) Business Day after (i) the
Closing with respect to Parent Shares issued at the Closing, and (ii) the date
of issuance with respect to Parent Shares issued in connection with any
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.6(c), any indemnification claims pursuant to
Article 7 or any Earnout Payments. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)Parent shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with
compliance with its obligations under this Section 1.7, including all fees and
expenses in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, the
registering of the Registrable Securities, fees and expenses of compliance
with securities or "blue sky" Laws, transfer agent fees, the maintenance of
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and the listing of the Parent
Shares on NASDAQ, including all registration, filing, qualification, printing,
accounting and other fees and expenses except that Parent shall not be
responsible for the fees of the representatives of and counsel to, the
Accredited Equityholders, including those with respect to any review and
preparation of the Registration Statement (all of which shall be included in
the Equityholder Transaction Expenses or payable by the Representative out of
the Representative Reserve). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h)Parent shall, and Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to, cause each Company Equityholder that will receive Parent Shares in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to enter into a Lock-Up
and Liquidity Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
F. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.8 Treatment of Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Stockholders who have properly
demanded appraisal of, or dissenters' rights with respect to, their shares of
Company Stock ("Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who comply in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall not have such
shares converted as provided herein, but instead such Stockholders shall be
entitled to such rights (and only such rights) as are granted under Section
262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall
cease to exist, and except as otherwise provided by Law, each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other
than the rights granted  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t14  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Stockholders are not entitled
to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the rights of such
Stockholders under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time as set
forth in Section 1.4(a) or Section 1.4(b), as applicable. Prior to the
Closing, Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal or dissenters' rights with respect to Dissenting Shares ("Appraisal
Demands"), and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such Appraisal Demands, and any
settlements with respect thereto shall not be entered into without the prior
written consent of Representative and Parent (such consents not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). From and after the Closing,
the Representative shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Appraisal
Demands, whether such Appraisal Demands were commenced before or after the
Closing; provided that Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such Appraisal Demands, and any
settlements with respect thereto shall not be entered into without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed). After the Closing, Parent shall give the Representative
prompt written notice of any Appraisal Demands. Any payments to be made in
respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent and/or the Surviving
Company.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The
consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof (including the Escrow
Fund) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to Company Stock (including any rights to receive accrued but
unpaid dividends or any liquidation preference on Company Stock, if any), and,
from and after the Effective Time, the Stockholders shall cease to have any
rights with respect to the shares of Company Stock (including any rights to
receive any accrued but unpaid dividends or any liquidation preference on such
shares, if any) except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement
and, if applicable, the Escrow Agreement. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Company of
shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock
Certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving Company for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided and in accordance with this
Section 1.9. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.10 Lost Certificates. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and an indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, the Surviving Company and their Affiliates, against any claim that may
be made against any of them with respect to such Company Stock Certificate,
but without any bond (except as may be required by the Paying Agent), Parent
or the Surviving Company shall pay, or shall cause the Paying Agent or payroll
provider to pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate, the applicable Preferred Per Share Merger Consideration or Common
Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Stock
represented by such Company Stock Certificate as contemplated by this Article
1. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.11 Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company, the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent, the Representative and the
Company's payroll provider (as applicable)  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t15  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts payable under this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code, and any other applicable Tax Laws, that are set forth on the
Distribution Schedule or that the Parent is entitled to withhold as set forth
in the instructions in the Exchange Documentation. Any such withheld amount
shall be timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority and
treated as though it had been paid to the Person in respect of which such
withholding was required. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.12 Interest; No Liability. All payments made pursuant
to this Article 1, whether at the Closing or afterwards, shall be without
interest. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any cash or securities delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.13 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting
the other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that Company changes the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the consideration paid in accordance with this Agreement shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.14 Tax Treatment. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Mergers constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Each of the parties hereto adopts this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations. Both prior to and after the Closing,
each party's books and records shall be maintained, and all federal, state and
local income Tax Returns and schedules thereto of the parties hereto shall be
filed, in a manner consistent with the Mergers' being qualified as a merger
under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code (and comparable provisions of any
applicable state or local laws), except to the extent the Mergers are
determined in a final administrative or judicial decision not to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Code Section 368(a). \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Since the Parent Balance Sheet Date, and other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, there has not been, with
respect to Parent, any event, occurrence or development that has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material

Parent agrees to indemnify (including advancement of expenses) and hold

Company as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to Company's organizational
documents, any applicable employment agreements and indemnification agreements
and to the fullest extent under applicable Law for acts or omissions which
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Company's
organizational documents shall contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable to the past and
present officers and directors of Company as those provisions contained in
Company Charter and Company bylaws in effect on the date hereof, and such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
past and present officers and directors of Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)As of the Closing Date, Company shall have obtained and prepaid in
full, and Parent or the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, an officers' and
directors' liability insurance policy, an employment related practices
liability policy, and a fiduciary liability policy with respect to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time covering each past and
present officer and member of the Company Board who is currently covered by
Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy. The cost of
obtaining such "tail" insurance policies shall be included as a Stockholder
Transaction expense. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of Parent's or Surviving
Company's successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. \t\t

 \t\t

of Company and his or her heirs and representatives. The rights of all past
and present officers and directors of Company under this Section 5.10 are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract, applicable Law or
otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.12 Employment Matters. At or near the time of

offered, employment, effective as of and subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, to substantially all of the employees of Company, including certain
employees who are on a leave of absence or who are otherwise not actively at
work. All such  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t54  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

offers of employment shall be made in accordance with all applicable Laws and
shall offer base salary levels that are substantially similar to those which
were provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing, and Parent
shall offer benefits substantially similar to, at Parent's sole option, either
the benefits provided to employees of the Company immediately prior to Closing
or the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent at the time
such employment offers are made. Parent shall give each such Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee's employment with Company
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit, but not for
purposes of benefit accrual or entitlement (other than with respect to accrued
vacation, sick leave and similar paid time off benefits, which benefit
accruals Parent agrees to assume in amounts accrued by Continuing Employees as
of the Effective Date). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any welfare
benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) provide
each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.13 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of
the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,

carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the Mergers or any other
acts or transactions contemplated by this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.14 Maintenance and Prosecution of Company Intellectual
Property. During the period between the Effective Time and the Earnout
Termination Date, Parent shall, at its own cost and expense, maintain all
Company Intellectual Property in effect as of the date hereof and subject to
protection under the Laws of the United States, including but not limited to
paying any applicable filing fees, and shall prosecute any United States
Patent Applications included in the Company Intellectual Property. \t\t

been, or if it becomes apparent that any of such conditions will not be,

failure of the notifying party to perform or comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)subject to Section 7.2(b)(iv), no Parent Indemnitee shall be
entitled to any indemnification hereunder unless the aggregate of all Losses
relating to all breaches of such representations, warranties and covenants
would exceed on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $500,000 (the "Basket"),
in which case Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to seek compensation for
all such Losses in excess of the Basket; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)subject to Section 7.2(b)(v), the aggregate indemnification of
the Parent Indemnitees hereunder shall not exceed an amount (the "Cap") equal

Company or any Stockholder; provided, that the aggregate indemnification of
the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any and all
Losses  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t58  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

Equityholder multiplied by the Parent Trading Price at Delivery of Earnout
Statement, Parent Trading Price at Date of Accelerated Payment, Parent Trading
Price at Date of Product Approval, Parent Trading Price at Trial Enrollment,
or Parent Trading Price at Signing, or other applicable price per Parent Share
used by the parties to value such shares at the time of distribution of such
shares to such Company Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
further, however, that no Company Equityholder shall be responsible for any
indemnification relating to another Company Equityholder's (A) breach of any
Company Fundamental Representations or (B) fraud; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi)notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification, and no Company
Equityholder shall have any liability or obligation with respect to any

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise, from and after the Closing (but subject to the terms
and conditions of this Article 7), any indemnification of the Parent
Indemnitees for which the Company Equityholders are liable hereunder shall be
effected first, until the Escrow Fund is exhausted, solely and exclusively by
a payment made from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, next, only after the Escrow Fund have been exhausted, by setoff
against any payment obligations with respect any Earnout Payment to the extent
that such payments are then due and payable, and finally, only after the
Escrow Funds have been exhausted and all amounts of indemnifiable Losses have
been offset against any Earnout Payments then due and payable, directly
against a Company Equityholder, in each such case and for the avoidance of
doubt, subject to the Cap and other limitations set forth in this Agreement.
Any payments to Parent out of the Escrow Account shall consist of Parent
Shares (valued at the Parent Trading Price at Signing). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Representative
(solely in its capacity as the Representative) is a party to this Agreement
solely to perform certain administrative functions in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that other than any liability which any
Company Equityholder may have hereunder, Representative shall have no
additional liability to, and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any party
hereto or to any Parent Indemnitee in connection with any obligations of the
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to
the extent such Losses are a result of gross negligence or willful misconduct
by the Representative in connection with the performance of its obligations
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement. \t\t

(e)Losses that may be recovered pursuant to Section 7.2 shall take account of
and be reduced by (i) any amounts recovered by the Parent Indemnitees or the
Surviving Company pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification
agreement with any third party, (ii) any refund, credit or reduction in Tax
realized by such Parent Indemnitees or their Affiliates arising from the
incurrence or payment of such indemnifiable Losses (based upon the maximum
marginal federal, state or local tax rate applicable to such Persons), and
(iii) the amount of any insurance proceeds, contribution payments or
reimbursements actually received or receivable by the Parent Indemnitees in
respect thereof (each Person named and source identified in clauses (i)
through (iii), a "Collateral Source"). The Parent Indemnitees shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery from all Collateral Sources;
it being understood that the reasonable costs and expenses of exercising such
efforts shall be deemed Losses. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any
payment required under Section 7.2 is determined after payment out of the
Escrow Fund or the set off of any Earnout Payment of any amount otherwise
required to be paid to a Parent Indemnitee under this Article 7, the Parent
Indemnitees shall repay to the Company Equityholders, promptly after such
determination, any amount that the Company Equityholders would not have had to
pay pursuant to this Section 7.2(e) had such determination been made at the
time of such payment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)All payments under this Section 7.2 shall be treated by the parties
as an adjustment to the proceeds received by Preferred Stockholders and
Warrant Holders to the extent paid out of the Escrow Fund, and otherwise by
Company Equityholders pursuant to Article 1, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. \t\t

Company Equityholder's Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, stockholders, members, partners, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns (the "Equityholder Indemnitees")
harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable Equityholder Indemnitees
the amount of, any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting
from (a) a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement, and (b) any breach of any covenant
of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Annex 1 hereof. All payments under this Section 7.3 shall be
treated by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by the
Company Equityholders pursuant to Article 1. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise, from and after the Closing (but subject to the terms
and conditions of this Article 7), any indemnification of the Equityholder
Indemnitees for which the Parent is liable hereunder shall be paid promptly to
the Company Equityholders pursuant to their respective Fully Diluted Ownership
Percentage as set forth in the Distribution Schedule and any such payments
shall be payable in cash and Parent Shares (valued at the mean of the daily
volume weighted average prices of Parent Shares as reported on NASDAQ for the
ten (10) trading days immediately prior to the earlier of the date of issuance
of such Parent Shares or the public announcement (if any) of the underlying
facts or circumstances relating to the corresponding claim for indemnification
(subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization affecting the Parent Shares)),
with the allocation between cash and Parent Shares  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t60  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

at the discretion of Parent; provided, however, that (1) at least the Minimum
Share Consideration shall be paid in Parent Shares, and (2) all amounts
payable to non-Accredited Equityholders and Optionholders with respect to
their Company Stock and Options, respectively, shall be paid in cash. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.4 Expiration of Claims. The ability of any Parent
Indemnitee or Equityholder Indemnitee to receive indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, respectively, shall terminate upon expiration of
the applicable Survival Period (as set forth in Section 7.1), unless such
Parent Indemnitee or Equityholder Indemnitee, as applicable, has made, in good
faith, a proper claim (as described in Sections 7.5(a) and 7.6(a) below) for
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, respectively, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Article 7, prior to such termination date,
as applicable. If a Parent Indemnitee or an Equityholder Indemnitee has made,
in good faith, a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 or
Section 7.3, respectively, prior to such termination date, then such claim, if
then unresolved, shall not be extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set
forth in Section 7.1 (it being understood that any and all Losses arising
after the expiration of the Survival Period shall be recoverable (subject to
the limitations set forth herein) only upon notice specifically with respect
to such Losses properly given prior to the expiration of the Survival Period
in accordance with this Article 7). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.5 Inter-Party Claims.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)In order for a Parent Indemnitee or Equityholder Indemnitee to be
entitled to seek any indemnification provided for under this Agreement (such
party, the "Claiming Party"), such Claiming Party must notify the other party
or parties from whom such indemnification is sought (the "Defending Party"),
and, during the Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent, in writing promptly after the
Claiming Party becomes aware of the occurrence of the event giving rise to
such Claiming Party's claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable
detail the basis and, if available, the amount of Loss with respect to, such
claim (each, a "Demand"); provided, that failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Defending Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure or
the indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such
failure.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Upon receipt of a Demand by the Defending Party, such Defending
Party shall have thirty (30) days (the "Indemnity Notice Period"), to review
and respond by written notice to such Demand (the "Return Notice") to the
Claiming Party and if applicable, the Escrow Agent. If the Return Notice does
not contest the Demand, or if no Return Notice is delivered to the Claiming
Party by the expiration of the Indemnity Notice Period, then, (i) with respect
to a Demand made by Parent, payment shall be made in the order and priority
set forth in Section 7.2(c), and (ii) with respect to a Demand made by the
Equityholder Indemnified Parties, payment shall be made in accordance with
Section 7.3(b). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)If the Return Notice given by the Defending Party disputes the
claim or claims asserted in a Demand or the amount of Losses thereof (a
"Disputed Claim"), then the Claiming Party and the Defending Parties shall
make a reasonable good faith effort to resolve their differences for a period
of thirty (30) days following the receipt by the Claiming Party of the Return
Notice asserting a Disputed Claim. With respect to a Demand made by a Parent
Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall not disburse any Escrow Fund as to a
Disputed Claim until the final  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t61  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

adjudication of the Company Equityholders' liability to Parent. As soon as
practicable following the resolution of such Losses, and the return to Parent
of amounts necessary to satisfy any Losses resolved in Parent's favor, if any
and in the order and priority set forth in Section 7.2(c), all amounts
remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be paid to the Preferred Stockholders and
Warrant Holders pursuant to Section 1.4 and the Distribution Schedule;
provided, however, that such payment shall not occur prior to the expiration
of the Escrow Period. If the Claiming Party and the Defending Party are
unable to resolve the Disputed Claims through negotiations prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period, such Disputed Claims shall, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction. The Claiming Party shall have the burden of
proof in establishing the amount of Losses it has suffered. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.6 Third Party Claims.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)In order for a Claiming Party to seek any indemnification provided
for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by any third
party Person against the Claiming Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Claiming
Party must notify the Defending Party in writing, specifying in reasonable
detail the basis and, if available, the amount of Losses with respect to the
Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by such Claiming Party of notice of
the Third Party Claim (a "Notice of Third Party Claim"); provided that failure
to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Defending Party is
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure or the indemnification
obligations are materially increased as a result of such failure. Such Notice
of Third Party Claim shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant
documentation with respect to such Third Party Claim, including any summons,
complaint or other pleading that may have been served, any written demand or
any other document or instrument.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)If a Third Party Claim is made against a Claiming Party, the
Defending Party shall, at its expense, be entitled to participate in the
defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Defending Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Claiming Party (i) if within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Notice of
Third Party Claim, the Defending Party gives notice to the Claiming Party
stating the Defending Party's intention to do so and acknowledging that the
Defending Party shall indemnify the Claiming Party from and against all Losses
(to the extent finally determined to be required by, and subject to any
applicable limits provided in, this Article 7), that the Claiming Party
suffers from the Third Party Claim, or (ii) if the Defending Party does not
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to clause (i) of this
sentence, at any time that the Defending Party reasonably believes that the
Claiming Party has ceased to actively and diligently prosecute the defense of
such Third Party Claim. Should a Defending Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Defending Party shall under no
circumstances be liable to the Claiming Party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Claiming Party in connection with the defense thereof;
provided, that in the case that (A) there exists or is reasonably likely to
exist a conflict of interest that would make it unethical under applicable
rules of professional responsibility for the same counsel to represent both
the Claiming Party and the Defending Party, (B) the Defending Party fails to
actively and diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, (C)
such Third Party Claim relates to or otherwise arises in connection with any
criminal or material regulatory enforcement action, or (D) such Third Party
Claim is reasonably likely to result in an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Claiming Party or, in the reasonable discretion of the
Claiming Party, result in a Loss in excess of the dollar  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t62  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

amount available for indemnification pursuant to this Article 7 (the scenarios
described in clauses (A) - (D) are collectively referred to as "Conflicts"),
then the Defending Party shall be liable to the Claiming Party for reasonable
legal expenses of one legal counsel selected by the Claiming Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Defending Party subsequently incurred by the
Claiming Party in connection with the defense thereof (to the extent finally
determined to be required by, and subject to any applicable limits provided in
this Article 7). If the Defending Party assumes such defense, the Claiming
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Defending Party, it being understood, however, that the Defending Party shall
control such defense so long as the Third Party Claim does not involve a
Conflict, in which case the Claiming Party shall control such defense. If the
Defending Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, then all the parties
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim,
including by retaining and, upon the Defending Party's request, providing to
the Defending Party all records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. If the Defending Party assumes the defense of
any Third Party Claim, the Defending Party shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Claiming Party (which shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement or consenting to the
entry of a judgment with respect to such claim unless such settlement or
judgment (1) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Law or the
rights of any Person and has no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Claiming Party, and (2) expressly and unconditionally provides a
full and general release of the Claiming Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim. If the Claiming Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, then the Claiming Party shall obtain the
prior written consent of the Defending Party (which shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement or
consenting to the entry of a judgment with respect to such claim.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSolely for purposes of calculating indemnifiable Losses hereunder (but
not for purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement has occurred), any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements shall be disregarded. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.7 Exclusive Remedy. Each of the parties understands,
acknowledges and agrees that except for claims of or arising out of fraud, the
indemnification provisions of this Article 7 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for claims made after the Effective Time with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and that the
parties hereto shall have no other remedy or recourse with respect to any such
claims other than pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
this Article 7. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no party hereto
may avoid such limitation on liability by (x) seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, all of which are
hereby waived or (y) asserting or threatening any claim against any Person
(other than a Company Equityholder in a claim pursuant to Article 7) that is
not a party (or a successor to a party) for breaches of the representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement. PARENT, ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND EACH OF THE PARENT INDEMNITEES EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED
BY ANY STATUTE WHICH LIMITS THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN
CLAIMS. EACH OF THE PARENT INDEMNITEES UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
RELEASE OF UNKNOWN  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t63  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS.
EACH PARENT INDEMNITEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN
ESSENTIAL AND MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, no term or provision of this Agreement shall
limit or reduce any potential claims or remedies based on fraud and nothing
herein shall limit any claim that a Company Equityholder may have as a
stockholder of Parent whether or not the Company Equityholder's status as a
stockholder of Parent arose out of the receipt of the Parent Shares. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.8 Tax Matters.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company and the Surviving
Company that have not yet been filed as of the Closing Date, in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
Parent shall deliver to Representative all income Tax Returns for any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods (including Tax Returns for Straddle Periods) that are to
be filed after the Closing Date for review and comment no less than fifteen
(15) days before the applicable due date. Except to the extent that an
amendment or election would not result in an increase in liabilities for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall not, without the Representative's prior
written consent, cause or permit the Surviving Company to (i) amend any Tax
Return that relates in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii)
make any election that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)Except to the extent that such refund is attributable to the
carryback of a Tax attribute attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period or such
refund was included as an asset in Net Working Capital, the Company
Equityholders shall be entitled to any Tax refunds that are received by Parent
or the Surviving Company, and any amounts credited against Taxes to which
Parent or the Surviving Company become entitled in any Post-Closing Tax Period
of Company, that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, including Taxes paid
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of Company. Parent shall pay or cause
to be paid over to the Company Equityholder's (in accordance with each Company
Equityholder's Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage) any such refund or the
amount of any such credit within twenty (20) days after receipt of such refund
or after becoming entitled to such credit against Taxes. Any payment under
this Section 7.8(a) shall be considered a purchase price adjustment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Cooperation. The parties shall cooperate with each other to
provide each other with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by them
in connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns, any Tax audit or other
examination in connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding
involving a taxing authority relating to Taxes, and the enforcement of the
provisions of this Section 7.8(b). Such cooperation shall include, including
upon Representative's  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t64  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

request, providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such matters and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Transfer Taxes. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company
Equityholders, on the other hand, will each pay fifty percent (50%) of any
real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer tax, or other
similar Tax imposed on the Surviving Company or any Company Equityholder as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer
Taxes. Parent shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to Transfer Taxes (except to the extent such Tax Returns are
required by Law to be filed by a Company Equityholder), and Representative
agrees to cooperate with Parent in the filing of any such Tax Returns,
including promptly supplying any information in its possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such returns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Reorganization. Each of Company and Parent will report the Mergers
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Neither
Company nor Parent shall take or cause to be taken any action that could
prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Tax Covenants of Parent and Second Merger Sub. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Parent, either directly or through a member of Parent's "qualified
group" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)
(the "Qualified Group"), will continue at least one significant historic
business line of Company, or use at least a significant portion of the
historic business assets of Company in a business, in each case within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d), except that the historic
business assets of Company may be transferred (i) to a corporation that is
another member of Parent's Qualified Group, or (ii) to an entity subject to
federal income Tax as a partnership if (A) one or more members of Parent's
Qualified Group have active and substantial management functions as a partner
with respect to such historic business or historic business assets of Company,
or (B) members of Parent's Qualified Group in the aggregate own an interest in
the partnership representing a significant interest in the historic business
or historic business assets of Company, in each case within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)In connection with the Mergers, Parent will not reacquire, and
will not permit any Person that is a "related person" (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) to Parent to acquire, any Parent Shares
issued in connection with the Mergers, in exchange for any consideration other
than Parent Shares. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)Parent will not sell or otherwise dispose, and will not cause or
permit Surviving Company or any of Parent's other Affiliates to sell or
otherwise dispose, of any of the assets of Company acquired in the Mergers,
except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers
described in Section 368(a)(2)(C) of the Code or described and permitted in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k). \t\t

Section 7.9 Escrow Release. Subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, on the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date
(the "Escrow Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, release all remaining Escrow
Funds (and not distributed or distributable to the Representative in
accordance with Section 8.1(d) or subject to a pending indemnification claim
of a Parent Indemnitee) to the Preferred Stockholders and Warrant Holders
based on each Preferred Stockholder's and Warrant Holder's Proportionate Share
of such amount by electronic or book entry transfer of Parent Shares (any such
distribution, an "Escrow Distribution").  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.10 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when
requested by any party and at such requesting party's expense, any other party
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such
documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary
or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.11 Waiver of Conflicts. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
stockholders, partners, officers, employees, and Affiliates that the Company,
and not any of its individual Company Equityholders, is the client of Wyrick
Robbins Yates and Ponton LLP (the "Firm"). After the Closing, it is possible
that the Firm will represent the Company Equityholders, the Representative and
their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "Seller
Group") in connection with the transactions contemplated herein or in the
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Fund and any claims made thereunder pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Parent and Company hereby agree that
the Firm (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group after the Closing
in connection with issues that may arise under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the administration of the Escrow Fund and any claims that may be
made thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. After the
Closing, the Firm (or any successor) may serve as counsel to all or a portion
of the Seller Group or any director, stockholder, partner, officer, employee,
representative, or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each
of the parties hereto consents thereto, and waives any conflict of interest
arising from such representation, and each such party shall cause any
Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from
such representation. Each such party acknowledges that such consent and waiver
is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the parties have
consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in this
connection.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.12 Attorney-Client Privilege. Notwithstanding the
Merger, Parent and Company agree that neither Company nor Parent shall have
the right to assert the attorney-client privilege as to pre-Closing and post-
Closing communications between the Company Equityholders or Company (for
Company, only with respect to pre-Closing communications), on the one hand,
and its counsel, the Firm, on the other hand, to the extent that the
privileged communications relate to this Agreement or any of the ancillary
agreements or to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The parties
agree that only the Company Equityholders shall be entitled to assert or waive
such attorney-client privilege in connection with such communications
following the Closing. The files generated and maintained by the Firm as a
result of the Firm's representation of Company in connection with this
Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any of the transactions  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t66  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

contemplated hereby or thereby shall be and become the exclusive property of
the Company Equityholders and shall be segregated from the Firm's files
related to all other elements of its representation of Company prior to the
Closing (which shall remain the property of Company). The attorney-client
privilege may be waived on behalf of the Company Equityholders only by the
Representative. The foregoing shall not extend to (i) any communication
unrelated to this Agreement, any of the ancillary agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) communications between the
Company Equityholders or Company, on the one hand, and any Person other than
the Firm, on the other hand, or (iii) any post-Closing communications between
Company and the Firm or any other legal counsel. \t\t

 \t\t\tREPRESENTATIVE \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.1 Representative.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Effective upon and by virtue of the Required Stockholder Approval
and his, her or its acceptance of the consideration payable under the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, and without any further act of any of the
Company Equityholders, each Company Equityholder hereby appoints the
Representative as his, her or its attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf
of such Company Equityholder for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and any other agreements and documents executed or delivered in
connection with this Agreement. The Representative shall take such actions to
be taken by the Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
and any other agreements and documents executed or delivered in connection
with this Agreement and such other actions on behalf of such Company
Equityholder as it may deem necessary or appropriate in connection with or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including, without
limitation, (i) accepting service of process on the Company Equityholders,
(ii) executing and delivering this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any
other ancillary documents and negotiating and executing such amendments,
modifications, waivers or changes thereto as to which the Representative, in
its sole discretion, shall have consented (provided that any waiver or
amendment that shall adversely and disproportionately affect the rights or
obligations of any Company Equityholder as compared to other Company
Equityholders shall require the prior written consent of such Company
Equityholder), (iii) receiving or providing notices on behalf of the Company
Equityholders with respect to any matter or Actions arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, (iv) taking all actions and making all filings on behalf of
such Company Equityholders with any Governmental Authority or other Person
necessary to effect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (v) agreeing to, negotiating, entering into settlements and
compromises of, complying with orders of courts with respect to, and otherwise
administering and handling any claims under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement on behalf of such Company Equityholders, (vi) interpreting all terms
of this Agreement; (vii) instituting, prosecuting and/or defending lawsuits;
(viii) satisfying from the Escrow Account and the Representative Reserve
costs, expenses and/or liabilities incurred by the Representative in its
capacity as the Representative and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement
and/or the Escrow Agreement, (ix) in connection with any of the foregoing
actions, engaging and hiring accountants, auditors, appraisers, legal counsel
and other legal and financial experts as may be necessary and appropriate
properly to discharge the Representative's duties and obligations hereunder
and under the Escrow Agreement and (x) taking all other actions that are
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t67  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

either necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement. The Representative hereby accepts such appointment.
The appointment of the Representative as each Company Equityholder's attorney-
in-fact revokes any power of attorney heretofore granted that authorized any
other Person to represent such Company Equityholder with regard to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements or documents
executed or delivered in connection with this Agreement. The Representative
is the sole and exclusive representative of each of the Company Equityholders
for any purpose provided for by this Agreement. Representative shall be bound
by the same confidentiality restrictions binding Company pursuant to Section
5.7 provided, however, that the Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts based on contact information available to the
Representative to keep the Company Equityholders reasonably informed with
respect to actions of Representative pursuant to the authority granted
Representative under this Agreement which actions have a material impact on
the amounts payable to the Company Equityholders. Each Company Equityholder
shall promptly provide written notice to the Representative of any change of
address of such Company Equityholder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative
hereunder shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all
Company Equityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each
such Company Equityholder, and Parent and the Surviving Company may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Company
Equityholder. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Escrow Agent shall be
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Representative. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Certain Company Equityholders have entered into a letter agreement
with the Representative to provide direction to the Representative in
connection with the performance of its services under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (such Company Equityholders, included their individual
representatives, hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory Group"). Neither
the Representative and its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees) nor any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the "Representative Group") shall incur liability with respect
to any action taken or suffered by any Company Equityholder in reliance upon
any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document
believed by such Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by such
Company Equityholder (and shall have no responsibility to determine the
authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except the gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Representative Group. In
all questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the
Representative may rely on the advice of outside counsel, and the
Representative shall not be liable to any Company Equityholder for anything
done, omitted or suffered in good faith by Representative based on such
advice. No provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall require
the Representative to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement on
behalf of any Company Equityholders.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Each Company Equityholder shall severally, but not jointly (based
on such Company Equityholder's Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage), indemnify
the Representative  \t\t

 \t\t

Group and hold the Representative Group harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
on the part of the Representative Group and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Representative's duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel or
other advisors reasonably retained by the Representative. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Representative's standard hourly rates and all out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by the Representative in performing its duties
shall be borne first by the Preferred Stockholders and Warrant Holders out of
the Representative Reserve, second by the Preferred Stockholders and Warrant
Holders out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with their Proportionate Share,
third by the Company Equityholders paid in accordance with their respective
Fully Diluted Ownership Percentages of such fees and expenses out of any
Earnout Payment otherwise distributable to the Company Equityholders, and,
thereafter, directly from the Company Equityholders, in accordance with their
respective Fully Diluted Ownership Percentages. As soon as practicable
following the termination of all of the Representative's obligations related
to this Agreement and the transactions hereunder, as determined in the sole
discretion of the Representative, the Representative shall distribute the
remaining portion of the Representative Reserve (if any) to the Paying Agent
for prompt distribution to the Preferred Stockholders and Warrant Holders in
accordance with their Proportionate Share of such amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (any such distribution, a "Reserve
Distribution"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)The Representative Reserve shall be held in a segregated client

by the words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; and (c)
the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole. Unless the context otherwise requires, references
herein: (x) to Articles, Sections, Company Disclosure Schedules, Parent
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and
Company Disclosure Schedules, Parent Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other document
means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented
and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions
thereof and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from time to time
and includes any successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated
thereunder. This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party
drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.5 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.6 Severability. If any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. \t\t

 \t\t

Agreement and those in the Escrow Agreement, the Exhibits, Company Disclosure
Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Company
Disclosure Schedules) Parent Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the Parent Disclosure Schedules), and other

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.8 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their

assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.9 No Third-party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in
Article 7 or Section 5.10, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the

any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written
waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring
before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall
operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power
or privilege. \t\t

Licensees multiplied by (ii) the Per Unit Average Selling Price of such
Company Product.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tB. Commercial Milestone  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.For each Earnout Year, if the Company Revenue for such Earnout Year
exceeds the applicable Revenue Target for such Earnout Year (the "Commercial
Milestone"), Parent shall pay the Company Equityholders an amount equal to (i)
1.5 multiplied by (ii) (A) the Company Revenue for such Earnout Year minus (B)
the Revenue Target for such Earnout Year (each such payment a "Commercial
Milestone Payment"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.Parent shall provide the Representative (1) within forty-five (45)
days after the end of each calendar quarter, a written report indicating, on a
product-by-product and country-by-country basis, Parent's calculation of
Company Revenue and each component of Company Revenue, and (2) as soon as
reasonably practicable following the due date for Parent Group's release of
earnings for each Earnout Year, but no later than ten (10) Business Days after
such release, Parent's calculation of the applicable Commercial Milestone
Payment, if any, and information and data reflecting and demonstrating the
Company Revenue for such Earnout Year. All such amounts shall be expressed in
U.S. dollars, and such reports shall include the rates of exchange used to
convert to U.S. dollars from the currency in which such sales were made or
payments received.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.On or before the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date on
which the Representative accepts Parent's calculation of the Commercial
Milestone Payment (either by delivering written notice of acceptance to Parent
or deemed acceptance under paragraph 4 below) or the Commercial Milestone
Payment is finally determined under paragraph 4 below, Parent shall (i) pay to
the Paying Agent or payroll provider (in the case of Optionholders with
respect to their Options), who shall in turn pay to each Company Equityholder
such Company Equityholder's Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage of the cash
portion of such Commercial Milestone Payment, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, and (ii) deliver to each Accredited Equityholder a number of
Parent Shares (rounded up to the nearest share) equal to (A) such Company
Equityholder's Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage of the Parent Share portion
of such Commercial Milestone Payment divided by (B) the Parent Trading Price
at Delivery of Earnout Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.Parent shall, and shall cause its Parent Group to, keep complete,
true and accurate books of account and records showing the derivation of the
amounts of all Commercial Milestone Payments, including, without limitation,
on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, Parent's calculation of
Company Revenue and each component of Company Revenue. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Parent Group to, provide Representative and its Agents with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting
data and employees of Parent Group to the extent reasonably necessary to
verify  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

any Commercial Milestone Payment. If the Representative has any objections to
the statements described in Section E.2(2) above (each, an "Earnout
Statement"), the Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement setting
forth, in reasonable detail, its objections thereto (each, an "Earnout
Objection Statement"). If an Earnout Objection Statement is not delivered to
Parent within thirty (30) days after delivery of an Earnout Statement, such
Earnout Statement as prepared by Parent shall be deemed irrevocably accepted
by the Representative on behalf of the Company Equityholders and be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties and the Company Equityholders. The
Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
objections raised in any Earnout Objection Statement, but if they do not reach
a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of an Earnout
Objection Statement to Parent, any unresolved disputes shall be submitted to
an independent national accounting firm mutually selected by Parent and the
Representative (the "Earnout Accounting Firm"). In the event any such dispute
is submitted to the Earnout Accounting Firm, each party shall be permitted to
submit a statement setting forth its calculation of the applicable Commercial
Milestone Payment, together with such supporting documentation as it deems
appropriate, to the Earnout Accounting Firm. The Representative and Parent
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Earnout Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable, but in
any event within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Earnout
Accounting Firm receives the applicable statements prepared by the
Representative and Parent. The calculation of any Commercial Milestone
Payment as finally determined by the Earnout Accounting Firm (which such
determination shall be made in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and shall not, for any Commercial Milestone Payment, be less than
the amount set forth in the applicable Earnout Statement nor exceed the amount
set forth in the applicable Earnout Objection Statement) shall be final,
binding and non-appealable among the parties. Each party shall bear its own
costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute by the
Earnout Accounting Firm. All costs and expenses of the Earnout Accounting
Firm, if any, shall be paid by the parties proportionately based on the
difference of each party's calculation of the applicable Commercial Milestone
Payment as compared to the final determination of the Earnout Accounting Firm.
For example, if Parent proposes a Commercial Milestone Payment of $100, the
Representative proposes a Commercial Milestone Payment of $200, and the final
determination of the Earnout Accounting Firm is $160, then 60% of the costs of
the Earnout Accounting Firm's review would be borne by Parent and 40% of such
costs would be borne by the Representative (on behalf of the Company
Equityholders). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Earnout
Accounting Firm determines that the actual amount of any Commercial Milestone
Payment exceeds Parent's determination of such Commercial Milestone Payment by
five percent (5%) or more, then Parent shall pay all costs and expenses of the
Earnout Accounting Firm with respect to its resolution of the corresponding
dispute. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tC. Trial Enrollment Milestone \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.Upon completion of patient enrollment of the Converge Pivotal IDE
Trial by or on behalf of any member of Parent Group or any Licensee thereof
(the "Trial Enrollment Milestone"), Parent shall pay the Company Equityholders
the Trial Enrollment Milestone Payment.  \t\t

 \t\t

2.On or before the thirtieth (30th) day following enrollment of the final
patient in the Converge Pivotal IDE Trial, Parent shall (i) pay to the Paying
Agent or payroll provider (in the case of Optionholders with respect to their
Options), who shall in turn pay to each Company Equityholder such Company
Equityholder's Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage of the cash portion of such
Trial Enrollment Milestone Payment, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, and (ii) deliver to each Accredited Equityholder a number of Parent
Shares (rounded up to the nearest share) equal to (A) such Company
Equityholder's Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage of the Parent Share portion
of such Trial Enrollment Milestone Payment divided by (B) the Parent Trading
Price at Trial Enrollment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tD. Regulatory Milestone \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.If any member of Parent Group or any Licensee thereof receives
Product Approval on or before December 31, 2020 (the "Regulatory Milestone"),
Parent shall pay the Company Equityholders the Regulatory Milestone Payment.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.On or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the issuance of the
Product Approval, Parent shall (i) pay to the Paying Agent or payroll provider
(in the case of Optionholders with respect to their Options), who shall in
turn pay to each Company Equityholder such Company Equityholder's Fully
Diluted Ownership Percentage of the cash portion of such Regulatory Milestone
Payment, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and (ii) deliver to
each Accredited Equityholder a number of Parent Shares (rounded up to the
nearest share) equal to (A) such Company Equityholder's Fully Diluted
Ownership Percentage of the Parent Share portion of such Regulatory Milestone
Payment divided by (B) the Parent Trading Price at Date of Product
Approval. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tE. Parent Reports \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.As soon as practicable following the end of each calendar year
during the Earnout Period, but in any event within ninety (90) days thereof,
Parent shall deliver to the Representative a report (a "Parent Report")
summarizing Parent Group's activities with respect to Parent's efforts to
commercialize the Company Products and to conduct the Converge Pivotal IDE
Trial during the prior calendar year, including, among other things, the
following items: \t\t

to the Company Products, including any material change to Parent's

enrollment, conduct, completion and other activities relating to the Converge
Pivotal  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

Pivotal IDE Trial, including, among other things, any adverse events and post-

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tAt any time during the thirty (30) day period following delivery of a
Parent Report, either the Representative or Parent shall be entitled to
request a confidential meeting (a "Review Meeting") be held to review the
Parent Report and Parent Group's expenditures and activities during the year
covered by such Parent Report. Review Meetings may be held in person in
Cincinnati, Ohio unless otherwise agreed, and such meetings will be scheduled
and held within fifteen (15) days of the date that a request for a meeting is
given, in writing, by any of such persons. The Representative and other
representatives of the Stockholders may attend any such Review Meeting,
subject to their entry into of a confidentiality agreement in a form

 \t\t

 \t\t\tF. Acceleration \t\t

days prior written notice of any proposed Divestiture or Parent Change of
Control occurring on or before January 31, 2021 (the "Acceleration Notice"),
including, without limitation, the execution by Parent of any definitive
agreement, letter of intent or similar document contemplating such a
Divestiture or Parent Change of Control and (b) prompt written notice upon
closing or abandonment of any such Divestiture or Parent Change of Control.
Upon the later of (a) closing of such Divestiture or Parent Change of Control

Parent (or its successor) shall make the Accelerated Payment (as defined

(or its successor) shall continue to make any payments owed pursuant to the
Agreement, including, without limitation, this Annex 1; provided, however,
that any such payments shall be reduced (but not below zero), in the aggregate
and without duplication, in the order in which they are due and payable, by

actually paid (in cash or Parent Shares and valued at the applicable price per

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.Parent shall, prior to closing of such Divestiture or Parent Change
of Control, (a) make provision for the counterparty to such transaction to
assume and succeed to the obligations of Parent set forth in this Agreement,
including, without limitation, this Annex 1 and (b) prior to or simultaneously
with the consummation of any such transaction, cause such counterparty to
provide to the Representative an instrument of assumption in a reasonable form
for the benefit of the Company Equityholders effecting the assumption and
succession described in the foregoing clause (a), and proof satisfactory to
the Representative of such counterparty's financial capacity to assume
Parent's obligations set forth in this Annex 1; provided, that unless and
until Parent provides the assurances set forth in the foregoing clause (b),
Parent shall remain liable for the payment of Earnout Payments and the
performance of every duty, covenant or other obligation of Parent under this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tG. Miscellaneous. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.All payments required pursuant to this Annex 1 shall be deemed to be

otherwise required by applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (a) operate the
business of the Surviving Company in good faith with respect to achievement of
the Commercial Milestone, the Regulatory Milestone and the Trial Enrollment
Milestone, and (b) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell the Company
Products and to achieve the Regulatory Milestone and the Trial Enrollment
Milestone; provided, however, the obligation of Parent to use, or cause its
Affiliates to use, such Commercially Reasonable Efforts shall not be deemed a
guarantee or assurance of any kind that any Commercial Milestone Payment,
Regulatory Milestone Payment or Trial Enrollment Milestone will be earned or
paid. Except as specifically provided in this paragraph, from and after the
Effective Time, all decisions and efforts with respect to the operation or
conduct of business of the Surviving Company shall be in Parent's sole and
absolute discretion without any express or implied warranty or covenant of any
kind to any Stockholder or anyone else. The parties acknowledge and agree
that Parent and its Affiliates owe no fiduciary duty to the Company, the
Surviving Company or the Stockholders with respect to any Commercial Milestone
Payment, the Regulatory Milestone Payment or the Trial Enrollment Milestone
Payment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.If Parent does not pay any sum or transfer, or cause the Paying
Agent or payroll provider to pay or transfer, any Earnout Payments due to the
Company Equityholders on or before the date for payment or transfer thereof as
set forth in this Annex  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

1, simple interest shall thereafter accrue on such amount until the actual
date of payment or transfer at the per annum rate of ten percent (10%) over
the then-current prime rate of interest as published on that date in The Wall
Street Journal or the maximum rate allowable by applicable Law, whichever is
lower. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.At any time following the day that is twelve (12) months after any
Earnout Payment is due hereunder, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
