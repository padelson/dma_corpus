corporation (" **Parent** "), Topaz Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a **** wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" **Merger Sub** "),
and TippingPoint Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
**Company** ").

  



  

 ** _RECITALS_**

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " **Board** ") has
unanimously (i) determined that the Merger (as defined in _Section 1.1_) is
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the transactions
contemplated by the Company Voting Agreements (collectively, the "
**Transactions** "), and (iii) determined, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt and
approve this Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has (i) determined that the Merger
is advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, Parent and its
stockholders, and (ii) approved this Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition
and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders are entering into Voting Agreements in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " **Company Voting Agreements** ").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I** 
 THE MERGER

  

# ** **

  

## 1.1 _The Merger_.  At the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.2_)
and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (" **Delaware
Law** "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "
**Merger** "), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the
surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to
as the " **Surviving Corporation**."

  

   

     
   

  



  

## 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " **Certificate of
Merger** ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time of
such filing, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company
and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being the "
**Effective Time** ") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as
herein defined). The closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take
place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional
Corporation, 8911 Capital of Texas Highway North, Westech 360, Suite 3350,
Austin, Texas, at a time and date to be specified by the parties hereto,
which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions, which by their terms, are to be satisfied or waived on the
Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), or at such
other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "
**Closing Date** ").

  



  

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the assets, properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_ _of Surviving Corporation_.

  



  

#### (a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the
Company, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated to read the same as the Certificate of Incorporation
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject
to _Section 5.8_, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law
and such Certificate of Incorporation; _provided, however_ , that as of
the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation shall provide that the
name of the Surviving Corporation is "TippingPoint Technologies, Inc."

  

#### 

  

#### (b) _Bylaws_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company, the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to read the same as
the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to _Section 5.8_, until thereafter amended in accordance with
Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and such Bylaws; _provided, however_ , that all references in such Bylaws to
Merger Sub shall be amended to refer to "TippingPoint Technologies, Inc."

  

#### 

  

1.5 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corp_ _oration_.

  



  

#### (a) _Directors_. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

#### (b) _Officers_. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall
be the officers of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

#### 

  

1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, the following shall occur:

  



  

#### (a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (" **Company Common Stock** ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ and any
Dissenting Shares, as defined in _Section 1.7_), will be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive, upon
surrender of the certificate(s) representing such Company Common Stock in the
manner provided in _Section 1.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit, and bond, if required,
in the manner provided in _Section 1.10_), cash in an amount equal to $47.00
per share, without interest (the " **Per Share**   **Merger Consideration** "
and the aggregate of all Per Share Merger Consideration, the "
**Merger Consideration** "). If any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
the Company (" **Unvested Shares** "), then the portion of the Merger
Consideration issued in exchange for such Unvested Shares shall also be
unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition. The portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon
conversion of any Unvested Share shall be withheld by the Paying Agent and
paid by the Paying Agent to each such holder in accordance with the vesting
and other provisions set forth in the applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement, if applicable.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Company Common Stock held by the Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Common Stock** ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall evidence ownership
of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of outstanding options to
purchase Company Common Stock (the " **Company Stock Options** "), each
Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, and all stock option plans
or other equity-related plans of the Company, including the Fourth
Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (as amended,
the " **Company Stock Plans** "), insofar as they relate to Company Stock
Options, shall be assumed by

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

Parent and the Company Stock Options shall become an option to acquire shares
of the common stock of Parent, $0.001 par value per share (" **Parent Common
Stock** "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)
such assumed Company Stock Option shall be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock (such options, " **Parent Stock Options**
") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock) obtained by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio (as
defined herein), and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock
Options shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock
for which the Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio. As promptly as practicable after
the Closing Date, Parent shall issue to each holder of an outstanding Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time a document evidencing
the foregoing assumption of such Company Stock Option. The " **Option
Exchange Ratio** " shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing $47.00 by the
Parent Stock Price.  The " **Parent Stock Price** " shall mean the average
of the closing sale prices for a share of Parent Common Stock as quoted on
the Nasdaq National Market (" **Nasdaq** ") for the five (5) consecutive
trading days ending with the second trading day that precedes the Closing
Date.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated 2000 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the " **Company ESPP** ") in order to shorten each
currently ongoing purchase and/or offering period under such plan which
extends beyond the Effective Time (the " **Current Offerings** ") such that a
new purchase date for each such Current Offering shall occur prior to the
Effective Time and Company Common Stock shall be purchased by the Company
ESPP participants prior to the Effective Time and all administrative actions
required to transfer ownership of Company Common Stock shall have been
completed.  The Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the earlier
of (i) the Effective Time, or (ii) the date upon which the Company ESPP
terminates by its terms. Subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall take no action, pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP, to
commence any new purchase and/or offering period. Prior to the date of the
termination of the Company ESPP, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that the Company ESPP will be terminated pursuant to duly adopted
resolutions of the Board (which resolutions shall be subject to the prior
written approval of Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

  

#### 

  

1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

#### (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have not voted in
favor of the Merger and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal
for such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law
(collectively, the " **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration payable
for each such share of Company Common Stock. Such stockholders shall be
entitled to receive payment of the

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

appraised value of such Company Common Stock held by them in accordance with
the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Company Common Stock
under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into,
and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration payable for each such share of
Company Common Stock, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in
the manner provided in _Section 1.8_, of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Company Common Stock.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  

#### 

  

1.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

  



  

#### (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " **Paying Agent** ") for the holders of Company Common Stock to receive
the portion of the Merger Consideration to which holders of Company Common
Stock shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_. Such funds shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the " **Certificates**
"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
portion of the Merger Consideration payable for such Company Common Stock,
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and approved by the Company
prior to the Effective Time (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall contain such other
provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender
of said Certificates. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
formerly representing the Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the portion of the Merger Consideration payable for such
shares of Company Common Stock, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates shall
be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence only the ownership of the respective portion of the Merger
Consideration to which the record holder of such Certificate is entitled by
virtue thereof. Promptly following surrender of any such Certificates and the
duly executed letters of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the
record holders thereof, without interest, the

contingencies (as such term is used in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5 (" **Statement No. 5** ") issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board in March 1975) that are not adequately provided for in the
balance sheet as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date (the " **Interim Balance
Sheet** ") as required by Statement No. 5. The Financial Statements comply

#### 

  

#### (d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Companys consolidated cash,

#### 

  

#### (e) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material
information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company and
the subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Company required by Section 302 of the

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" **SOX** ") with respect to such reports.
For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
SOX. Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of
SOX and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the
SEC Reports.  Based on the most recent evaluation by the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there are no "significant
deficiencies" in the design or operation of the Companys internal controls
and procedures which could adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data or any "material weaknesses" in
the Companys internal controls. As used in this section, a
"significant deficiency" in controls means a control deficiency that
adversely affects the Companys ability to initiate, authorize, record,
process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP.
A "significant deficiency" may be a single deficiency or a combination of
deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than
inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. As used in this section, a
"material weakness" in controls means a significant deficiency, or a
combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected. To the Companys knowledge,
there is no fraud, whether or not material, that involves any Employee (as
defined in _Section 2.11(a)(v)_ ) who has a significant role in the Companys
internal controls and procedures.

  

#### 

  

#### (f) To the Companys knowledge, (KPMG LLP, which has expressed its
opinion with respect to the financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries as of January 31, 2004, January 31, 2003 and December 31, 2001
and for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended
January 31, 2004 included in the SEC Reports (including the related notes),
is "independent" (under applicable rules then in effect) with respect to the
Company and each of its subsidiaries within the meaning of Regulation S-X
since the appointment of KPMG LLP in that capacity. The Company is in
compliance with the applicable criteria for continued listing of the Company
Common Stock on Nasdaq and has not since January 1, 2002 received any notice
from Nasdaq asserting any non-compliance with such rules and regulations.

  

#### 

  

#### (g) To the knowledge of the Company, no attorney representing the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, or Employee has reported to the Board or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent
conduct or similar violation by an Employee or agent (while acting in that
capacity).

#### (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall prepare, and file with the SEC, preliminary proxy materials
relating to the Company Stockholder Approval. Parent shall provide promptly
to the Company such information concerning Parent as, in the reasonable
judgment of Parent, the Company or their respective counsel, may be required
or appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or in any amendments or
supplements thereto. At the earliest practicable time following the later of

will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities in
connection with the Merger (or as required or appropriate to facilitate the
Merger) to comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Prior to filing the preliminary proxy materials,
definitive proxy materials or any other filing with the SEC or any other
Governmental Entity, the Company shall provide Parent (which term shall in
all instances in this _Section 5.1_ also include Parents counsel) with
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such filing in advance
and the Company shall in good faith consider including in such filings all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

  

####

other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or any other filing or for additional/supplemental information, and
will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or
any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any
other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy

shall permit Parent and its outside counsel to participate in all
communications with the SEC and its staff (including all meetings and
telephone conferences) relating to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or the
Merger.  The Company shall consult with Parent prior to responding to any
comments or inquiries by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to any filings related to (or necessary or appropriate to facilitate)
the Merger, shall provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any such written response in advance and shall in good faith
consider including in such response all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any other filing, the
Company shall

  



  

46

extent permissible under applicable law) within 45 days after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC (or if no SEC comments are received on or
prior to the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule

initial filing). Subject to _Section 5.4(d)_ , the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and shall take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or Delaware Law to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting to

the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders in advance of a
vote on this Agreement or, if as of the time for which the Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Stockholders Meeting.  The Company shall ensure that the Stockholders

the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company
and its current or former directors and officers (the " **Indemnified
Parties** ") in effect on the date hereof and listed on the Company
Disclosure Letter, and any indemnification provisions under the Company
Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least
as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Company
Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties or individuals who, immediately prior

53   

     
   

  



  

#### (b) At any time prior to the Closing, the Company may purchase, for a

not to exceed the amount set forth on _Section 5.8(b)_ of the

Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy, on
terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of
the Company, and covering all periods prior to the Effective Time (the "
**Tail Coverage** "). As soon as practicable following the Closing, in the
event Company shall not have purchased the Tail Coverage, Parent shall
(or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) purchase the Tail Coverage,
_provided_  that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in the aggregate in connection with the purchase of such
Tail Coverage an amount in excess of the Cap Amount and, in the event a
comparable level of directors and officers liability Tail Coverage is not
readily available for the Cap Amount without undue effort or expense, Parent
(or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be) shall only be obligated to
purchase such Tail Coverage as may be purchased for the Cap Amount.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) This _Section 5.8_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and
to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving

5.9 _Regulatory Filings_.

  



  

#### (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly after the execution of

Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall, as soon as practicable, make any initial filings
required under the HSR Act, and as promptly as practicable make any other
additional filings required by any other applicable Antitrust Laws (as
defined herein).  The parties shall consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any foreign
or other Antitrust Law; _provided_ , that with respect to any such analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or
proposals, each of Parent and the Company need not supply the other (or its
counsel) with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the
extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Entity applicable to such party requires such party or its subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information.

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

#### (b) Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of:  (i)
any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with
any filings made pursuant hereto, and (ii) any request by any officials of
any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made
pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with,
any Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to _Section
5.9(a)_, each party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or
supplement.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any

Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, Council Regulation
139/2004 of the European Commission, and any other federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " **Antitrust Laws** ").
Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to
take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such
transactions as promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement. Parent and the Company shall take any and all of the following
actions to the extent necessary to obtain the approval of any Governmental
Entity with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable laws
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby: (i) entering into
negotiations; (ii) providing information required by law or governmental
regulation; and (iii) substantially complying with any "second request" for
information pursuant to the Antitrust Laws.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Antitrust Law, it is expressly understood and agreed
that:  (i) Parent shall not have any obligation to litigate or contest
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent; and (ii) Parent shall be under no obligation to make proposals,
execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for a
Divestiture.  " **Divestiture** " shall mean (A) the sale, license or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent or any of its
affiliates or the Company, (B) the imposition of any limitation or
restriction on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely
conduct their business or the Companys business or own such assets, or (C)
the holding separate of the shares of Company Common Stock or any limitation
or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to exercise
full rights of ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.9_ shall limit a partys right to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_  so long as such party
has until such date complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.9_.

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

5.10 _Termination of Certain Benefit Plans_. Effective no later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any and all group severance,
separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements and any and
all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless
Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall
not be terminated) (collectively, for purposes of this _Section 5.10_ "
**Company Employee Plans** "). Unless Parent provides such written notice
to the Company, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company
Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board.
The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to advance review
and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).  The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance
of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably
require.

  



  

5.11 _Employee Benefits_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who
remain employed after the Effective Time (each, a " **Transferred Company
Employee** " and collectively, the " **Transferred Company Employees** ")
with similar types and levels of employee benefits as those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent; provided that nothing herein shall
preclude Parent from maintaining one or more of the Companys benefit plans
and programs for a transition period following the Effective Time. Parent
shall treat and cause its applicable benefit plans to treat the service of
Transferred Company Employees with the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company prior to the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or any
affiliate of Parent for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in
Parent benefit plans, including applicability of minimum waiting periods for
participation. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
that no Transferred Company Employee, or any of his or her eligible
dependents, who, at the Effective Time, are participating in the Company
group health plan shall be excluded from the Parents group plan (unless
covered under one of the Companys group health plans), or limited in
coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting period restriction or pre-
existing condition limitation; _provided_ that such Transferred Employees are
based in the United States and meet applicable actively at work requirements
as of the Effective Time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be
required to provide any coverage, benefits, or credit inconsistent with the
terms of Parent benefit plans or under circumstances in which such coverage,
benefits or credit would result in a duplication of benefits.

  



  

5.12 _Form S-8 Filing_. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of Parent Stock Options resulting from the
assumption of Company Stock Options in accordance with _Section 1.6(d)_ for
which registration on Form S-8 is available as soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event, within 30 days after the Closing Date.

  



  

5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Provided that the Company delivers to Parent
the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable law) to cause any disposition of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I of this
Agreement by each

Company Insider to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. " **Section 16 Information** " shall mean information regarding the
Company Insiders (as defined below), the number of shares of Company Common
Stock held by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for cash
in connection with the Merger, and the number and description of the Company
Options held by each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into
cash in connection with the Merger. " **Company Insiders** " shall mean those
individuals who are subject to the reporting requirement of Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

  



  

5.14 _Formation of Merger Sub_. Parent shall duly form Merger Sub as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent incorporated in Delaware and shall cause
Merger Sub to execute and deliver this Agreement prior to the Closing. For
the avoidance of doubt, the failure of Merger Sub to sign this Agreement on
the date hereof shall not call into question the binding and enforceable
nature of this Agreement among those parties who have executed and delivered
this Agreement as of the date hereof. Parent shall cause the board of
directors of Merger Sub to approve and adopt this Agreement and shall vote
its shares or consent in writing to the adoption of this Agreement in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

willful or intentional breach of, or any intentional misrepresentation made
in, this Agreement) under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is

entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, for any such
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_ shall not constitute

its assets, or against any Employees or stockholders of the Company, with
respect to any such termination of this Agreement based upon the willful or
intentional breach or intentional misrepresentation of any
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company in this Agreement,
and shall not constitute the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
such termination of this Agreement based upon the willful or intentional
breach or misrepresentation of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants of the Company in this Agreement.

understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

8.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiar_ _ies_. This Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Letter, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement

rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided in _Section
5.8_.

  



  

8.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

8.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_.  Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing
in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to
specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of
the United States of America located within Newcastle County in the State of
Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
thereof, that it is not

  



  

67   

     
   

  



  

subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section 8.2_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.
With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie
solely in Newcastle County, Delaware.

  



  

8.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefor, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

  



  

8.10 _Assignment_. No party may assign or delegate, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, either this Agreement or any of the rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent
shall be null and void, except that Parent may assign its rights (but not its
obligations) under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent without the prior written consent of the Company.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND MERGER SUB
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT,
COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
