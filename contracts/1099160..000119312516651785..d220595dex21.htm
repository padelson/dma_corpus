those conditions at such time), unless another time, date or place is
mutually agreed to in writing by the parties. The date on which the Closing

Section 1.3 _Effective Time; Effects of the Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
immediately following the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause

Section 1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Conversion of_ _MergerCo_ _Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger

stock of MergerCo shall thereafter represent ownership of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Conversion of Company Shares_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, including _Section 1.8_ , each
share of Company Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the

distributed to Stockholders pursuant to _Section 1.7(e)_ and _Section
8.12(b)_.

 

Section 1.7 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) At least three (and no more than 10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a certificate, executed on its
behalf by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, prepared in good faith
setting forth in reasonable detail (including a balance sheet showing the
calculation of Net Working Capital) ( _1_ ) its estimate prepared in
accordance with the accounting principles set forth on _Exhibit E_ of the
Purchase Price (and the following components thereof) (the " _Estimated
Purchase Price_ "), which shall equal the Base Merger Consideration, _minus _
( _i_ ) _ _ the estimated amount of Closing Date Indebtedness, _minus_ ( _ii_
) the estimated aggregate amount of the Unpaid Transaction Expenses, _plus_ (
_iii_ ) _ _ the estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment (which may be a
negative number), _plus_ ( _iv_ ) the estimated amount of Cash and Cash
Equivalents, _minus_ ( _v_ ) the Holdback Amount, _minus_ ( _vi_ ) the Pension
Adjustment Amount, _minus_  ( _vii_ ) the Representative Fund Amount, _minus_
( _viii_ ) the

 



3  Closing Tower Adjustment Amount and ( _2_ ) the amounts of each of Cash
Consideration and Common Stock Consideration payable to each Stockholder in
respect of its Pro Rata Portion of the Closing Merger Consideration (the "
_Closing Statement_ ").

(b) _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or shall cause
MergerCo or the Surviving Corporation to pay, in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, as follows:

 

(i) the Cash Consideration payable to each holder of Company Stock, as set
forth in the Closing Statement, to the accounts designated by the Company for
each Stockholder at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

(ii) the amounts set forth in the applicable payoff letters provided to Buyer
pursuant to _Section 4.17_ to the holders of the Closing Date Indebtedness
named therein;

 

(iii) the amounts set forth on the Closing Statement to satisfy the Unpaid
Transaction Expenses designated by the Company; provided, with respect to the
service providers listed on _Schedule 1.7(b)(iii)_ , the Company shall provide
to Buyer final invoices for any Unpaid Transaction Expenses payable to such
service providers at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date;
provided, further, that the Company hereby agrees that, to the extent
available, it will use any available Cash and Cash Equivalents to pay expenses
which would otherwise become Unpaid Transaction Expenses to the extent they
remain unpaid as of the opening of business on the Closing Date; and

(iv) the Representative Fund Amount to the account designated by the
Stockholders Representative at least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

(c) _Non-Cash Consideration_. At the Closing, Buyer shall:

(i) issue and deliver to each Stockholder who is receiving
Stock Consideration (the " _Continuing Stockholders_ ") and who has executed
and delivered to Buyer a sophisticated investor letter, in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit G,_ that number of Buyer Common Shares set forth next to
such Continuing Stockholders name under the column "Closing Stock
Consideration" on the Closing Statement; and

 

(ii) deposit in the Holdback Escrow Account, a number of shares equal to the
Holdback Amount, in the amounts and names of the Stockholders as set forth
next to such Continuing Stockholders name under the column "Holdback Amount"
on the Closing Statement.

 



4 (d) _Determination of Final Purchase Price_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than 90 days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative proposed
calculations, prepared in accordance with the accounting principles set forth
on _Exhibit E_ of ( _A_ ) Net Working Capital and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment, including a balance sheet showing the calculation of Net Working
Capital, ( _B_ ) the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, ( _C_ ) the amount
of Closing Date Indebtedness, ( _D_ ) the amount of Unpaid Transaction
Expenses and, based on the foregoing, ( _E_ ) the Purchase Price (which
calculations shall collectively be referred to herein as the " _Final Closing
Date Calculations_ ").

 

(ii) If the Stockholders Representative does not give written notice of any
dispute (a " _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within 45 days of
receiving the Final Closing Date Calculations, the Final Closing Date
Calculations shall be final and binding on the parties and shall be deemed to
set forth the final Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing
Date Indebtedness, Unpaid Transaction Expenses and Purchase Price, in each
case, for purposes of determining the Actual Adjustment Amount. Prior to the
end of such 45-day period, the Stockholders Representative may accept the
Final Closing Date Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to
Buyer, in which case the Purchase Price will be finally determined when such
notice is given. If the Stockholders Representative delivers a
Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer within such 45-day period, Buyer and
the Stockholders Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve only such disputed items during the 30-day period commencing on the
date Buyer receives the Purchase Price Dispute Notice from the Stockholders
Representative. The Purchase Price Dispute Notice shall set forth the
Stockholders Representatives calculation of each disputed amount in
reasonable detail. If the Stockholders Representative and Buyer do not agree
upon a final resolution with respect to such disputed items within such 30-day
period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be submitted immediately to
a nationally recognized, independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and the Stockholders Representative (in either case, the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall be requested to render a determination of
the applicable dispute within 30 days after referral of the matter to such
Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The terms of appointment and engagement
of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon between the Stockholders
Representative and Buyer, and any associated engagement fees shall be
initially borne 50% by the Stockholders Representative and 50% by Buyer;
_provided_ that such fees shall ultimately be borne by the Stockholders
Representative and Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters
resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be

 



5  determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the
Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the disputed items. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by
the parties hereto in connection with resolving any dispute pursuant to this
_Section 1.7_ before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party incurring
such cost and expense. In resolving the disputed items, the Accounting Firm (
_A_ ) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section 1.7_ (and the
definitions of defined terms), ( _B_ ) may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or the Stockholders
Representative, and ( _C_ ) shall limit its decision to such items as are in
dispute and to only those adjustments as are necessary for the Final Closing
Date Calculations to be prepared in accordance with the accounting principles
set forth on _Exhibit E_ and to comply with other the provisions of this
Agreement. Such determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties hereto. The Final Closing Date Calculations shall be
revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto
pursuant to this _Section 1.7(d)(ii)_ and, as so revised, such Final Closing
Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Net Working Capital,
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Indebtedness, Unpaid Transaction
Expenses and Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes hereunder
(including the determination of the Actual Adjustment Amount).

(iii) Following Buyers delivery of the Final Closing Date Calculations,
until finally resolved pursuant to this _Section 1.7(d)_, Buyer shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make the Surviving Corporations
financial records relevant to the Final Closing Date Calculations available
to the Stockholders Representative and its accountants and other
representatives upon reasonable notice during normal business hours during the
review by the Stockholders Representative of, and the resolution of any
objections with respect to, the Final Closing Date Calculations.

(e) _Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment Amount is positive, Buyer shall, within three
Business Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.7_ , issue and deliver to each
Stockholder Additional Shares having a value (based on the Buyer Common Share
Value) equal to its Pro Rata Portion of the Actual Adjustment Amount, or at
Buyers election, in lieu of delivering additional Buyer Common Shares, Buyer
may pay to each Stockholder all or a portion of its Pro Rata Portion of the
Actual Adjustment Amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the accounts designated by the Stockholders Representative. In
addition, Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the

 



6  Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to each Continuing
Stockholder the Buyer Common Shares set forth next to such Continuing
Stockholders name under the column "Holdback Amount" on the Closing
Statement.

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment Amount is negative, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 1.7_ , Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to: (A) if the absolute value of such negative amount equals or exceeds
the Holdback Amount, disburse to Buyer all of the Buyer Common Shares
comprising the Holdback Amount for immediate cancellation of such Buyer Common
Shares and (B) if the absolute value of such negative amount is less than the

Continuing Stockholders Buyer Common Shares) to deliver or cause to be

of which such deduction and withholding was made.

receivership or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (whether considered at law or in
equity).

by the Company and the performance of its obligations hereunder (including

benefit under, any provision of any Company Material Contract or any material
Permit affecting the Company or its Subsidiaries, except, in each case as

Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of the
Interim Financial Statements, for the absence of footnotes and other
presentation items and for normal year-end adjustments which are not expected
to be material in the aggregate), accurately reflect the books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and present fairly in all material respects
the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
the Company and its Subsidiaries at and for the respective periods indicated.

Section 2.7 _Company FCC Licenses_. 

(a) The Company or its Subsidiaries are the holders of the licenses, permits,
authorizations, and registrations set forth in  _Section 2.7_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. _Section 2.7_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth:
( _i_ ) all of the licenses,

 



13  permits, authorizations, and registrations issued by the FCC to the Company
or its Subsidiaries and ( _ii_ ) all of the licenses, permits, authorizations,
and registrations that are required to operate or are otherwise material to
the Companys business and, in each case, that relate to Communications Laws
((i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Company FCC Licenses_ "). Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries holds any license, permit, authorization,
or registration respecting any broadcast facility other than the stations
specifically identified in _Section 2.7_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) The Company FCC Licenses are in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms and have not been revoked, suspended, canceled, rescinded,
adversely modified, or terminated and have not expired. The Company Subsidiary
holding each Company FCC License is, under existing law and the existing
rules, regulations, policies and procedures of the FCC, qualified to do so and
to own and operate the facilities authorized thereby.

(c) _Section 2.7_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all
applications pending before the FCC and ( _i_ ) submitted by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or ( _ii_ ) respecting the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Company FCC License. To the Knowledge of the Company,
there are no facts or circumstances that might reasonably be expected to (
_i_ ) result in the FCCs refusal to renew any Company FCC License, ( _ii_ )
materially delay the FCCs renewal of any Company FCC License, ( _iii_ )
result in a challenge to any application seeking renewal of any Company FCC
License, ( _iv_ ) cause the FCC to impose a material condition or conditions

before the FCC to revoke, suspend, cancel, rescind or adversely modify any of
the Company FCC Licenses (other than proceedings to amend FCC rules of general
applicability). There is not issued, outstanding, or threatened in writing,
by or before the FCC, any order to show cause, notice of violation, notice of
apparent liability or order of forfeiture against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to: ( _i_ ) result in any
such action or ( _ii_ ) otherwise adversely affect Buyers ability to operate
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) The Company, each of its Subsidiaries, and their respective Transmission
Structures are operating in compliance in all material respects with the
Company FCC Licenses, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules, regulations, and published policies of the FCC (collectively, the "
_Communications Laws_ "). To the Companys Knowledge, no such Transmission
Structure is causing interference into any other broadcast station or
communications facility in violation of the Company FCC Licenses or
Communications Laws and, as of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written complaint alleging or respecting any
such interference. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof no
other broadcast

 



14  station or communications facility is causing interference into the
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that ( _i_ ) violates the
Company FCC Licenses or Communications Laws or ( _ii_ ) materially and
adversely impacts the ability of the public to receive transmissions from any
transmission facility owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All
material reports and filings required to be filed with the FCC by any member
of the Company Group with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of the Company FCC Licenses have been timely filed. All such reports and
filings are accurate and complete in all material respects. The Company and
Subsidiaries maintain appropriate public inspection files at each Company
Station location, as required by FCC rules.

Company Disclosure Letter, ( _iv_ ) liabilities arising under any
Company Material Contract (other than from breach thereof by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) and ( _v_ ) for liabilities which would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be materially
adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to the
ownership or use of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
incurred any liabilities or obligations that would be required by GAAP to be
disclosed or reflected in or reserved against in a consolidated audited
balance sheet or the notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP.

material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (
_ii_ ) there has been no Material Adverse Effect and ( _iii_ ) the Company has

32 ARTICLE 3

 

 __ _Representations and Warranties of the Buyer_ _Parties_

 

Except ( _a_ ) as set forth in the Buyer Disclosure Letter (it being
understood and agreed that each disclosure set forth in the Buyer Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed to qualify or modify each of the representations and
warranties set forth in this _Article 3_ to the extent the applicability of
the disclosure to such representation and warranty is reasonably
apparent from the text of the disclosure made) and ( _b_ ) as disclosed in
the Buyer SEC Documents that were publicly available on the website of the SEC
at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof and after December 31,
2014 ( _provided_ that nothing disclosed in such Buyer SEC Documents shall be
deemed to be a qualification of or a modification to the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.2_ , _Section 3.3_, _Section 3.10(b)_ or
_Section 3.16_ ), solely to the extent it is reasonably apparent solely from
the face of such disclosure that any such disclosure set forth in such Buyer
SEC Documents would qualify the applicable representations and warranties
contained herein, and other than disclosures in the "Risk Factors" sections
of any such filings and any other disclosures included in such filings that
are predictive or forward-looking in nature, Buyer hereby represents and
warrants to the Company as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date as follows:

Section 3.1 _Corporate Status_.

 

(a) Buyer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted. MergerCo is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted.
Buyer is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized) in all jurisdictions in which it
is required to be so qualified or in good standing, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Organizational Documents of Buyer is in full force and effect,
and Buyer is not in violation of any of the provisions of such documents other
than immaterial violations. Buyer has the corporate power and authority to own
and operate Buyers Stations, to use the Buyer Station assets and to carry on
the business of the Buyer Stations.

(b) MergerCo was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of MergerCo is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and is
owned, beneficially and of record, by an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
Buyer free and clear of all Liens.

(c) Except for ( _i_ ) obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with
its incorporation or organization, ( _ii_ ) this Agreement or in furtherance
of the transactions contemplated hereby and ( _iii_ ) as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Merger or the ability of MergerCo to fully perform its covenants and
obligations under this Agreement, MergerCo has not incurred, directly or
indirectly, through any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any obligations or
liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or
kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any
Person.

 



33 Section 3.2 _Corporate and Governmental Authorization_.

 

(a) Each Buyer Party has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and,
subject to the Buyer Stockholder Approval and the adoption of this Agreement
by the sole stockholder of MergerCo (which adoption will occur within 24 hours
of the execution of this Agreement), to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger). The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each Buyer Party and all of the Ancillary
Documents and Investor Agreements to be executed and delivered by either Buyer
Party to the Company, the performance of each Buyer Partys obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action of each Buyer Party
other than the Buyer Stockholder Approval and adoption of this Agreement by
the sole stockholder of MergerCo, and, other than obtaining the Buyer
Stockholder Approval and the adoption of this Agreement by the sole
stockholder of MergerCo, no additional corporate proceedings on the part of
any Buyer Party are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been, and at the time they are
executed and delivered each Ancillary Document to which a Buyer Party is a
party will be, duly executed and delivered by each applicable Buyer Party.
This Agreement does, and when executed the Ancillary Documents and Investor
Agreements to which a Buyer Party is a party will, constitute a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each such Buyer Party, enforceable against each such
Buyer Party in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, receivership or similar Laws relating to
or affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(whether considered at law or in equity).

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each Buyer
Party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) require no material action by or in respect of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority with respect to the Buyer Parties
other than ( _i_ ) the filing of 

 



34  the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, ( _ii_ )
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, ( _iii_ )
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Buyer FCC Licenses or
Communications Laws (including obtaining the FCC Consent), ( _iv_ ) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
other applicable U.S. federal or state securities Laws or "blue sky" Laws,
including the filing with the SEC of an information statement to be filed by
Buyer with respect to the Buyer Stockholder Approval (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Information Statement_ ") and ( _v_ )
any actions or filings under Law (other than the Laws referred to in clause
(ii), (iii) and (iv)) the absence of which would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair, prevent or materially
delay the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger).

 

(c) The affirmative vote of stockholders who collectively own a majority of
the outstanding shares of Buyers voting stock in favor of the issuance of
the Common Stock Consideration as required under the rules of NASDAQ (the "
_Buyer Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of Buyer necessary to approve the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by each Buyer Party and the performance of its obligations hereunder
(including the Merger) do not ( _i_ ) conflict with or breach any provision of
the Organizational Documents of either Buyer Party, ( _ii_ ) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in _Sections_ _ _ _3.2(b)_ and _(c)_
, conflict in any material respect with or materially breach any provision of
any Law applicable to either Buyer Party or any of their respective properties
or assets, ( _iii_ ) require any notice to or consent of or other action by
any Person under, constitute a default or an event that, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or cause or
permit termination, cancellation, amendment, acceleration or other change of
any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit under, any provision of any
Contract that is material to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any material
Permit affecting either Buyer Party, except in each case as would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be materially
adverse to Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to prevent or
materially delay the Closing or ( _iv_ ) result in the creation or imposition
of any material Lien other than Permitted Liens on any property or assets of
either Buyer Party.

 

Section 3.4 _Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of a
fully executed commitment letter dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Commitment Letter_ ") from Royal Bank of Canada and U.S. Bank National
Association pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources party thereto have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide
the debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein for the purposes
of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including

 



35  funding the Cash Consideration) and related fees and expenses. The debt
financing committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter is collectively referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Financing_." Buyer has delivered to the
Company true, complete and correct copies of any fee letters related to the
Commitment Letter, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction
solely of fee and other provisions that are customarily redacted in
connection with merger agreements of this type.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources party
thereto to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit such
Debt Financing Sources to reduce the total amount of the Financing. Assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ , _6.2_ and
_6.3_ , as of the date hereof, Buyer does not have any reason to believe that
it will be unable to satisfy (on the date on which the Closing is required to
occur pursuant to _Section 1.2_ ) all terms and conditions to be satisfied by
it in the Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Buyer
have knowledge as of the date hereof that any of the Debt Financing Sources
party thereto will not perform its obligations thereunder.

(c) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letter, the amount of funds to be provided pursuant to the
Financing, together with any cash-on-hand of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, shall
provide Buyer with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Buyers and MergerCos obligations under this
Agreement and under the Commitment Letter to pay ( _i_ ) the Cash
Consideration and ( _ii_ ) the fees and expenses of Buyer and MergerCo related
to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) The Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer
and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, and is in full
force and effect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent
on the part of Buyer under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter.
Buyer has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to
be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter on or before the date
of this Agreement, and will pay in full any additional amounts due on or
before the Closing Date. The Commitment Letter has not been modified, amended
or altered as of the date hereof and none of the commitments under the
Commitment Letter has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated as of
the date of this Agreement.

 

(e) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Buyer or any
Affiliate or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any
of Buyers or MergerCos obligations hereunder.

 



36 Section 3.5 _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article 2_ and that ( _a_ ) the conditions to the
obligation of Buyer and MergerCo to consummate the Merger have been satisfied
or waived and ( _b_ ) the Financial Statements fairly present the consolidated
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of the
periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby, then at and
immediately after the Effective Time, after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section_
_3.5_ , " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to any Person, that, as of any date
of determination:

(a) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of
the assets of such Person shall be greater than the total amount of such
Persons liabilities (contingent or otherwise) as of such date;

 

(b) such Person shall be able to pay its debts and obligations as of such date
in the ordinary course of business as they become due; and

 

(c) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital to carry on its businesses and all businesses in which it is about
to engage.

Section 3.6 _Litigation_.

 

(a) There is no Litigation pending against, or, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
threatened in writing against or affecting, either Buyer Party before any
court or arbitrator or any Governmental Authority which in any manner
challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin or materially delay the ability of
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger). 

(b) All material Litigation involving Buyer or its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof is disclosed in the Buyer SEC Documents.

 

Section 3.7 _FCC Licenses_.

 

(a) Buyer or its Subsidiaries are the holders of the licenses, permits,
authorizations, and registrations set forth in _Section 3.7_ of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter. _Section 3.7_ of the Buyer Disclosure Letter sets forth as
of the date hereof: ( _i_ ) all of the licenses, permits, authorizations, and
registrations issued by the FCC to Buyer or its Subsidiaries and ( _ii_ ) all
of the licenses, permits, authorizations, and registrations that are required
to operate or are otherwise material to the Buyers business ((i) and (ii)
collectively, the " _Buyer FCC Licenses_ "). Neither Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries holds any license, permit, authorization, or registration
respecting any broadcast facility other than the stations specifically
identified in _Section 3.7_ of the Buyer Disclosure Letter.

 



37 (b) The Buyer FCC Licenses are in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms and have not been revoked, suspended, canceled, rescinded,
adversely modified, or terminated and have not expired. The Buyer Subsidiary
holding each Buyer FCC License is, under existing law and the existing rules,
regulations, policies and procedures of the FCC, qualified to do so and to
own and operate the facilities authorized thereby.

(c) _Section 3.7_ of the Buyer Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date
hereof all applications, pending before the FCC and ( _i_ ) submitted by Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries or ( _ii_ ) respecting the Buyer, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Buyer FCC License. To the Knowledge of Buyer, there are
no facts or circumstances that might reasonably be expected to ( _i_ ) result
in the FCCs refusal to renew any Buyer FCC License, ( _ii_ ) materially delay
the FCCs renewal of any Buyer FCC License, ( _iii_ ) result in a challenge
to any application seeking renewal of any Buyer FCC License, ( _iv_ ) cause
the FCC to impose a material condition or conditions on its renewal of any
Buyer FCC License, or ( _v_ ) cause the FCC to renew any Buyer FCC License on
terms materially different than those in existence as of the date hereof.

(d) No action is pending or to Buyers Knowledge threatened by or before the
FCC to revoke, suspend, cancel, rescind or materially and adversely modify any
of the Buyer FCC Licenses (other than proceedings to amend FCC rules of
general applicability). There is not issued, outstanding, or threatened, by
or before the FCC, any order to show cause, notice of violation, notice of
apparent liability or order of forfeiture against Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to: ( _i_ ) result in any such
action or ( _ii_ ) otherwise materially and adversely affect the operations of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 3.8 _Buyer SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities; Financial
Statements, etc_.

 

(a) Buyer has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
required reports, schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses,

Commission (" _SEC_ ") (collectively and together with all documents filed on
a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case, including all exhibits
and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, as
have been supplemented, modified or amended since the time of filing, the "
_Buyer SEC Documents_ ") during the past three years. Each of the Buyer SEC
Documents, at the time of its filing or being furnished, complied, or if not
yet filed or furnished, will comply, in all material respects, with the
applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ") and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Buyer SEC Documents. As
of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the
date of such amendment), the Buyer SEC Documents did not, and any Buyer SEC

 



38  Documents filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

(b) Buyer has described in the Buyer SEC Documents and, to the extent
required by Law, filed with, the SEC all Contracts or other transactions,
agreements or binding arrangements between Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any ( _i_ ) Affiliate of Buyer, ( _ii_ ) Beasley Holder
or holder of more than 5 percent of Buyers Class A common stock, ( _iii_ )
Affiliate of any Beasley Holder or any holder of more than 5 percent of
Buyers Class A common stock or ( _iv_ ) officer or director of Buyer or any

_ii_ ) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
Buyers business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2015, (
_iii_ ) as set forth in _Section 3.8_ of the Buyer Disclosure Letter and (
_iv_ ) for liabilities which would not reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to be material to Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, since December 31, 2015, Buyer and its Subsidiaries have not incurred
any liabilities or obligations that would be required by GAAP to be disclosed
or reflected in or reserved against in a consolidated audited balance sheet
or the notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(d) The financial statements of Buyer (including any related notes and
schedules thereto) contained in or incorporated by reference into the Buyer
SEC Documents (the " _Buyer Financial Statements_ ") have been, or if
contained in Buyer SEC Documents that have not yet been filed or furnished,

(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited
interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the rules and regulations
of the SEC applicable to such Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). The Buyer
Financial Statements present, or if contained in Buyer SEC Documents that have
not yet been filed or furnished will, accurately reflect the books and records
of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries at and for the respective periods indicated (subject, in
the case of the unaudited financial statements included in the Buyer
Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments and any other adjustments
described therein and as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or
any successor or like form under the Exchange Act).

 

(e) Each of the principal executive officer of Buyer and the principal
financial officer of Buyer has made all certifications required by
Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Buyer SEC

 



39  Documents and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

(f) Buyer maintains a system of "internal controls over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as required
by Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of Buyer are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management, and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Buyers assets that could have an adverse effect on Buyers financial
statements. Buyer maintains disclosure controls and procedures within the
meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed and maintained to ensure that information
relating to Buyer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed in Buyers reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the Buyers principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others employed by Buyer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure under the Exchange Act and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Buyer has disclosed to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board
of Directors (A) any "significant deficiency" or "material weaknesses" (as
such terms are defined in Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X) in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect its ability to timely
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of
Buyer and its subsidiaries who have a significant role in its internal
controls over financial reporting.

(g) Buyer is in compliance in all material respects with the listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ applicable to Buyer.

to or from the FCC with respect to the FCC Applications, and relay the
substance of any oral communications from the FCC with respect to the FCC
Applications expeditiously upon receipt, ( _iv_ ) notify the other party or
party as soon as reasonably practicable in the event it becomes aware of any
other facts or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect the
issuance of the FCC Consent, ( _v_ ) oppose any petitions to deny or other
objections filed with respect to the FCC Applications and any requests for
reconsideration or judicial review of the FCC Consent to the extent such
petition, objection or request for reconsideration or review relates to such
party and ( _vi_ ) not knowingly take any action that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay, materially impede or prevent receipt of the FCC
Consent and its becoming a Final Order. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, each party will be solely responsible for the expenses
incurred by it in the preparation, filing and prosecution of its respective
portion(s) of the FCC Applications; however, the fees paid to the FCC in
conjunction with the FCC Applications will be split equally between Buyer and
the Company.

(d) Buyer agrees to take promptly all actions that are necessary
or reasonably advisable or as may be required by any Governmental Authority
to expeditiously consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including ( _A_ ) committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust or otherwise, selling, licensing or otherwise divesting of, or
holding separate and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, any
entities, assets or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any entity, facility or asset of Buyer or its Affiliates, ( _B_ )
terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships and contractual
rights and obligations (other than terminations that would result in a breach
of a contractual obligation to a third party) and ( _C_ ) amending, assigning
or terminating existing licenses or other agreements (other than terminations
that would result in a breach of a license or such other agreement with a
third party) and entering into such new licenses or other agreements, in each
case so long as such actions would not result in a Material Adverse Effect or
a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. In the event any claim, action, suit,
investigation or other proceeding by any Governmental Authority or
other Person is commenced which questions the validity or legality of the
transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the
parties hereto agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend 

 



52  against such claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding and, if
an injunction or other order is issued in any such action, suit or other
proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other
order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, ( _i_ )
nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to obligate Buyer, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to make, or to cause to
be made, any payment to any third party in order to obtain the consent or
approval of such third party under any Contract and ( _ii_ ) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be permitted to waive any right,
modify any Contract, or offer any accommodation or concession (financial or
otherwise) to any third party (other than payments of _de_ _minimis_ amounts)
in order to obtain the consent or approval of such third party under any
Contract without the consent of Buyer. With respect to any Company Material
Contract scheduled as an exception to _Section 2.3_ , the Company, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall each cooperate in good faith and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent prior to
the Closing.

 

Section 4.5 _Exclusive Dealing_. Other than as contemplated by _Section 4.13_
, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, take, nor shall it permit any of their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action
to solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information to or respond to any proposals or inquiries from,
or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than Buyer, MergerCo and/or
their respective Affiliates) (or authorize or consent to any of the foregoing
actions) concerning any direct or indirect purchase of beneficial ownership
of any of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries equity securities or any
merger, sale of substantial assets or similar transaction involving the
Company and its Subsidiaries, other than assets sold in the ordinary course
of business, in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ (each such acquisition
transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
each of Buyer and MergerCo hereby acknowledges that prior to the date of this
Agreement, the Company has provided information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and has afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with,
other Persons in connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Company has terminated access to the
electronic data room maintained by the Company and its advisors for every
third party except Buyer, MergerCo and their respective Affiliates, officers,
employees and advisors and has terminated any discussions regarding an
Acquisition Transaction with any such third party and has requested that each
such third party return to the Company or destroy all "Evaluation Material"
(as such term is defined by the confidentiality agreement between the Company
and such third party).

 



53 Section 4.6 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter for
12 months (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall provide, or shall
cause the Company and its Affiliates to provide, employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing who continue employment with the Company
following the Closing (the " _Company Employees_ ") with ( _i_ ) rates of
annual base salary or wage level and annual and target cash bonus
opportunities disclosed to Buyer prior to the date hereof (excluding
performance goals and the value of long-term incentives, to the extent
applicable) that are at least equal to that provided to each such Company
Employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, and ( _ii_ )
subject to the requirements of Buyers group health and welfare plan, employee
benefits (excluding long-term incentives, to the extent applicable) that are
no less favorable than the benefits and terms and conditions provided to each
such Company Employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing Date or provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the other provisions of
this _Section_ _4.6_ , nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the right of
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to ( _A_ ) terminate
the employment of any Company Employee at any time, ( _B_ ) change or modify
the terms or conditions of employment for any Company Employee or ( _C_ )
change or modify any employee benefit plan or arrangement.

(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Buyer, the Company and their
respective Affiliates in which Company Employees may be eligible to
participate during the Continuation Period (the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall be credited with the same amount of service as was
credited by the Company and its Affiliates as of the Closing under similar or
comparable Company Benefit Plans (including for purposes of eligibility
participation, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits);
_provided_ that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any benefit and shall not enable any Company
Employee to be entitled to receive any benefit under the New Benefit Plans
that would exceed any limitation of general application thereunder. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the
Continuation Period, ( _i_ ) with respect to any New Benefit Plans in which
the Company Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing,
each Company Employee will immediately be eligible to participate in such New
Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New
Benefit Plans replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately
before such commencement of participation (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Benefit Plans_ ") and ( _ii_ ) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical

 



54  and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions
or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or
comparable Company Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date. During the
Continuation Period, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law (including, but not limited to ERISA), use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year in which the Company Employee participates in the Old Benefit
Plans and ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the
corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Benefit Plan.

(c) With respect to any Company Employee whose employment is terminated by
Buyer during the Continuation Period or by the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates during the Continuation Period, Buyer shall provide, or
shall cause its Affiliates to provide, severance benefits to such Company
Employee, which shall be determined and payable in accordance with the
severance benefit plan or agreement maintained by the Company or any of its
Affiliates for the benefit of such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, taking into account such Company Employees period of
continuous service with the Company, Buyer and their respective Affiliates
immediately prior to such termination in determining the amount of severance
benefits payable.

 

(d) This _Section 4.6_ shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each
of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this  _Section 4.6_ ,
express or implied, shall confer on any other Person any rights or remedies of
any nature whatsoever. Nothing contained in this _Section 4.6_ shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set
forth in this _Section 4.6_ shall not create any right in any Company Employee
or any other Person to any continued employment with the Company, Buyer
or its Affiliates or any other Person or compensation or benefits of any
nature or kind whatsoever.

Section 4.7 _Director and Officer Liability, Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Buyer and MergerCo agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation
now existing in favor of the current and former directors, officers,
employees and agents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as provided
in their respective Organizational Documents or otherwise in effect as of the
date hereof with respect to any 

 



55  matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time and that the Company and its Subsidiaries will perform and
discharge their respective obligations to provide such indemnity and
exculpation after the Merger. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law, such indemnification shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and the
Surviving Corporation shall advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses actually incurred in connection with such indemnification as provided
in such entitys Organizational Documents or other applicable agreements; 
_provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification
or to the extent otherwise required by Law. For a period of six years from
the Effective Time, the indemnification and liability limitation or
exculpation provisions of the Companys and its Subsidiaries Organizational
Documents shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of
the Effective Time or at any time prior to the Effective Time, were directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
unless such modification is required by applicable Law.

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall purchase a "tail" policy
providing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the
benefit of those Persons who are covered by the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance policies as of the
date hereof or at the Effective Time with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time. Such policy shall provide coverage that is at least
equal to the coverage provided under the Companys and its Subsidiaries
current directors and officers liability insurance policies, underwritten by
one or more insurers with an A.M. Best rating no less than the A.M. Best
rating of the insurers of the current policies. Each of the Company and Buyer
shall pay 50% of the costs of such "tail" policy for such six-year period.
Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for a period of six years
after the Effective Time without any lapses in coverage, such policy in full
force and effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(c) The directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation,
exculpation and insurance set forth in this _Section 4.7_ are intended to be
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 4.7. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 4.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation.

Section 4.8 _Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take and cause to be taken,
all actions, and use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary,

 



56  proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable
taking into account customary blackout periods, but in any event, on or prior
to the End Date, including ( _i_ ) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letter
in accordance with its terms, ( _ii_ ) negotiating definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") on terms and
conditions (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any
related fee letter) that are no less favorable to Buyer in the aggregate than
those contained in the Commitment Letter (taking into account the exercise of
such "flex" provisions), ( _iii_ ) satisfying all conditions applicable to
Buyer or Merger Sub in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements at
or prior to the Closing that are within Buyers or any of its Affiliates
control (other than those conditions and obligations that are waived by the
Debt Financing Sources) and otherwise complying with its obligations
thereunder and ( _iv_ ) enforcing its rights under the Commitment Letter. In
the event that all conditions contained in any Commitment Letter and _Sections
6.1_ and _6.2_ of this Agreement have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived,
Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources to
comply with their respective obligations, including to fund the Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date. Buyer shall give the
Company prompt notice of ( _x_ ) any material breach by any party to the
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement of which Buyer has become aware
or ( _y_ ) or any termination of the Commitment Letter.

(i) Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company: ( _A_
) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or
remedy (i) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the
consummation of all or any portion of the Financing, ( _ii_ ) reduces the
amount of the Financing, ( _iii_ ) adversely affects the ability of Buyer to
enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Sources party to the Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights
against such Debt Financing Sources party to the Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof or in the Definitive Agreements or ( _iv_ ) could
otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, substantially impede or
substantially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer may without the prior written consent of the Company amend the
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book-runners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date of this Agreement (with any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Financing Sources" being deemed to include such additional parties) or ( _B_ )
terminate the Commitment Letter. Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Company
copies of any such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement after their
execution.

 



57 (ii) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Buyer will (
_1_ ) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the
Financing and any cash-on-hand of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses) on terms and conditions that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Buyer or the Company than those contained in the Commitment
Letter from the same or other sources and which do not include any conditions
to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous
than the conditions set forth in the Financing and ( _2_ ) promptly notify
the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative
financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Commitment Letter remaining
in effect at the time in question). Buyer shall provide the Company with
prompt notice of ( _1_ ) any material breach or default by any party to the
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements of which Buyer has become aware
and ( _2_ ) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication
from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or
the Definitive Agreements of any provision thereof, in each case, if such
breach or default would reasonably be expected to affect the timely
availability of, or the amount of, the Financing. Buyer shall keep the
Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Buyer
with this _Section 4.8(a)_ shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Financing is available.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take and cause its Subsidiaries and its representatives to, provide, such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with and
necessary for the arrangement of the Financing, including ( _i_ ) upon
reasonable advance notice by Buyer, participating at a reasonable time in a
customary bank meeting with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents
for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing and the members
of senior management of the Company, ( _ii_ ) reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or the Debt
Financing Sources and to provide guarantees and security documents and other
customary deliverables of the Company or its Subsidiaries (excluding for the
avoidance of doubt, any solvency certificate), provided that any related
obligation shall be effective no earlier than the Effective Time, ( _iii_ )
furnishing Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources

 



58  as promptly as reasonably practicable following the delivery of a written
request therefor to the Company by Buyer (which notice shall state with
specificity the information requested) with such financial and other
information regarding the Company as is customarily required of a subsidiary
in connection with the execution of financings of a type similar to the
Financing and as is reasonably requested by Buyer to consummate any portion
of the Financing (provided that the Company will have no obligation to
prepare pro forma financial information or post-closing financial
information), ( _iv_ ) assisting Buyer with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda,
bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents reasonably
necessary for any portion of the Financing, ( _v_ ) cooperating with Buyers
legal counsel with respect to any legal opinion that such legal counsel may
be required to deliver in connection with the Financing by providing necessary
supporting documentation, backup certificates, organizational documents, good
standings and incumbency certificates, ( _vi_ ) reasonably cooperating with
the marketing efforts of Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources for all or any
portion of the Financing, ( _vii_ ) using reasonable best efforts to provide
(A) documents reasonably requested by Buyer or the Debt Financing Sources
relating to the repayment of the existing Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the release of related Liens, including customary payoff
letters, lien releases and termination statements, and (B) documentation
and other information required by applicable bank regulatory authorities
under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Patriot Act and ( _viii_ ) cooperating with the
Debt Financing Sources due diligence investigation, to the extent customary
and reasonable; it being understood that the Company shall have satisfied its
obligations set forth in clauses ( _i_ ) through ( _viii_ ) of this sentence
unless there has occurred a willful and material breach of the Companys or
its Subsidiaries obligations under this _Section 4.8(b)_. The foregoing
notwithstanding, ( _A_ ) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries, nor
any Persons who are directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution
of the Financing or execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument
or agreement that is effective prior to the Effective Time or agree to any
change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or
agreement that is effective prior to the Effective Time, ( _B_ ) no obligation
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
representatives undertaken pursuant to the foregoing shall be effective until
the Effective Time and ( _C_ ) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any
of their respective representatives shall be required to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not
simultaneously reimbursed by Buyer in connection with the Financing prior to
the Closing. Nothing contained in this _Section 4.8(b)_  otherwise shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an
issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing. Buyer shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel and other advisors,
incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective 

 



59  representatives in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this
_Section_ _4.8_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and
all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Buyer pursuant to
this _Section 4.8(b)_ and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries), except
to the extent such losses arose out of or result from the fraud of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives.

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Financing. 

Section 4.9 _Notice of Certain Events_. During the period between the date
hereof and the Closing, each of the Company and Buyer shall promptly notify
the other of: ( _a_ ) any notice or other communication received by such party
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; ( _b_ )
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
( _c_ ) any Litigation commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company or
Buyer, as applicable, threatened that (1) if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed by such party
pursuant to this Agreement or (2) otherwise relates to this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and ( _d_ ) any (1)
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
(2) failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in each case that would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the other partys
obligation to close set forth in Article 6 not to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure of the Company or Buyer to give such notice shall
not constitute a breach of this Agreement and shall not affect the other
partys obligations to close the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.10 _Control of Company Stations_. Buyer shall not, directly or
indirectly, control, supervise or direct the operation of the Companys
business prior to Closing. Consistent with the Communications Laws, control,
supervision and direction of the operation of the Companys business prior to
Closing shall remain the responsibility of the holders of the Company FCC
Licenses.

Section 4.11 _Public Announcements_. Except as required by applicable Law or
the rules or regulations of any applicable stock exchange or Governmental
Authority to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall consult with and allow the
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, neither Buyer nor the Company shall make, or permit
any of its Affiliates or representatives to make, any public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated 

 



60  hereby without the prior written consent of the other party. The parties
shall mutually agree upon a joint press release to be issued on the date
hereof and at the Closing regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 4.12 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing Date,
at the request of another party, without further consideration, each of the
parties shall execute and deliver to such requesting party, or shall cause to
be executed and delivered to such requesting party, such additional
instruments or documents, and shall take or cause to be taken such other
action, as such requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate
more effectively the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.13 _Post-Signing Restructuring Actions_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall undertake any and all steps necessary or advisable to:

(a) consummate ( _i_ ) the sale of the radio towers owned by the Company and
its Subsidiaries set forth on _Section 4.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure

the Closing Date, the distribution of the Towers (and to the extent
contemplated by Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the related
real property) to the Stockholders, in which event, the Stockholders shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Tower Disposition as
promptly as practicable; _provided_ , that (x) the Company shall not include
any rights of indemnification against the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries in any agreement or conveyance
document to be entered into in connection with the Tower Disposition and

of 30 days following the date hereof and the consummation of the Tower
Disposition, the Company shall enter into agreements between the Company, on
the one hand, and its applicable Subsidiary that owns each Tower or related
real property, on the other hand, which agreements will be transferred to the
buyer in the Tower Disposition, pursuant to which the Towers following the
consummation of the Tower Disposition, shall have approximately the estimated
revenues, costs and expenses set forth on _Section 4.13(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and shall contain other terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and consistent with _Section 4.13(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter; and

(b) consummate the sale or winddown of the newspaper business operated by the
Company and its Subsidiaries, located in New Jersey (the " _Newspaper
Disposition_ "); _provided_ , that the Company shall not include any rights of
indemnification against the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in any agreement or document to be
entered into in connection with the Newspaper Disposition. In all cases, the
Stockholders

 



61  shall be entitled to receive 100% of the net cash proceeds from the
Newspaper Disposition, whether or not the Newspaper Disposition is consummated
prior to Closing. Any net cash proceeds from the Newspaper Disposition
received by the Company and or Surviving Corporation after the Closing will be
paid promptly by Buyer to the Stockholders in cash in immediately available
funds to the accounts designated by the Stockholders Representative.

promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between it (or
its representatives), on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Buyer
shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with
respect to the Information Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing the Information Statement or mailing the Information Statement or

shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such
document or response) and ( _ii_ ) shall consider in good faith all comments
reasonably proposed by the Company. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any information relating to Buyer or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be identified by Buyer or the
Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Information Statement, so that the Information Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary

_Section 7.1(g)_ in any circumstance in which the Company would not have been
able to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ , then Buyer
shall promptly, but in no event later than five Business Days, after the date

of the Buyer Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any contract executed in
connection herewith (excluding the Confidentiality Agreement) or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. In no event shall the Company be
entitled to seek or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of the Buyer
Termination Fee or Breach Termination Fee, as applicable (plus, ( _A_ ) in the
case the Buyer Termination Fee or Breach Termination Fee is not timely paid,
the amounts described in the second and third sentences of _Section 7.3(b)_
 and ( _B_ ) any amounts payable pursuant to the reimbursement or
indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 4.8_ ) against any of the
Buyer Related Parties or any of their respective assets, and in no event shall
the Company 

 



74  be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind against any
Buyer Related Party, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, any breach by the Buyer), the termination of
this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Litigation under applicable Law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , this _Section
7.3(c)_ shall not limit the right of the Company to seek specific performance
of this Agreement by Buyer prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to, and subject to the limitations in, _Section 8.11_ ; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , in no event will the Company be entitled to both (x) the payment
of the Buyer Termination Fee or Breach Termination Fee, as applicable, and (y)
specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.11_. In no
event shall Buyer be required to pay ( _i_ ) both the Buyer Termination Fee
and the Breach Termination Fee or ( _ii_ ) either of the Buyer Termination Fee
or the Breach Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the

transactions contemplated hereby (including, any breach by Buyer),

Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, in the case of the
Company and the Buyer Parties, by action taken or authorized by their

77  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Sections_
_7.3(c)_ , _8.5_ , _8.9_ and this _Section 8.3_ (and any provision of this
Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or termination of
such provision would modify the substance of _Sections_ _7.3(c)_ , _8.5_ ,
_8.9_ and this _Section 8.3_ ) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to the Debt

the modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall
constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in
such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such
waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of
the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more
occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING AS TO
VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, TO THE
EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES ARE NOT MANDATORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND
WOULD PERMIT OR REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation

action or proceeding, shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State
or federal court, and that such jurisdiction of such courts shall be
exclusive, except solely to

 



78  the extent that all such courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction over
a particular matter. Each party hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or in respect of any such transaction, that it is not
subject to such jurisdiction. Each party hereby waives, and agrees not to
assert, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, as a defense in any action,
suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or in respect
of any such transaction, that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each party hereby consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of any such
dispute and agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 8.2_ , or in
such other manner as may be permitted by Law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim or, cross-claim or third-party
claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any
way relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof).

 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR ANY AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED
THEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY PERSON AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING
SOURCE IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE
THEREOF.

 

Section 8.6 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, successors
and permitted assigns; _provided_ that this Agreement shall not be assignable
or otherwise transferable by any party without the prior written consent of
each other party; _provided_ , _further_ that Buyer and MergerCo shall have
the right, without any such consent, to grant a security interest in their
rights and interests under this Agreement as collateral or collaterally assign
this Agreement to any lenders providing the Financing or any other Person
providing financing to the Buyer or its Affiliates, or to any assignee of any
such Person;

 



79  provided that Buyer shall remain liable for all of its obligations under
this Agreement, notwithstanding any such assignment or grant of such security
interest. Any assignment or transfer in violation of the preceding sentence
shall be void.

Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter, Buyer Disclosure Letter, Ancillary
Documents and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Buyer Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and
representations, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

 

Section 8.8 _Severability_. If any provision, including any phrase, sentence,
clause, section or subsection, of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable for any
reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering such
provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case
or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision herein contained invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. Upon any such
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto intend that the
remedies and limitations set forth in this Agreement, including _Section 7.3_
and _Section 8.11_ , shall be construed as an integral provision of this
Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable in
any manner that increases (i) the liability of any party (or the liability of
any Financing Source Party) or any of its stockholders, partners, members,
managers, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives or
agents or (ii) the obligations hereunder.

Section 8.9 _Counterparts_ _; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties. Until and
unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Except as provided under _Section 4.7_ , no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties and their respective successors and assigns. The provisions of
_Sections_ _7.3(c)_ , _8.3_ , _8.5_ and this _Section 8.9_ shall inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Debt Financing Source and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended
to be an express third party beneficiary of _Sections_ _7.3(c)_ , _8.3_ ,
_8.5_ and this _Section 8.9_.

 



80 Section 8.10 _Conflicts; Privilege_. Recognizing that Debevoise and Plimpton LLP
has acted as legal counsel to the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain of the
Stockholders and certain of their respective Affiliates prior to date hereof,
and that Debevoise and Plimpton LLP intends to act as legal counsel to certain
of the direct and indirect holders of the Companys stock and their
respective Affiliates (which will no longer include the Company and the
Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of Buyer, MergerCo and the Company
hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may
arise in connection with Debevoise and Plimpton LLP representing any direct or
indirect Stockholders or their Affiliates after the Closing as such
representation may relate to Buyer, MergerCo, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between
direct and indirect holders the Companys stock, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Debevoise and
Plimpton LLP, on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the direct
and indirect holders of the Companys stock and their respective Affiliates
(and not the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries).
Accordingly, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not have
access to any such communications or to the files of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP
relating to such engagement from and after the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, (
_a_ ) the direct and indirect holders of the Companys stock and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and
the Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to such engagement, and none of the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, ( _b_ ) to the extent that files of
Debevoise and Plimpton LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of
the client, only the direct and indirect holders of the Companys stock and
their respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and ( _c_ ) Debevoise and
Plimpton LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Surviving Corporation or any of
the Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Debevoise and Plimpton LLP and the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or
otherwise. This _Section 8.10_ will be irrevocable, and no term of this
_Section 8.10_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the attorney-client privilege, attorney work
product protection and expectation of client confidence involving general
business matters of the Company (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent relating to the representation of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
certain of the Stockholders and certain of their respective Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) and arising prior to
the Closing are for the sole benefit of Buyer and the Company.

 



81 Section 8.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any court specified in _Section 8.5_ ,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties hereby waive, in any action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and the posting of any bond or other
security in connection therewith.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that
the Company shall be entitled to specific performance against Buyer and
MergerCo ( _i_ ) of Buyers obligations under _Section 4.8_ , including, to
the extent expressly set forth by _Section_ _ _ _4.8_ , Buyers obligation to
cause each Debt Financing Source to fund its respective committed portion of
the Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
to pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date in accordance with the
terms of the Commitment Letter and to enforce its rights under the Commitment
Letter as contemplated by _Section 4.8_ , ( _ii_ ) of Buyers obligations in
respect of the expenses pursuant to _Section 4.8_ , ( _iii_ ) to enforce
Buyers and MergerCos obligations under _Section 4.8_ , and to prevent any
breach by the Buyer of its covenants under this Agreement and ( _iv_ ) if the
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing, to cause Buyer and
MergerCo to consummate the Merger and to effect the Closing in accordance
with _Article 1_.

Section 8.12 _Authorization of Stockholders_ __ _Representative_.

(a) The Stockholders Representative is hereby designated to act, for
the benefit of all Stockholders, as representative and the exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of the Stockholders, in connection with
and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than with respect to the Investor Agreements). The Stockholder Written
Consents shall ratify and approve such designation. The Stockholders
Representative is empowered and authorized:

 

(i) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate
referred to herein, in each case, that requires execution and delivery by a
Stockholder (other than the Investor Agreements), and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the Stockholders
Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;

(ii) as the representative, to enforce and protect the rights and interests
of the Stockholders and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the
Stockholders Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating
to 

 



82  this Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate
referred to herein (other than the Investor Agreements) or the transactions
provided for herein, and to take any and all actions which the Stockholders
Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for
and on behalf of the Stockholders, including asserting or pursuing any claim,
action, proceeding or investigation by or against the Buyer Parties and/or
the Surviving Corporation and, in connection therewith, to ( _A_ ) assert any
claim or institute any action, proceeding or investigation, ( _B_ )
investigate, defend, contest or litigate any claim, action, proceeding or
investigation initiated by any federal, state or local Governmental Authority
against the Stockholders and/or the Stockholders Representative, and receive
process on behalf of the Stockholders in any such claim, action, proceeding
or investigation and compromise or settle on such terms as the Stockholders
Representative shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases
and discharges with respect to, any such claim, action, proceeding
or investigation and ( _C_ ) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as
the Stockholders Representative may deem advisable or necessary;

 

(iii) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Stockholders and/or the
Stockholders Representative arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document in
connection with the foregoing (other than the Investor Agreements); _provided_
, _however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of the Stockholders
Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be
deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Stockholders
Representative or the Stockholders unless such waiver is in writing signed by
the waiving party or by the Stockholders Representative; and

(iv) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Stockholders
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all other agreements, documents
or instruments referred to herein or executed in connection herewith (other
than the Investor Agreements).

(b) The Stockholders Representative will not be required to take any action
involving any expense unless the payment of such expense from the
Representative Fund Amount or otherwise by the Stockholders is made or
provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Stockholders Representative.
The Stockholders Representative shall have the power and authority to use the
Representative Fund Amount and any other funds distributed to the
Stockholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 8.12(b)_ to satisfy

 



83  costs, expenses and/or liabilities of the Stockholders Representative in
connection with matters related to this Agreement. In the event that the
Representative Fund Amount is insufficient to satisfy the Stockholders
Representatives expenses, charges and liabilities, then the Stockholders will
be obligated to pay the excess. If any balance of the Representative Fund
Amount remains undisbursed at such time as all disputes, claims and other
matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all
other instruments and agreements to be delivered pursuant hereto have been
finally resolved, then the Stockholders Representative shall distribute the
remaining balance of the Representative Fund Amount to the Stockholders
according to the aggregate Pro Rata Portions for all shares of Company Stock
held by each Stockholder at the Closing of such balance by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by each Stockholder.

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Stockholders Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing
Date and/or any termination of this Agreement.

(d) The grant of authority provided for herein ( _i_ ) is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the bankruptcy or liquidation of
the Stockholders Representative and ( _ii_ ) shall survive the consummation
of the Merger. Stockholders who own a majority of the Company Shares as of
the date hereof shall be entitled to replace the Stockholders Representative
and to fill any vacancy in the position of Stockholders Representative due
to death, disability or resignation.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in
any other agreement executed in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, following the Closing: ( _i_ ) Buyer, MergerCo and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Stockholders Representative on all matters within the Stockholders
Representatives scope of authority as described in this _Section 8.12_ , and
( _ii_ ) Buyer, MergerCo and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of the Stockholders by
the Stockholders Representative, and on any other action taken or purported
to be taken on behalf of the Stockholders by the Stockholders
Representative, as fully binding upon the Stockholders. A decision, act,
consent or instruction following the Closing of the Stockholders
Representative, in its capacity as such, shall constitute a decision of
the Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Stockholders; and Buyer, MergerCo and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders.
