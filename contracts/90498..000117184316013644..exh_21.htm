AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of December 14, 2016, by and between Simmons First National
Corporation (" _Simmons_ "), an Arkansas corporation, and Southwest Bancorp,
Inc. (" _Southwest_ "), an Oklahoma corporation.

  



  

Preamble

  



  

The board of directors of Southwest has adopted, and the board of directors
of Simmons has approved, this Agreement and declared that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best
interests of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective shareholders.
This Agreement provides for the acquisition of Southwest by Simmons pursuant
to the merger of Southwest with and into Simmons with Simmons as the
surviving corporation. At the effective time of such Merger, the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Southwest shall be converted into the right to
receive a fixed amount of cash and a fixed number of shares of common
stock of Simmons, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. As an
inducement for Simmons to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors of
Southwest have simultaneously herewith entered into a Support and Non-
Solicitation Agreement (each a " _Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the
" _Support Agreements_ ") in connection with the Merger, in the form of
_Exhibit A_ hereto. The transactions described in this Agreement are subject
to the approvals of the shareholders of Southwest and Simmons and applicable
regulatory authorities and the satisfaction of certain other conditions
described in this Agreement. It is the intention of the Parties to this
Agreement that the Merger for federal income tax purposes shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

defined in Section 10.1 of this Agreement.

representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the
Parties agree as follows:

Oklahoma General Corporation Act (the " _OGCA_ ") with the effects set
forth in the ABCA and the OGCA (the " _Merger_ "). Simmons shall be the

assume all the rights and obligations of Southwest in accordance with the
ABCA. Upon consummation of the Merger the separate corporate existence of

trust accounts or otherwise held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or as a

5

 



    

  

(c)  Each share of Southwest Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding the
Canceled Shares and the Southwest Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive the following consideration, in each case without
interest:

  



  

(i)  an amount of cash equal to $5.11 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "); and

each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a "
_Book-Entry Share_ ") registered in the transfer books of Southwest that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Southwest
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Southwest Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with ARTICLE 3, including the right, if any, to
receive pursuant to Section 2.6, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Simmons
Common Stock into which such shares of Southwest Common Stock have been
converted together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section
3.1(d)_.

  



  

(e)  Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement
and subject to Sections 6.2(d) and (e), if at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Southwest should
(i) split, combine or otherwise reclassify the shares of Southwest Common
Stock, (ii) make a dividend or other distribution in shares of Southwest
Common Stock (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Southwest Common Stock), (iii) engage in a reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like change, or (iv)
issue additional shares of Southwest Common Stock or any Equity Right for

any such change.

In the event Simmons changes the number of shares of Simmons Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with respect to such
stock and the record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the
effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar
recapitalization for which a record date is not established) shall be prior

proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect
fully the effect of any such change.

such Southwest Restricted Stock Award in the same manner as all other shares
of Southwest Common Stock for such purposes. Simmons shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from

2.4.  Treatment of Southwest Savings Plan.

converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1(c).

  



  

2.5.  Shares Held by Southwest or Simmons.

  



  

Each Canceled Share shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be issued or delivered in
exchange therefor.

  



  

2.6.  Fractional Shares.

  



  

No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of
Simmons Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Simmons
shall relate to such fractional share interests, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
shareholder of Simmons. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Southwest Common Stock exchanged pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Simmons Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash rounded up to the nearest cent (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Simmons Common Stock that such holder of
shares of Southwest Common Stock would otherwise have been entitled
multiplied by the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration. No such holder will
be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a shareholder
in respect of any fractional shares.

  



  

ARTICLE 3 
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  



  

3.1.  Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a)   _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or promptly
following the Effective Time, Simmons shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with Computershare, Simmons' transfer agent (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), for the benefit of the holders of record of shares of Southwest Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Holders_ "), for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, (i)
certificates or evidence of Simmons Common Stock in book-entry form
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (collectively referred to as " _Simmons
Certificates_ ") for shares of Simmons Common Stock equal to the aggregate
Stock Consideration and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the
aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable,
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6
(collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Simmons shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement. The cash portion of the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Simmons
or the Surviving Corporation. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Simmons and the Surviving
Corporation and shall be paid to Simmons or the Surviving Corporation, as
Simmons directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Simmons, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required
by this ARTICLE 3 and following any losses from any such investment, Simmons
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent
necessary to satisfy Simmons' obligations hereunder for the benefit of the
Holders, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange
Fund.

  



   

7

 



    

  

(b)   _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share notice advising such
holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal
materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and instructions for surrendering
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (such materials
and instructions to include customary provisions with respect to delivery of
an "agent's message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares). Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with the appropriate transmittal materials,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the Holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares which such Holder has a right to receive pursuant
to Section 2.6 and any dividends or distributions which such Holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(d) with respect to the shares of
Southwest Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of Holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The
Stock Consideration delivered to each Holder shall be in non-certificated
book-entry form.

  



  

(c)   _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of Southwest shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Southwest Common Stock. From
and after the Effective Time, Holders who held shares of Southwest Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 3.1, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing
shares of Southwest Common Stock (other than the Canceled Shares) shall from
and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the consideration provided in ARTICLE 2 in exchange therefor,
subject, however, to the Simmons' obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have
been declared or made by Southwest in respect of such shares of
Southwest Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. On or after the Effective Time,
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares (if any) pursuant
to Section 2.6 and any dividends or distributions (if any) pursuant to
Section 3.1(d) with respect to the shares of Southwest Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

  



  

(d)   _Dividends with Respect to Simmons Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Simmons Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the
whole shares of Simmons Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Agreement until the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss and other
documentation required by the Surviving Corporation hereunder in lieu thereof)
there shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of Simmons
Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such whole shares
of Simmons Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Simmons Common Stock.

  



   

8

 



    

  

(e)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect
thereto) which remains undistributed to the former Holders on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Simmons, and any
former Holders who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any applicable dividends
or other distributions with respect to Simmons Common Stock) to which
they are entitled under this ARTICLE 3 shall thereafter look only to Simmons
and the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claims with respect
thereto.

  



  

(f)   _No Liability_. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Regulatory Authority), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Simmons, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto or their successors, assigns,
or personal representatives. None of Simmons, Southwest, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent
or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any Holder in respect of any
cash that would have otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g)   _Withholding Rights_. Each and any of Simmons, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other amounts or
property otherwise payable or distributable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts or property (or portions thereof) as Simmons, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment or distribution under the
Internal Revenue Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Regulatory Authority by
Simmons, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Simmons, the Surviving Corporation, or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable.

  



  

(h)   _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE 3.

  



  

(i)   _Change in Name on Certificate_. If any Simmons
Certificate representing shares of Simmons Common Stock is to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a

shares of Southwest Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 1091 of the OGCA (" _Section 1091_ ") (the "

is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 1091, then the right of such
Holder to be paid the fair value of such Holder's Southwest Dissenting Shares
under Section 1091 shall cease and such Southwest Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section

(b)  Southwest shall give Simmons prompt written notice (but in
any event within 48 hours) to Simmons of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Southwest Common Stock and any withdrawals of such demands, and
Simmons shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations

the prior written consent of Simmons, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
payment.

  



  

(c)  Holders of Simmons Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Simmons Common Stock (the "
_Simmons Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Subchapter 13 of the ABCA (" _Subchapter 13_ ") (the
" _Simmons Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Simmons Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Subchapter 13. At the Effective Time, all Simmons Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Simmons Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the fair value of such Simmons Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Subchapter 13. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Subchapter 13, or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Subchapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Simmons Dissenting Shares under Subchapter 13 shall
cease and such Simmons Dissenting Shares shall revert to shares of Simmons

timely manner accumulate and communicate to Southwest and Southwest Bank's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer the type of
information that would be required to be disclosed in Southwest's and
Southwest Bank's financial statements or any report or filing to be filed or

Southwest nor Southwest Bank nor, to Southwest's Knowledge, any employee,
auditor, accountant or representative of any Southwest Entity has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the adequacy of such systems and
processes or the accuracy or integrity of Southwest Financial Statements, Call
Reports or the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or

(d)   _Records_. The records, systems, controls, data and

photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of Southwest or the Southwest
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that
would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Southwest. Southwest (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, of the Exchange Act) to ensure the
reliability of the Southwest Financial Statements and to ensure that
information relating to Southwest, including Southwest Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or other members
of executive management of Southwest by others within those entities as
appropriate (A) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and
to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), (B)
which allow for maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Assets of

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Southwest are

of Southwest and (D) that provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Southwest's Assets that could have a material adverse effect on its financial

Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect Southwest's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and have
disclosed to its auditors any material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting, and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Southwest's internal control over financial reporting. To the Knowledge of
Southwest, there is no reason to believe that Southwest's outside auditors
and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able
to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due, if required.

constitute such a material Default and all rent and other sums and charges due
and payable under such lease have been paid.

financial statements, actuarial or allocation reports, non-discrimination
tests and valuations prepared for any Southwest Benefit Plan for the
current plan year and the preceding three plan years, (iv) the most recent
summary plan descriptions and any material modifications thereto for any
Southwest Benefit Plan, (v) any correspondence with the DOL, IRS, PBGC, or any
other governmental entity regarding a Southwest Benefit Plan, since December
31, 2009 (vi) any correspondence, memorandum or calculations, since December
31, 2009 regarding errors corrected or to be corrected with respect to any
Southwest Benefit Plan under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution
System and (vii) all actuarial valuations of Southwest Benefit Plans, since
December 31, 2009.

  



  

(b)  Since December 31, 2009, each Southwest Benefit Plan is and
has been maintained in compliance with the terms of such Southwest Benefit
Plan and with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, ERISA,
and any other applicable Laws. No Southwest Benefit Plan is required to be
amended within the ninety-day period beginning on the Closing Date in order to
continue to comply with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and other
applicable Law. Each Southwest Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is so qualified and has
received a favorable determination letter, or for a prototype or volume
submitter plan, opinion letter, from the IRS that is still in effect and
applies to the Southwest Benefit Plan and on which such Southwest Benefit
Plan is entitled to rely. Nothing has occurred and no circumstance exists that
could adversely affect the qualified status of such Southwest Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c)  There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Southwest,
threatened claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the
Southwest Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course
and no action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing or investigation has
been commenced with respect to any Southwest Benefit Plan.

  



   

26

 



    

  

(d)  Neither Southwest nor any Affiliate of Southwest has
engaged in any prohibited transaction for which there is not an
exemption, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of
ERISA, with respect to any Southwest Benefit Plan and no
prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to any Southwest Benefit
Plan that would be reasonably expected to result in any liability or excise
Tax under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code. Neither Southwest, any Southwest
Entity, any Southwest Entity employee, or any committee of which any
Southwest Entity employee is a member has breached his or her fiduciary duty
with respect to a Southwest Benefit Plan in connection with any acts taken
(or failed to be taken) with respect to the administration or investment of
the assets of any Southwest Benefit Plan. To Southwest's Knowledge, no
fiduciary, within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA, who is not Southwest
or any Southwest Entity employee, has breached his or her fiduciary duty with
respect to a Southwest Benefit Plan or otherwise has any liability in
connection with any acts taken (or failed to be taken) with respect to the
administration or investment of the assets of any Southwest Benefit Plan that
would reasonably be expected to result in any liability or excise Tax under
ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code being imposed on Southwest or any Affiliate
of Southwest.

  



  

(e)  Neither Southwest nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any time
been a party to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has been
obligated to contribute to, or had any liability with respect to (i) any plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, including a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
ERISA Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3)), (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within
the meaning of ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code), (iii) any voluntary
employees' beneficiary association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Internal Revenue Code), or (iv) an arrangement that is not either
exempt from, or in compliance with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
or that provides for indemnification for or gross-up of any taxes thereunder.

  



  

(f)  Each Southwest Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare
plan has been amended and administered, in all material respects, in
accordance with the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act of 2010. Each Southwest Benefit Plan which is a self-funded health or
welfare benefit plan (" _Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan_ ") does not have
any covered claims incurred in plan years preceding the current plan year
which are unpaid. Each Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan has stop loss
insurance policies in force for which all premium payments have been made and
are current, and which provides for run-out or tail coverage for covered
claims incurred prior to the end of the plan year or the termination of the
applicable Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan, but not submitted and paid
prior to the end of such period, and such coverage extends for such period
of time as provided under the applicable Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan
to submit claims for the period incurred under the applicable Self-Funded
Health or Welfare Plan (the " _Claims Period_ "). In the event the stop loss
policies currently in place do not provide for run-out or tail coverage to
the end of such Claims Period, the Southwest Entities will obtain such
coverage at the satisfaction of Simmons prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(g)  No Southwest Entity has any Liability or obligation to
provide postretirement health, medical or life insurance benefits to any
Southwest Entity's employees or former employees, officers, or directors, or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise required under
state or federal benefits continuation Laws and for which the covered
individual pays the full cost of coverage. No Tax under Internal Revenue Code
Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any Southwest
Benefit Plan and no circumstance exists which could give rise to such Tax.

  



  

(h)  All contributions required to be made to any Southwest
Benefit Plan by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Southwest Benefit Plan, for any period through
the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of Southwest.

(i)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of any Southwest Entity, or result in any (a) requirement to
fund any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi trust)
or (b) limitation on the right of any Southwest Entity to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Southwest Benefit Plan or
related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by
the Southwest Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Section
4.19(i) of Southwest's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth accurate and complete
data with respect to each individual who has a contractual right to severance
pay or benefits triggered by a change in control and the amounts potentially
payable to each such individual in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) or as a result of a
termination of employment or service, taking into account any contractual
provisions relating to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. No
Southwest Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes
under Section 4999 or 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, or otherwise.

  



  

4.20.  Material Contracts.

  



  

Except as otherwise reflected in the Southwest Financial Statements and the
Southwest SEC Reports, none of the Southwest Entities, nor any of
their respective Assets, businesses, or operations, is a party to, or is
bound or affected by, or receives benefits under, any Contract (whether
written or oral), (a) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined
in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) and that has not been filed

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional acts or events), or (s) any other Contract or
amendment thereto that is material to any Southwest Entity or
their respective business or Assets and not otherwise entered into in the
Ordinary Course. Each Contract of the type described in this Section 4.20,
whether or not set forth in Southwest's Disclosure Memorandum together with
all Contracts referred to in Sections 4.13 and 4.19(a), are referred to
herein as the " _Southwest Contracts_." With respect to each Southwest

in accordance with its terms; (ii) no Southwest Entity is in material Default

any Knowledge of any agreement, plan or other circumstance, that is

Regulatory Approvals.

  



   

31

 



    

  

4.29.  Loan Matters.

  



  

(a)  Neither Southwest nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any written or oral Loan in which Southwest or any Southwest Subsidiary is
a creditor which as of September 30, 2016, had an outstanding balance of
$50,000 or more and under the terms of which the obligor was, as of November
30, 2016, over 90 days or more delinquent in payment of principal or interest.
Except as such disclosure may be limited by any applicable Law, Section
4.29(a) of Southwest's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of all of the Loans of Southwest and its Subsidiaries that,
(A) as of September 30, 2016 had an outstanding balance of $50,000 or more
and were (1) on non-accrual status or (2) classified by Southwest as "Other
Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful,"
"Loss," "Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans,"
"Watch List" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount
of and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the aggregate
principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Loans as of such
date, and (B) at any point since December 31, 2012, constituted a "Troubled
Debt Restructuring," as defined in the Accounting Standards Codification
Subtopic 310-40.

  



  

(b)  Each Loan _currently outstanding_ (i) is evidenced by
notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine
and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by
valid Liens which have been perfected and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship,
moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding may be brought). The notes or other
credit or security documents with respect to each such outstanding Loan were
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws at the time of
origination or purchase by a Southwest Entity and are complete and correct in
all material respects.

  



  

(c)  Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale to
investors) was solicited and originated, and is and has been
administered and, where applicable, serviced, and the relevant Loan files are
being maintained, in all material respects in accordance with the relevant
notes or other credit or security documents, Southwest's written underwriting
standards (and, in the case of Loans held for resale to investors, the
underwriting standards, if any, of the applicable investors) and with all
applicable requirements of Laws.

  



  

(d)  None of the Contracts pursuant to which any Southwest
Entity has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools
of Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein
solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan.
Except as would not be material to Southwest and its Subsidiaries, each Loan
included in a pool of Loans originated, securitized or, to the Knowledge of
Southwest, acquired by Southwest or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Pool_
") meets all eligibility requirements (including all applicable requirements
for obtaining mortgage insurance certificates and Loan guaranty certificates)
for inclusion in such Pool. All such Pools have been finally certified or, if
required, recertified in accordance with all applicable Laws, rules and
regulations, except where the time for certification or recertification has
not yet expired. No Pools have been improperly certified, and, except as
would not be material to Southwest and its Subsidiaries, no Loan has
been bought out of a Pool without all required approvals of the applicable
investors.

(e)  (i) Section 4.29(e) of Southwest's Disclosure Memorandum
sets forth a list of all Loans as of the date hereof by Southwest to any
directors, executive officers and principal shareholders (as such terms are
defined in Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board (12 C.F.R. Part 215)) of
any Southwest Entity, (ii) there are no employee, officer, director, principal
shareholder or other affiliate Loans on which the borrower is paying a rate
other than that reflected in the note or other relevant credit or security
agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate which was not in
compliance with Regulation O and (iii) all such Loans are and were originated
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

suspension, settlement or other contract or other administrative agreement or
sanction by, or any reduction in any loan purchase commitment from, any
Regulatory Agency relating to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage
or consumer Loans.

documentation pertaining to such deposits) have been established and are
held in compliance in all material respects with (a) all applicable policies,
practices and procedures of Southwest Bank and (b) all applicable Laws,
including Money Laundering Laws and anti-terrorism or embargoed persons
requirements. All of the deposits held by Southwest Bank are insured to the
maximum limit set by the FDIC, and the FDIC premium and all assessments have
been fully paid, and no proceedings for the termination or revocation of such
insurance are pending, or, to the Knowledge of Southwest, threatened.

  



  

4.31.  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.

  



  

The allowance for loan and lease losses (" _ALLL_ ") reflected in the
Southwest Financial Statements was, as of the date of each of the Southwest
Financial Statements, in the opinion of management of Southwest, in compliance
with Southwest's existing methodology for determining the adequacy of its
ALLL and in compliance in all material respects with the standards established
by the applicable Regulatory Authority, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board and GAAP, and is adequate.

  



  

4.32.  Insurance.

  



  

Southwest Entities are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and
in such amounts as the management of Southwest reasonably has determined to
be prudent and consistent with industry practice. Section 4.32 of Southwest's
Disclosure Memorandum contains a true, correct and complete list and a brief
description (including the name of the insurer, agent, coverage and the
expiration date) of all insurance policies in force on the date hereof with
respect to the business and Assets of the Southwest Entities, correct and
complete copies of which policies have been provided to Simmons prior to the
date hereof. The Southwest Entities are in material compliance with their
insurance policies and are not in Default under any of the material terms
thereof. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and,
except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers,
directors and employees of the Southwest Entities, Southwest or Southwest
Bank is the sole beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other
payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all material claims
thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion. To
Southwest's Knowledge, no Southwest Entity has received any written notice of
cancellation or non-renewal of any such policies, nor, to
Southwest's Knowledge, is the termination of any such policies threatened.

and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect

this Agreement, and Southwest shall furnish all information concerning
Southwest and the holders of Southwest Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. Each of Simmons and Southwest
agrees to furnish to the other Party all information concerning itself, its

connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Southwest shall have the right to review and consult with

record date for, convene and hold a shareholders' meeting (" _Southwest

outstanding shares of Southwest Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the "

"), (ii) include such Southwest Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and

Shareholders' Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is
originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Southwest Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of such meeting. Southwest shall also adjourn or
postpone Southwest's Shareholders' Meeting, if on the date of Southwest's
Shareholders' Meeting Southwest has not recorded proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Southwest Shareholder
Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Southwest's Shareholders' Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall
be submitted to the shareholders of Southwest at Southwest's Shareholders'
Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the
other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve Southwest of such obligation. Southwest shall only be
required to adjourn or postpone Southwest's Shareholders' Meeting two times
pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 7.1(c).

deems appropriate. Simmons shall (i) through its board of directors, recommend
to its shareholders the approval of this Agreement (the " _Simmons
Recommendation_ "), (ii) include such Simmons Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Simmons
Shareholder Approval.

  



  

7.2.  Acquisition Proposals.

Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage (including by providing information or assistance),
facilitate or induce any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or cause to be furnished to
any Person or "Group" (as such term is defined in Section 13(d) under the
Exchange Act) any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any offer or proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or
recommend, or propose to approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 by any Subsidiary
or Representative of Southwest shall constitute a breach of this Section 7.2
by Southwest.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.2(a),
if Southwest or any of its Representatives receives an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal by any Person or "Group" (as such term is defined
in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) at any time prior to Southwest's
Shareholders' Meeting that did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of Section 7.2(a), Southwest and its Representatives may, prior to (but
not after) Southwest's Shareholders' Meeting, take the following actions if
the board of directors of Southwest (or any committee thereof) has (i)
determined, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with Southwest's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to take such actions would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and (ii) obtained from such Person or "Group" an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive
with respect to such Person or "Group" as the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement is in each provision with respect to Simmons (and such
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such Person or "Group" with any
exclusive right to negotiate with Southwest): (A) furnish information to (but
only if Southwest shall have provided such information to Simmons prior to
furnishing it to any such Person or "Group"), and (B) enter into discussions
and negotiations with, such Person or "Group" with respect to such bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal.

  



   

46

 



    

  

(c)  Promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, Southwest shall advise Simmons in writing of the receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including, in each case, the
identity of the Person or "Group" (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)
under the Exchange Act) making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry), and Southwest shall as promptly as practicable provide to Simmons
(i) a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if in writing, or
(ii) a written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, if oral. Southwest shall provide Simmons as promptly as
practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours) with notice setting forth
all such information as is necessary to keep Simmons informed on a current
basis in all material respects of all communications regarding (including
material amendments or proposed material amendments to) such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any
time prior to Southwest's Shareholders' Meeting, if Southwest has received a
Superior Proposal (after giving effect to the terms of any revised offer by
Simmons pursuant to this Section 7.2(d)), the board of directors of Southwest
may, in connection with the Superior Proposal, make a Change in the Southwest
Recommendation (including, for the avoidance of doubt, approving, endorsing
or recommending any Acquisition Proposal), if the board of directors of
Southwest has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be a violation of the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the board of
directors of Southwest may not take the actions set forth in this Section
7.2(d) unless:

  



  

(i)  Southwest has complied in all material respects with this
Section 7.2;

  



  

(ii)  Southwest has provided prior written notice to Simmons at
least five Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such
action, which notice shall advise Simmons that the board of directors of
Southwest has received a Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of such
Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iii)  during the Notice Period, Southwest has and has caused its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, negotiate with Simmons in
good faith (to the extent Simmons desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the judgment of the board of
directors of Southwest) a Superior Proposal; and

  



   

47

 



    

  

(iv)  the board of directors of Southwest has determined in good
faith, after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect
to any proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed to by Simmons, if
any, that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal.

  



  

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal,
Southwest shall deliver a new written notice to Simmons and shall comply with
the requirements of this Section 7.2 with respect to such new written notice,
including commencement of a new Notice Period.

  



  

Notwithstanding any Change in the Southwest Recommendation, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of Southwest at
Southwest's Shareholders' Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval
of this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Southwest of such obligation; provided, that if the board of directors of
Southwest shall have effected a Change in the Southwest Recommendation, then
the board of directors of Southwest, in connection with the submission of this
Agreement to the shareholders of Southwest may submit this Agreement without
recommendation (although the resolution adopting this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded), in which event the board of directors of
Southwest may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the
shareholders of Southwest in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment
or supplement thereto. In addition to the foregoing, Southwest shall not
submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than
the Merger or enter into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction other than the Merger.

  



  

(e)  Southwest and Southwest Subsidiaries shall, and Southwest
shall direct its Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any offer or proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any Person (other than Simmons and
its Representatives) that has made or indicated an intention to make an
Acquisition Proposal and (iii) not waive or amend any "standstill" provision
or provisions of similar effect to which it is a party or of which it is a
beneficiary and shall strictly enforce any such provisions.

  



  

(f)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
Southwest or its board of directors from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying
with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the shareholders of
Southwest if the board of directors of Southwest (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be
a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Issuance
of any such communication shall be deemed a Change in the Southwest
Recommendation unless the communication includes a reaffirmation of the
Southwest Recommendation in favor of approval by the shareholders of
Southwest of this Agreement.

  



  

7.3.  Exchange Listing.

  



  

Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective
Time, on NASDAQ the shares of Simmons Common Stock to be issued to
the holders of Southwest Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and Simmons
shall give all notices and make all filings with NASDAQ required in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

  



   

48

 



    

  

7.4.  Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

  



  

(a)  Simmons and Southwest and their respective Subsidiaries
shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare
all documentation, to effect all applications, notices and filings and to
obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Regulatory Authorities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and
Regulatory Authorities. Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to the Merger
under any applicable Law or Order; provided, that in no event shall Simmons
be required to accept any new restriction or condition on any of the Simmons
Entities or the Southwest Entities, which is materially burdensome on
Simmons' business or on the business of Southwest or Southwest Bank, in
each case following the Closing or which would likely reduce the economic
benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Simmons to
such a degree that Simmons would not have entered into this Agreement had such
condition or restriction been known to it at the date hereof (any such
condition or restriction, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Each of Simmons and
Southwest shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all
material written information submitted to any third party or Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing review and consultation rights, each of the
Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each
Party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other Party hereto with
respect to the obtaining of all material Permits and Consents of third
parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the
other Party apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including advising the
other Party upon receiving any communication from a Regulatory Authority the
Consent of which is required for the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any required consent or approval
from a Regulatory Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of such
consent or approval may be materially delayed (a " _Regulatory Communication_
"). Upon the receipt of a Regulatory Communication, without limiting the scope
of the foregoing paragraphs, the receiving Party shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law (i) promptly advise the other Party of the receipt
of such Regulatory Communication, (ii) provide the other Party with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of any
response thereto and the preparation of any other substantive submission or
communication to any Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to review any such response, submission or
communication prior to the filing or submission thereof (other than portions
of materials to be filed or submitted in connection therewith that contain
confidential or non-public supervisory information or competitively sensitive
business or proprietary information), and (iii) if permitted by the
applicable Regulatory Authority, provide the other Party with the opportunity
to participate in any meetings or substantive telephone conversations that
the receiving party or its Representatives may have from time to time with any
Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the extent such meetings or telephone conversations do not
contain or involve confidential or non-public supervisory information,
competitively sensitive business or proprietary information.

  



  

(b)  Each Party agrees, upon request, subject to applicable Laws
related to the exchange of information, to promptly furnish the other Party
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any Regulatory
Authority.

  



   

49

 



    

  

7.5.  Investigation and Confidentiality.

  



  

(a)  Southwest shall promptly notify Simmons of any material
change in the normal course of its business or in the operation of its
properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, of any material
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of a material claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
involving Southwest or Southwest Bank.

  



  

(b)  Southwest shall promptly advise Simmons of any fact,
change, event or circumstance known to Southwest (i) that has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Southwest or (ii) which
Southwest believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE 8;
provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 7.5(b) or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2
to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach
would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 to be satisfied.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, Southwest shall permit
Simmons to make or cause to be made such investigation of the business and
properties of it and its Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and
legal conditions as Simmons reasonably requests, provided that such
investigation shall not interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. No
investigation by Simmons shall affect the ability of Simmons to rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Southwest. Neither
Simmons nor Southwest nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Simmons' or
Southwest's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest,
joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties) or contravene any Law,
fiduciary duty or binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

  



  

(d)  Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents
to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to
it by the other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses,
operations, and financial positions and shall not use such information for
any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each
Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and
copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information
received from the other Party.

  



  

7.6.  Press Releases.

  



  

Southwest and Simmons agree that no press release or other public disclosure
or communication (including communications to employees, agents and
contractors of Southwest) related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by either Party (or its
Affiliates) without the prior written consent of the other Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed to
prohibit any Party from making any press release or other public disclosure
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or non-United
States securities exchange, in which case the Party required to make the
release or disclosure shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other
Party reasonable time to comment on such release or disclosure in advance of
the issuance thereof. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press
release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

  



   

50

 



    

  

7.7.  Tax Treatment.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action
which would cause the Merger not, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax
purposes. The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
in order to obtain the Tax Opinions. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

  



  

(b)  Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of
Simmons and Southwest shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take any
inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.

  



  

7.8.  Employee Benefits and Contracts.

  



  

(a)  Following the Effective Time, except as contemplated by
this Agreement, Simmons shall provide generally to officers and employees (as
a group) who are actively employed by a Southwest Entity on the Closing Date
(" _Covered Employees_ ") while employed by Simmons following the Closing
Date employee benefits under Employee Benefit Plans offered to similarly
situated employees of Simmons, including severance benefits in accordance
with the applicable severance policy of Simmons (other than to any Covered
Employee who is party to individual agreements or letters that entitle such
person to different severance or termination benefits); provided, that in no
event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or
frozen plan of any Simmons Entity. Until such time as Simmons shall cause the
Covered Employees to participate in the applicable Simmons Employee Benefit
Plans, the continued participation of the Covered Employees in the Southwest
Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this
clause (it being understood that participation in Simmons' Employee Benefit
Plans may commence at different times with respect to each of Simmons'
Employee Benefit Plans). For purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting under Simmons' Employee Benefit Plans, and for
purposes of determining a Covered Employee's entitlement to paid time off
under Simmons' paid time off program, the service of the Covered Employees
with a Southwest Entity prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
service with a Simmons Entity participating in such employee benefit plans, to
the same extent that such service was recognized by the Southwest Entities
for purposes of a similar benefit plan; provided, that such recognition of
service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee
with respect to the same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any
plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of
Simmons Entities do not receive credit for prior service, (y) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation, or (z) for purposes of retiree medical benefits or level of
benefits under a defined benefit pension plan.

  



  

(b)  If requested by Simmons in a writing delivered to Southwest
following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, the Southwest
Entities shall take all necessary action (including without limitation the
adoption of resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of any required
notices) to terminate, effective as of no later than the day before the
Closing Date, any Southwest Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a
tax-qualified defined contribution plan under Internal Revenue Code Section

the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to
effectuate the termination of the 401(k) Plans in advance and give Simmons a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be
considered in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date, Southwest

(c)  Upon request by Simmons in writing prior to the Closing
Date, the Southwest Entities shall cooperate in good faith with Simmons prior
to the Closing Date to amend, freeze, terminate or modify any other Southwest
Benefit Plan to the extent and in the manner determined by Simmons effective
upon the Closing Date (or at such different time mutually agreed to by the
parties) and consistent with applicable Law. Southwest shall provide Simmons
with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents

Closing Date, Southwest shall provide Simmons with the final documentation
evidencing that the actions contemplated herein have been effectuated.

  



  

(d)  The provisions of this Section 7.8 are solely for the
benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no Covered Employee, current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event
shall the terms of this Agreement: (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Southwest Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Simmons, Southwest or any of their
respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Simmons or any
Simmons Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Southwest
Entities) to amend, modify or terminate any Southwest Benefit Plan,
employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with Simmons or any
Simmons Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the
Southwest Entities), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee, or interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Surviving Corporation, Southwest, Simmons or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Southwest or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

  



  

7.9.  Indemnification.

  



  

(a)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Simmons shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and
former directors or officers of the Southwest Entities (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all Liabilities arising out of actions or
omissions arising out of the Indemnified Party's service or services as
directors or officers of Southwest or, at Southwest's request, of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted under state Law and by
Southwest's certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the
defense of any Litigation and whether or not any Simmons Entity is insured
against any such matter. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which
approval by Simmons is required to effectuate any indemnification, Simmons
shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination
of any such approval shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed
upon between Simmons and the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(b)  Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts (and
Southwest shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to
maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time
Southwest's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
(provided that Simmons may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
substantially no less advantageous or (ii) with the consent of
Southwest given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect
to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective
Time and covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance;
provided, that Simmons shall not be obligated to make aggregate premium
payments for such six-year period in respect of such policy (or coverage
replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion related to Southwest's
directors and officers, 200% of the annual premium payments currently paid on
Southwest's current policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Simmons shall use
its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal
to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Simmons, or Southwest in
consultation with Simmons, may obtain on or prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year "tail" prepaid policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in this Section 7.9(b) at a premium not to exceed the Maximum
Amount. If the premium necessary to purchase such "tail" prepaid policy
exceeds the Maximum Amount, Simmons may purchase the most advantageous "tail"
prepaid policy obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount, and in
each case, Simmons shall have no further obligations under this Section
7.9(b) other than to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy.

  



   

52

 



    

  

(c)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under Section 7.9(a), upon learning of any such Liability or
Litigation, shall promptly notify Simmons thereof. In the event of any such
Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) Simmons
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Simmons shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Simmons elects not to
assume such defense or independent legal counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Simmons and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Simmons shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; provided, that Simmons shall be obligated
pursuant to this Section 7.9(c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such Litigation; and (iii) Simmons shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent; and provided, further,
that Simmons shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

  



  

(d)  If Simmons or any successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or if Simmons (or any
successors or assigns) shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets
to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Simmons shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 7.9.

  



  

(e)  The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and Representatives.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.9 to the
contrary, no indemnification payments will be made to an Indemnified Party
with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any
federal banking agency unless all of the following conditions are met: (i)
the Simmons' board of directors determines in writing that the Indemnified
Party acted in good faith and in the best interests of the Southwest or
Southwest Bank; (ii) the Simmons' board of directors determines that the
payment will not materially affect the Simmons' safety and soundness; (iii)
the payment does not fall within the definition of a prohibited
indemnification payment under 12 C.F.R. Part 359; and (iv) the Indemnified
Party agrees in writing to reimburse the Simmons, to the extent not covered
by permissible insurance, for payments made in the event that the
administrative or civil action instituted by a banking Regulatory Authority
results in a final order or settlement in which the Indemnified Party is
assessed a civil money penalty, is prohibited from banking, or is required to
cease an action or perform an affirmative action.

  



   

53

 



    

  

7.10.  Operating Functions.

  



  

Southwest and Southwest Bank shall cooperate with Simmons and Simmons Bank in
connection with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of
the Parties and the operation of Simmons Bank and Southwest Bank, and in
preparing for the consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be
effective at the Effective Time or such later date as Simmons may decide.
Southwest shall take any action Simmons may reasonably request prior to the
Effective Time to facilitate the combination of the operations of Southwest
with Simmons. Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such
service providers and/or the other party). Without limiting the foregoing,
Southwest shall provide office space and support services (and other
reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection with the foregoing,
and senior officers of Southwest and Simmons shall meet from time to time as
Southwest or Simmons may reasonably request to review the financial and
operational affairs of Southwest and Southwest Bank, and Southwest shall give
due consideration to Simmons' input on such matters, with the
understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, (a) neither Simmons nor Simmons Bank shall under any circumstance
be permitted to exercise control of Southwest, Southwest Bank or any other
Southwest Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (b) neither Southwest nor
any Southwest Bank shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that could
reasonably be deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or
state antitrust Laws, and (c) neither Southwest nor Southwest Bank shall be
required to agree to any material obligation that is not contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger.

  



  

7.11.  Shareholder Litigation.

  



  

Each of Simmons and Southwest shall promptly notify each other in writing of
any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,
suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by
or before, or otherwise involving, any Regulatory Authority or arbitrator
pending or, to the Knowledge of Simmons or Southwest, as applicable,
threatened against Simmons, Southwest or any of their respective Subsidiaries
that (a) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of
this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Simmons, Southwest or their
respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to
enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Southwest shall give Simmons every opportunity to participate in the defense
or settlement of any shareholder litigation against Southwest and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Simmons' prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

7.12.  Legal Conditions to Merger.

  



  

Subject to Sections 7.1 and 7.4 of this Agreement, each of Simmons and
Southwest shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable
best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper
or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any Consent or Order by, any
Regulatory Authority and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by Southwest or Simmons or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with, or to effect, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
(including, any merger between a Subsidiary of Simmons, on the one hand, and a
Subsidiary of Southwest, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the Parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall
take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Simmons.

  



   

54

 



    

  

7.13.  Dividends.

  



  

After the date of this Agreement, each of Simmons and Southwest shall
coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Simmons Common Stock and Southwest Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Southwest Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of Southwest Common Stock and any shares of Simmons Common Stock
any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

  



  

7.14.  Change of Method.

  



  

Simmons may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger (including
by providing for the merger of Southwest with a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Simmons) if and to the extent requested by Simmons, and Southwest agrees to
enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Simmons may reasonably
request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, that no such
change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the
Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to Southwest's shareholders or (iii)
be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the
receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially
delayed.

  



  

7.15.  Takeover Statutes.

  



  

Neither Simmons nor Southwest shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Simmons and
Southwest shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from
any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover
Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Simmons and Southwest will grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

  



  

7.16.  Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b).

  



  

Southwest and Simmons agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain those officers and directors of Southwest subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Southwest
Insiders_ "), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable
that Southwest Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
in connection with the conversion of shares of Southwest Common Stock in the
Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the
provisions of this Section 7.16. The boards of directors of Simmons and of
Southwest, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of Southwest
Common Stock and (ii) any acquisitions of Simmons Common Stock pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by any Southwest Insiders
who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the
Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

Effective Time and Southwest's consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
and shareholders' equity for the period from January 1, 2016 through the
close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Closing Financial Statements_ "); provided, that if
the Effective Time occurs on or before the 15th Business Day of the month,
Southwest shall have provided consolidated financial statements as of and
through the second month preceding the Effective Time. Concurrently with the
delivery of the Closing Financial Statements, Southwest shall provide Simmons
with a schedule (the " _Transaction Fee Schedule_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail the fees and expenses incurred and paid as well as accrued
and unpaid by the Southwest Entities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Such financial statements shall have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulatory accounting principles and
other applicable legal and accounting requirements, and reflect all period-
end accruals and other adjustments. Such Closing Financial Statements shall
exclude as of their date fees and expenses and accruals for all fees and
expenses incurred or expected to be incurred (whether or not doing so is in
accordance with GAAP) in connection (directly or indirectly) with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Closing Financial Statements
shall include (a) the capital ratios set forth in Section 8.2(g) (but
excluding from the calculation of such ratios the amounts set forth on the
Transaction Fee Schedule) and (b) the asset quality metrics set forth in
Section 8.2(e), and shall be accompanied by a certificate of Southwest's
chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that
(i) such financial statements meet the requirements of this Section 7.17 and
continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of such certificate, the
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and
shareholders' equity of Southwest in all material respects and (ii) the
Transaction Fee Schedule accurately reflects, as of the same date, all
fees and expenses incurred or accrued by the Southwest Entities in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

7.18.  Subordinated Debentures.

  



  

Upon the Effective Time, Simmons or one of its Subsidiaries shall assume the
due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants and
conditions to be performed by Southwest or its Subsidiaries under the (i)
Indenture between Southwest and U.S. Bank, N.A., dated as of June 26, 2003,
relating to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.10% floating rate subordinated
debentures of Southwest due 2033 (the " _Southwest Subordinated Debentures_
") and (ii) Indenture between Southwest and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., dated as
of October 14, 2003, relating to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.85% floating
rate subordinated debentures of Southwest due 2033 (the " _Southwest II
Subordinated Debentures_ ," collectively with the Southwest Subordinated
Debentures, the " _Subordinated Debentures_ "), and the due and punctual
payments of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the
Subordinated Debentures. In connection therewith, Simmons or its applicable
Subsidiary shall execute and deliver any supplemental indentures, and the
parties hereto shall provide any opinion of counsel to the trustee thereof,
required to make such assumptions effective. If requested by Simmons,
Southwest will, or cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with
Simmons to facilitate the prompt redemption of the Subordinated Debentures at
or following the Closing.

The representations and warranties set forth in each other section in ARTICLE
4 shall, in the aggregate, be true and correct in all respects except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and

(f)  By Southwest in the event that any of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of Southwest to consummate the Merger contained
in Section 8.3 cannot be satisfied or fulfilled by the date specified in
Section 9.1(c) (provided that the failure of such condition to be satisfied

the date specified in Section 9.1(c) so as not to contain or result in a
Burdensome Condition;

the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Simmons shall
have the option to, in its sole and absolute discretion, maintain the
Exchange Ratio and elect to increase the Cash Consideration by an amount in
cash so that, as a result of such adjustment, the Merger Consideration, based
on the Average Closing Price, shall be no less than the Minimum
Merger Consideration. If Simmons so elects within such five-day period, it
shall give prompt written notice to Southwest of such election and the
revised Cash Consideration, whereupon no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this Section 9.1(j) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms (except as the Cash Consideration shall have been so
modified).

Section 9.1, this Agreement shall become void and have no further force or
effect and there shall be no Liability on the part of any Party hereto for any
matters addressed herein or other claim relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) the provisions of this
Section 9.2, Section 7.5(d), and ARTICLE 10, shall survive any such
termination and abandonment and (ii) no such termination shall relieve the
breaching Party from Liability resulting from any fraud or intentional breach
by that Party of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination or
abandonment. In addition, in the event of the termination and abandonment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii) or Section 9.1(d) and, within

"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed followed by the
words "without limitation." The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any specific Section. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the
masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the context may
require. If a word or phrase is defined, the other grammatical forms of
such word or phrase have a corresponding meaning. Any capitalized terms used
in any schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall have the
meaning set forth in this Agreement. All references to "dollars" or "$" in
this Agreement are to United States dollars. All references to "the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement" (or similar phrases) include the
transactions provided for in this Agreement, including the Merger. Any
Contract or Law defined or referred to herein or in any Contract that is
referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts) by waiver or
consent and (in the case of Law) by succession of comparable successor Law
and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. The term "made available" means any document or other information
that was (a) provided (whether by physical or electronic delivery) by one
Party or its representatives to the other Party and its representatives at
least two Business Days prior to the date hereof, (b) included in the virtual

"80%" in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be a
reference to "50%") or (2) enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect

in this Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed
as a further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of

10.10.  Counterparts; Signatures.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise
the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data
file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment or waiver
hereto or any agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was

The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that money

of this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled, without the requirement of posting bond, to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties waives any
defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

  



   

78

 



    

  

10.14.  Severability.

  



  

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
