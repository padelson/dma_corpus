</FONT><U>Systems and Processes</U>. Each of Southwest and Southwest Bank have in place sufficient systems and processes that are
customary for a financial institution of the size of Southwest and Southwest Bank and that are designed to (i) provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of Southwest&rsquo;s and Southwest Bank&rsquo;s Financial Statements and (ii) in a timely
manner accumulate and communicate to Southwest and Southwest Bank&rsquo;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer
the type of information that would be required to be disclosed in Southwest&rsquo;s and Southwest Bank&rsquo;s financial statements
or any report or filing to be filed or provided to any Regulatory Authority. Since December 31, 2012, neither Southwest nor Southwest
Bank nor, to Southwest&rsquo;s Knowledge, any employee, auditor, accountant or representative of any Southwest Entity has received
or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
adequacy of such systems and processes or the accuracy or integrity of Southwest Financial Statements, Call Reports or the accounting
or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs
and accruals) of Southwest or any Southwest Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Southwest or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.
No attorney representing Southwest or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Southwest or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Southwest or
any of its officers, directors or employees to the board of directors of Southwest or any committee thereof or to any director
or officer of Southwest. To Southwest&rsquo;s Knowledge, there has been no instance of fraud by any Southwest Entity, whether or
not material, that occurred during any period covered by Southwest Financial Statements.</P>

</FONT><U>Records</U>. The records, systems, controls, data and information of Southwest and the Southwest Entities are recorded,
stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized
or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Southwest or the Southwest Subsidiaries or accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Southwest. Southwest (i) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, of the Exchange Act) to ensure
the reliability of the Southwest Financial Statements and to ensure that information relating to Southwest, including Southwest
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or other members of executive management of
Southwest by others within those entities as appropriate (A) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make
the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &ldquo;<U>Sarbanes-Oxley
Act</U>&rdquo;), (B) which allow for maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the Assets of Southwest, (C) that provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Southwest are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Southwest and (D) that provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Southwest&rsquo;s Assets that could
have a material adverse effect on its financial statements and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Southwest&rsquo;s outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of Southwest (x) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 13d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect Southwest&rsquo;s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, and have disclosed to its auditors any material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting, and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Southwest&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. To the Knowledge of Southwest, there is no reason to believe
that Southwest&rsquo;s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due, if required.</P>

in accordance with the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Each Southwest Benefit Plan which
is a self-funded health or welfare benefit plan (&ldquo;<U>Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan</U>&rdquo;) does not have any covered
claims incurred in plan years preceding the current plan year which are unpaid. Each Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan has stop
loss insurance policies in force for which all premium payments have been made and are current, and which provides for run-out
or tail coverage for covered claims incurred prior to the end of the plan year or the termination of the applicable Self-Funded
Health or Welfare Plan, but not submitted and paid prior to the end of such period, and such coverage extends for such period of
time as provided under the applicable Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan to submit claims for the period incurred under the applicable
Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan (the &ldquo;<U>Claims Period</U>&rdquo;). In the event the stop loss policies currently in place
do not provide for run-out or tail coverage to the end of such Claims Period, the Southwest Entities will obtain such coverage
at the satisfaction of Simmons prior to the Closing Date.</P>
