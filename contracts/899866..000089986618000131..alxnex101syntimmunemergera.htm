Closing Indebtedness"), and (d) its estimate of the Closing Cash (such

along with reasonable supporting detail to evidence the calculations of such

Section 3.3 Adjustment Amount.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter, Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Stockholders' Representative (i) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of 5:00 PM
(Eastern time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), together with a statement setting forth Buyer's
calculation of the Net Closing Working Capital Adjustment as derived from the
Closing Balance Sheet, (ii) a statement setting forth Buyer's calculation of
the Transaction Expenses, (iii) a statement setting forth Buyer's calculation

27

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





setting forth Buyer's calculation of the Closing Cash, in each case, as set
forth on a statement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders'
Representative, along with reasonable supporting detail to evidence the
calculations of such amounts. The Closing Balance Sheet and Buyer's
calculations of the Net Closing Working Capital Adjustment, the Transaction
Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Cash shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and using the same accounting principles, practices,
policies and methodologies used in the preparation of the Company Financial
Statements.

(b) After the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Net Closing Working
Capital Adjustment, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness and the
Closing Cash in accordance with Section 3.3(a), at the Stockholders'
Representative's request, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries, including their respective Representatives, to reasonably
cooperate with the Stockholders' Representative and its Representatives in
their review of the Closing Balance Sheet and Buyer's calculations of the Net
Closing Working Capital Adjustment, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Cash and shall provide to the Stockholders'
Representative and its Representatives information that they may reasonably
request and access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties,
working papers, books and records of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries for such purpose.

(c) Unless the Stockholders' Representative notifies Buyer in writing within
sixty (60) days after Buyer's delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Net
Closing Working Capital Adjustment, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Cash in accordance with Section 3.3(a), and the
supporting detail with respect thereto, of any objection to the computations
set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet or Buyer's calculations of the Net
Closing Working Capital Adjustment, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing
Indebtedness or the Closing Cash (the "Notice of Objection"), the Closing
Balance Sheet and Buyer's calculations of the Net Closing Working Capital
Adjustment, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing
Cash shall be final and binding for all purposes hereunder. Any Notice of
Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the objections set
forth therein and shall include the Stockholders' Representative's calculation
of any amounts that are disputed by such Notice of Objection (the "Disputed
Amounts") to the extent that such amounts may be determined (it being
understood that an objection to one or more of the foregoing amounts shall not
prevent any other amount from becoming final and binding for all purposes
hereunder).

(d) If the Stockholders' Representative provides such Notice of Objection to
Buyer within such 60-day period, Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative
shall, during the 60-day period following the Stockholders' Representative's
delivery of such Notice of Objection to Buyer, attempt in good faith to
resolve any Disputed Amounts. If Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative
are unable to resolve all such Disputed Amounts within such period, the
matters remaining in dispute shall be submitted to a nationally recognized
public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Stockholders'
Representative (such accounting firm being referred to herein as the
"Independent Accountant"). The parties shall instruct the Independent
Accountant to render its decision as promptly as possible, but no later than
sixty (60) days after its selection. The Independent Accountant will consider
only those items and



28

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





amounts in the Stockholders' Representative's and Buyer's respective
calculations of the Net Closing Working Capital Adjustment, the Transaction
Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Cash that are identified as
being items and amounts to which the Stockholders' Representative and Buyer
have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by the Stockholders' Representative or Buyer or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either of them. The Surviving
Company and the Stockholders' Representative shall each furnish to the
Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and information
relating to the Disputed Amounts as the Independent Accountant may reasonably
request. The resolution of the Disputed Amounts by the Independent Accountant
shall be final and binding, and the determination of the Independent
Accountant shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover. After final determination of the Net Closing Working
Capital Adjustment, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness and the
Closing Cash, the Stockholders' Representative shall have no further right to
make any claims in respect of any element of the foregoing amounts that the
Stockholders' Representative raised in the Notice of Objection.

(e) The date on which the Net Closing Working Capital Adjustment, the
Transaction Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Cash are
finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.3 is hereinafter referred
as to the "Determination Date." Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative (on
behalf of the Securityholders) shall each pay their own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the resolution of the Disputed Amounts; provided,
that the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated
between Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative in the same proportion that
the total amount of the Disputed Amounts submitted to the Independent
Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the total amount of the
Disputed Amounts so submitted by each such party (e.g., should the items in
dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600
in favor of Buyer's position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
the Stockholders' Representative and 40% of the costs would be borne by
Buyer).

(f) "Adjustment Amount" (positive or negative) means the Final Aggregate
Closing Merger Consideration minus the Estimated Aggregate Closing Merger
Consideration. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (an "Adjustment
Surplus Amount"), within ten (10) Business Days following the Determination
Date, Buyer shall deliver by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i)
to the Paying Agent, an amount equal to the applicable portion of the
Adjustment Surplus Amount payable to the Stockholders, and (ii) to the
Surviving Company, the applicable portion of the Adjustment Surplus Amount
payable to the holders of Cancelled Options. Upon receipt by the Paying Agent
of the applicable portion of the Adjustment Surplus Amount payable to the
Stockholders, Buyer shall direct the Paying Agent to promptly disburse the
amounts so received by it, subject to the procedures set forth in Section 3.4
and Section 3.5(a). Upon receipt by the Surviving Company of the applicable
portion of the Adjustment Surplus Amount payable to the holders of Cancelled
Options, the Surviving Company shall promptly disburse the amounts so received
by it, subject to the procedures set forth in Section 3.4



29

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





and Section 3.5(b). If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (an
"Adjustment Deficit Amount"), within three (3) Business Days following the
Determination Date, the absolute value of such Adjustment Deficit Amount shall
be distributed, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, by the Escrow
Agent from the Escrow Fund to an account designated in writing by Buyer. In
the event that there is an Adjustment Deficit Amount in excess of [*] Buyer
shall be entitled to deposit a portion of the Earn‑Out Payments (if any) equal
to such Adjustment Deficit Amount in the Escrow Account, which Escrow Account
shall be subject to release in accordance with Section 3.7.

Section 3.4 Disbursements by Paying Agent and the Surviving Company. In the
event that an Adjustment Surplus Amount exists, an Earn-Out Payment is to be
made or an Escrow Fund Release Amount exists, Buyer shall pay such amounts to
the Paying Agent (with respect to amounts to be paid to the Stockholders and
recipients of Transaction Expenses) and the Surviving Company (with respect to
amounts to be paid to the holders of Cancelled Options) for distribution to
the Stockholders and holders of Cancelled Options in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 3.5(a) and Section 3.5(b), respectively.

Section 3.5 Exchange Procedures.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall mail
or cause to be mailed, or otherwise make available, to each holder of
certificates (the "Certificates") formerly evidencing Shares a form of the
Letter of Transmittal. After the Effective Time, each holder of Certificates,
promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the
surrender of such Certificates (or affidavit of lost certificate(s)) to the
Paying Agent, together with the duly completed and validly executed Letter of
Transmittal, shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, in exchange
therefor and subject to any additional terms and conditions of the Paying
Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, and otherwise by
check, the applicable portion of the consideration that such former holder of
Shares has the right to receive from time to time pursuant to this Article
III, and any Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if requested by the Company, Buyer shall reasonably cooperate
in distributing the Letters of Transmittal prior to the Closing so that they
can be collected and delivered to the Paying Agent on or prior to the Closing
as coordinated by the Company's counsel.

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each
holder of any Cancelled Options an executed Joinder Agreement with respect to
such Cancelled Options prior to the Closing; provided, however, that the
Company shall be under no obligation to offer any payment to the holders of
any Cancelled Options that do not provide an executed Joinder Agreement with
respect to such Cancelled Options. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, but in any event not later than seven (7) Business Days after the
date hereof, the Company shall send a written notice in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer to each Option Holder that shall inform such Option Holder
of the treatment of the Options and Ungranted Options provided in Section
3.1(b) and providing instructions for the delivery of a Joinder Agreement in
exchange for the consideration as specified and allocated in Section 3.1(b).

After the Effective Time, each holder of Cancelled Options, subject to signing
a Joinder Agreement, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the
applicable portion of the consideration that the holder of such Cancelled
Options has the right to receive from time to time pursuant to this Article
III. In each case, the consideration payable to such former holder of
Cancelled Options shall be made by the Surviving Company in accordance with
its payroll practices on the Surviving Company's next regularly scheduled pay
day following the tenth (10th) Business Day after such holder becomes entitled
to receive such consideration under this Section 3.5(b).

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Shares that is not
registered in the transfer books of the Company, subject to any applicable
withholding Taxes, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Certificate shall be lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and an undertaking of
indemnity by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Surviving Company will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) At any time following the expiration of [*] after the Effective Time, the
Buyer shall, in its reasonable discretion, be entitled to require the Paying
Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and such funds shall thereafter
become the property of the Buyer. Such funds may be commingled with the
general funds of the Buyer and shall be free and clear of any claims or
interests of any Person. Thereafter, such holders of Certificates shall be
entitled to look to the Buyer (subject to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable consideration payable as contemplated by this Agreement (without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) upon due surrender
of their Certificates. Any portion of such remaining cash unclaimed by
Stockholders as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(e) At the Closing, the transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfer in the transfer books of
the Surviving Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 3.5.

Section 3.6 Payments at Closing. At the Closing, Buyer will make (or cause to
be made) the following payments:

(a) to the Paying Agent, an amount equal to the Aggregate Liquidation
Preference Amount payable to the holders of Preferred Stock;



31

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





(b) to the Paying Agent, an amount equal to the applicable portion of the
Estimated Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders;

(c) to the Surviving Company, the applicable portion of the Estimated
Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Cancelled
Options;

(d) to the Escrow Agent, an amount equal to the Escrow Amount;

(e) to the Stockholders' Representative, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Stockholders'
Representative in writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, an amount equal to the Stockholders' Representative Expense
Amount; provided, that the Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount shall
be deemed for Tax purposes to have been paid to the Stockholders and Option
Holders at the Closing in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares; and,
provided further, to the extent that any withholding is required in connection
with such deemed payment, then to ensure that the Stockholder or Option Holder
to which the withholding applies has contributed its Pro Rata Share to the
Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount (after taking into account any
such withholding), such Stockholder or Option Holder shall be deemed to have
received an amount equal to its Grossed-Up Expense Amount Contribution to fund
the Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount and, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, any other amount unrelated to the
Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount that otherwise would have been
payable to the applicable Stockholder or Option Holder at Closing shall be
reduced by the amount of any such payment deemed received by the Stockholder
or Option Holder in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the Stockholders'
Representative Expense Amount;

(f) on behalf of the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account or accounts designated by the Company in the statement of
Transaction Expenses delivered pursuant to Section 3.2, an amount in the
aggregate equal to the Transaction Expenses, which amounts shall be
distributed in accordance with the statement of Transaction Expenses delivered
pursuant to Section 3.2; and

(g) on behalf of the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account or accounts designated by the Payoff Letters obtained pursuant
to Section 6.10 in respect of the Closing Indebtedness or as otherwise
designated by the Company in writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, an amount in the aggregate equal to the Closing
Indebtedness, as set forth in the statement of Closing Indebtedness delivered
pursuant to Section 3.2.

Section 3.7 Escrow Amount.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit with Wilmington Trust Corporation (the
"Escrow Agent"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the Escrow Amount, such amount plus all accumulated earnings thereon
(such amounts, if any, "Escrow Consideration") to constitute an escrow fund
(the "Escrow Fund") to be governed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the escrow agreement in substantially the form



32

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





attached hereto as Exhibit G (the "Escrow Agreement"), among Buyer, the Escrow
Agent and the Stockholders' Representative.

(b) The Escrow Fund shall be used to satisfy any amounts owed to Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement, including the payment of the Adjustment Amount, if
any, pursuant to Section 3.3(f) and any indemnification amounts owed
hereunder. Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative shall timely provide any
joint written instructions contemplated by Section 3.3 or Article VIII so that
distributions can be made by the Escrow Agent within the time period required
by Section 3.3(f) or Article VIII.

(c) The First Escrow Fund Release Amount shall be released pursuant to joint
written instructions to be provided to the Escrow Agent by Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative on the date that is one (1) Business Day after
the First Escrow Release Date. The "First Escrow Fund Release Amount" shall be
equal to [*]. Any remaining portion of the Escrow Fund that is not used to
satisfy any other amounts owing to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, including
indemnification amounts, or not subject to any claims hereunder, shall be
released pursuant to joint written instructions to be provided to the Escrow
Agent by Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative on the date that is one
(1) Business Day after the Second Escrow Release Date (the "Second Escrow Fund
Release Amount") as provided in this Section 3.7(c); provided, that if there
are any indemnification claims hereunder that are properly pending on the
Second Escrow Release Date, such portion of the Escrow Fund corresponding to
the amounts subject to such claims shall not be released until the applicable
claims are finally resolved and satisfied. The First Escrow Fund Release
Amount and the Second Escrow Fund Release Amount are each referred to herein
from time to time as an "Escrow Fund Release Amount." Upon any release of the
Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall release (i) to the Paying Agent, an amount
equal to the applicable portion of the Escrow Fund Release Amount payable to
the Stockholders and (ii) to the Surviving Company, the applicable portion of
the Escrow Fund Release Amount payable to the Option Holders. Upon the final
release of all of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agreement shall terminate. All
funds so released from the Escrow Fund shall include any Escrow Consideration
and shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent (with respect
to the applicable portion of the Escrow Fund Release Amount payable to the
Stockholders) or the Surviving Company (with respect to the applicable portion
of the Escrow Fund Release Amount payable to the holders of Cancelled
Options).

(d) The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to
any Lien, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(e) The Parties agree that for Tax purposes: (i) it is intended that, if and
to the extent any portion of the Escrow Fund is actually distributed to Option
Holders in respect of their Cancelled Options or any Earn-Out Payment is
actually paid to Option Holders in respect of their Cancelled Options, such
portion shall be treated as compensation paid at the time the portion of the
Escrow Fund is actually released to the Option Holders or the amount of such
Earn-Out Payment is actually paid to the Option Holders and, in each case,
shall be subject to applicable withholding Tax at such time; (ii) it is
intended that the right of the holders of Common Stock



33

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





and Preferred Stock to the Escrow Fund and Earn-Out Payments be treated as
deferred contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale treatment
under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of foreign,
state or local law, as appropriate (provided, however, Buyer is making no
representation or covenant as to whether such Tax treatment shall be respected
by any Governmental Entity); (iii) it is intended that Buyer shall be treated
as the owner of the Escrow Fund, and all interest and earnings earned from the
investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, shall
be allocable to Buyer and Buyer shall receive quarterly distributions from the
Escrow Fund equal to 25% of the amount of the income earned by the Escrow Fund
for such quarter in order for Buyer to pay its taxes on such income; and (iv)
if and to the extent any amount of the Escrow Fund is actually distributed to
the holders of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, interest may be imputed on
such amount as required by applicable Law. All Parties shall file all Tax
Returns consistently with the foregoing intended Tax treatment, unless
otherwise required by a change in applicable Law following the Closing Date.

Section 3.8 Earn-Out Payments; Diligence.

(a) From and after the Closing, upon the first achievement by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including Buyer), licensees or sublicensees of the following
events (each a "Milestone Event") with respect to the Product, as further
consideration for the Merger, Buyer shall make (or cause to be made) to the
Securityholders in accordance with Section 3.4, the following payments (each,
an "Earn-Out Payment"), in each case in accordance with Section 3.8(c) below
after the achievement of each Milestone Event described below as conditions
precedent for each such payment:

(i) a one-time payment of [*] upon the earlier of (A) [*] or (B) [*];

(ii) a one-time payment of [*] upon t[*] for any first Indication;

(iii) a one-time payment of [*] upon [*] for a second Indication.

(iv) a one-time payment of [*] upon receipt of Regulatory Approval from the
FDA for any first Indication;

(v) a one-time payment of [*] upon receipt of Regulatory Approval from the FDA
for a second Indication;

(vi) a one-time payment of [*] upon receipt of Regulatory Approval from the
EMA for any first Indication;

(vii) a one-time payment of [*] upon receipt of Regulatory Approval from the
EMA for a second Indication; and

(viii) a one-time payment of [*] (the "Sales Earn-Out Payment") upon the
determination at the end of Buyer's fiscal year that the Net Sales for such



34

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





fiscal year across all Indications equals or exceeds [*] (the "Sales Earn-Out
Goal").

(b) For clarity, the maximum aggregate amount of Earn-Out Payments payable
under this Agreement is Eight Hundred Million Dollars ($800,000,000). The
portion of each of the Earn-Out Payments in subclauses (i) through (viii) of
Section 3.8(a) that may become payable to Option Holders shall be deemed a
separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.

(c) The Milestone Events for Regulatory Approval in the EMA set forth in
Section 3.8(a)(vi) and Section 3.8(a)(vii) shall be achieved upon receipt of
the applicable reimbursement and/or pricing approval from the applicable
Governmental Entity in three (3) out of the following five (5) countries:
United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany or Spain.

(d) If any given Earn-Out Payment is due and one or more previous Earn-Out
Payments would reasonably have been anticipated to precede such Earn-Out
Payment for the achievement of Milestone Events have not been paid for any
reason, then payment of all such preceding unpaid Earn-Out Payments will be
due at such time as well. For example, if Earn-Out Payment (ii) were to become
due, and Milestone Event (i) has not yet been achieved and accordingly Earn-
Out Payment (i) had not been paid, then Earn-Out Payment (i) will become due
at the time Earn-Out Payment (ii) becomes due.

(e) With respect to the achievement of any Milestone Event, Buyer shall
provide written notice to the Stockholders' Representative of such occurrence
no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after Buyer becomes aware of the
occurrence thereof. Thereafter, Buyer shall make (or cause to be made) the
corresponding Earn-Out Payment to Securityholders in accordance with Section
3.4 within forty-five (45) days after the occurrence thereof. The Buyer shall
pay interest on any Earn-Out Payment that is not paid on or before the date
such payments are due under this this Agreement at an annual rate equal to [*]
plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made, calculated on the total number of
days payment is delinquent.

(f) For a period of [*] following the Closing Date, Buyer shall and shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Company) to use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to achieve (or cause its Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees with
respect to rights to develop or commercialize the Product to achieve) each of
the Milestone Events; provided however, [*]. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that Buyer does not currently intend to pursue the Indication set
forth on Exhibit J (the "Excluded Indication"), and that a decision to not
pursue the Excluded Indication will not be a violation of Buyer's obligation
to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Without limiting the foregoing,
neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall take any action, or omit to take any
action, the primary purpose of which is to avoid the achievement of any
Milestone Event.

(g) The Company understands and acknowledges that Buyer and its Affiliates may
have present or future initiatives or opportunities, including initiatives or
opportunities with its Affiliates or third parties, involving products,
programs, technologies or processes that are similar to, and in some instances
may compete with products, programs, technologies or



35

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





processes covered by this Agreement. The Company acknowledges and agrees that
nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation, warranty or
covenant that Buyer, or any of its Affiliates will not itself develop,
manufacture or commercialize or enter into business relationships with one (1)
or more of its Affiliates or any third parties to develop, manufacture or
commercialize, products, programs, technologies or processes that are similar
to or that may compete with any product, program, technology or process
covered by a Milestone Event.

(h) Following the Closing until all Earn-Out Payments have been made (or Buyer
and Stockholders' Representative otherwise mutually agree), Buyer shall
provide Stockholders' Representative, within ninety (90) days following
January 1st of each calendar year, with an annual written report of the
efforts of Buyer and any of its Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees to
achieve the Milestone Events and their progress with respect thereto, which
report shall generally describe the status of the development of the Product.

(i) Buyer shall keep, and shall cause its Affiliates and sublicensees to keep,
adequate books and records of accounting for the purpose of confirming whether
any Milestone Event has occurred for a period of five (5) years following the
end of the calendar year to which such books and records pertain.

(j) Commencing the calendar year following the year in which the first
commercial sale of the Product occurs until payment of the Sales Earn-Out
Payment (or Buyer and Stockholders' Representative otherwise mutually agree),
on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day following release by Buyer of its
(or its applicable Affiliate's) audited financial statements for each fiscal
year during such period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders'
Representative (i) a statement setting forth Buyer's determination of Net
Sales with respect to the Sales Earn-Out Goal for such fiscal year. In order
to allow the Stockholders' Representative to verify the proposed determination
with respect to the Sales Earn-Out Goal, Buyer shall provide copies of any
records or other documentation reasonably requested by the Stockholders'
Representative that were used by Buyer in reaching such determination and
shall afford Stockholders' Representative or its designees reasonable access
during normal business hours to appropriate Buyer (or its Affiliate) personnel
to discuss such records or documentation. If the Stockholders' Representative
has any objections to Buyer's determination, then the Stockholders'
Representative may object by delivering a written objection notice and the
Parties shall proceed to resolve such disagreement in accordance with the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 3.3(c), applied mutatis
mutandis. If it is determined through such dispute resolution procedures that
the Sales Earn-Out Goal was achieved, Buyer shall make (or cause to be made)
the Sales Earn-Out Payment to Securityholders in accordance with Section 3.4,
subject to the late payment interest set forth in Section 3.8(c).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subsequent to the
Closing, Buyer shall have sole discretion with regard to all matters relating
to the operation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses and shall have no obligation, or liability as a result of the
failure, to achieve any of the events described in Section 3.8(a) that would
give rise to an Earn-Out Payment.

(k) Subject to Section 3.8(l), Buyer shall remain responsible for paying any
and all Earn-Out Payments in accordance with this Section 3.8 upon the
achievement of the



36

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





corresponding Milestone Event, whether achieved by Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or any of their licensees or sublicensees with respect to rights to
develop or commercialize the Product.

(l) Unless and until a Carve-Out Transaction occurs, Buyer shall remain
responsible for paying any and all Earn-Out Payments in accordance with this
Section 3.8 upon the achievement of the corresponding Milestone Event, whether
achieved by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of their licensees or
sublicensees with respect to rights to develop or commercialize the Product.
Without limiting the foregoing, so long as any of the Earn-Out Payments remain
outstanding, in the event that Buyer or, after a Change of Control or Carve-
Out Transaction, any of its respective successors, assignees or transferees
undergoes a subsequent Change of Control or Carve-Out Transaction, then, and
in each such case, Buyer shall either (i) ensure that (x) each such successor,
assignee or transferee of Buyer or such assets or Product agrees to assume all
obligations of Buyer, including payment of all Earn-Out Payments, set forth in
this Agreement, and (y) has the capabilities, financial and otherwise to do
so, or (ii) Buyer shall agree to remain subject to its obligations hereunder,
including payment of all Earn-Out Payments. In the event of (i) an assignment
by Buyer of this Agreement or (ii) a Carve-Out Transaction, in each case (i)
and (ii), to any Controlled Affiliate of Buyer, but only for so long as it
remains a Controlled Affiliate of Buyer after which the obligations of the
foregoing sentence shall apply, Buyer shall agree to remain liable for the
performance by each such assignee of all obligations, including payment of all
Earn-Out Payments, of Buyer hereunder.

Section 3.9 Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount. At the Closing, Buyer
shall deposit cash in an amount equal to the Stockholders' Representative
Expense Amount into an account designated by the Stockholders' Representative
in accordance with Section 3.6(e). The Stockholders' Representative Expense
Amount shall be used to fund any expenses incurred by the Stockholders'
Representative in the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder. The
Securityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Stockholders'
Representative Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Stockholders' Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholders' Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Stockholders' Representative
Expense Amount other than as a result of its Actual Fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Stockholders' Representative will hold these funds
separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these
funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Stockholders'
Representative Expense Amount will be held by the Stockholders' Representative
until such time as the Stockholders' Representative determines, in its sole
discretion, that the Stockholders' Representative does not expect to incur any
additional expenses in connection with performing its obligations in such
capacity under this Agreement. Any portion of the Stockholders' Representative
Expense Amount remaining after such date shall be paid by the Stockholders'
Representative to the Paying Agent and the Surviving Company (as applicable)
for further distribution to the Stockholders and the Option Holders in
proportion to their Pro Rata Shares.

Section 3.10 Tax Documentation. The Surviving Company, the Paying Agent and
Buyer shall be entitled to request and collect any Tax forms legally able to
be given, including



37

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





IRS Form W-9, or the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any
similar information reasonably necessary, from any Stockholder, Option Holder
or any other recipient of any payment pursuant to, or in connection with, this
Agreement, and such Stockholder, Option Holder or other recipient hereby
covenants to provide such Tax form or information it is legally able to
deliver upon reasonable request by the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or
Buyer, as the case may be.

Section 3.11 Withholding. The Surviving Company, the Paying Agent and Buyer
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable
pursuant to, or in connection with, this Agreement to any Stockholder, Option
Holder or other Person, as the case may be, such amounts as the Surviving
Company, the Paying Agent or Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax
Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company, the
Paying Agent or Buyer, and remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity,
such withheld and remitted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Stockholder, Option Holder or other
Person, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or Buyer, as the case may
be.

Section 3.12 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
held by Stockholders who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 3.1.
Such Stockholders shall be entitled to receive such consideration as is
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares
held by holders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262
of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and extinguished
and converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
consideration specified in Section 3.1 (as adjusted, if applicable), without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.5,
of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting
Shares.

(b) The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company and withdrawals of such demands, and (ii)
the opportunity to direct and/or consult with the Company with respect to all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor Buyer shall, except
with the prior written consent of the other party, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle, or settle or otherwise
negotiate any such demands.

Section 4.14 Intellectual Property.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns all Company Owned
Intellectual Property, or, to the knowledge of the Company, has validly
licensed, or has the right to use, in the manner currently used by the
Company, all Company Intellectual Property free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens). The foregoing is not, and shall not be construed as, a
representation or warranty regarding non-infringement, misappropriation or
other violation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Intellectual
Property of other Persons.

(b) Section 4.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a correct, current,
and complete list of all domestic and foreign Patents, Patent Applications,
registered Trademarks and registered Copyrights and applications and
registrations thereof, domain names and any other registrations of or
applications to register Intellectual Property owned by or registered in the
name of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("Company Registered IP").

(c) All the Company Registered IP, as registered, filed, issued or applied
for, have been registered in, filed in or (except with respect to
applications) issued by, the official governmental registrars and/or issuers
(or officially recognized issuers) of such items of Intellectual Property, in
the various jurisdictions (national, state, provincial, prefectural, local and
other) indicated on Section 4.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, and except as

reissue, interference, opposition or cancellation proceeding (nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, have any been threatened). The Company or one or
more of its Subsidiaries have the exclusive right to file, prosecute and
maintain all Patent Applications and registrations with respect to the Company
Registered IP as owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each item of
the Company Registered IP is subsisting, and each item of the Company
Registered IP other than any application is, to the knowledge of the Company,
valid and enforceable. None of the Company Owned Intellectual Property has
ever been found invalid or unenforceable in any administrative, arbitration,
judicial or other proceeding. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notice claiming or asserting that any Company Owned
Intellectual Property may be invalid or unenforceable.

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the Company's and each of
its Subsidiaries' business as formerly conducted has not infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated, and as currently conducted does not and
would not, if the Product (as it exists as of the date of this Agreement) were
sold as of the date of this Agreement, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise
violate the valid Intellectual Property of any Person. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, (a) the Company's and its Subsidiaries' "business" shall
be limited to the research and development of the Product for the treatment of
the Indications set forth in Section 4.14(d) of the Disclosure Schedule and
for no other Indication or use and (b) any "sale" of the Product shall be
limited to a sale of the Product for the treatment of the Indications set
forth in Section 4.14(d) of the Disclosure Schedule and for no other
Indication or use. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company Owned
Intellectual Property is being infringed upon by any third party. There are no
Legal Proceedings settled, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened (including in the form of offers to obtain a license) (i) alleging
any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation by the Company of the
Intellectual Property of any Person; (ii) challenging the validity,
enforceability, registrability, patentability, or ownership of any Company
Owned Intellectual Property (other than rejections, objections or other
similar challenges in any office actions made in the ordinary course of
prosecution of Company Registered IP); or (iii) by the Company or any other
Person alleging any infringement, misappropriation or violation by any Person
of the Company Owned Intellectual Property. The Company is not subject to any
outstanding or prospective order, decree or ruling issued by a court or other
Governmental Entity that does or could reasonably be expected to restrict or
impair the use of any Company Owned Intellectual Property.

(e) All Intellectual Property that was created by employees or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the scope of their employment is
owned by the Company or its applicable Subsidiary, either by operation of law
or pursuant to a written assignment agreement. All current and former
consultants of the Company or its Subsidiaries who have, in connection with
their performance of consultancy services for the Company or its Subsidiaries,
conceived of or reduced to practice any patentable invention that is related
to the development, manufacture, use or sale of the Product (as it exists as
of the date of this Agreement), has assigned ownership of any of their
interest in such invention to the Company or its applicable Subsidiary
pursuant to a written agreement, subject to applicable institutional policies
with respect to individuals employed by academic or research institutions.
With respect to Company Owned Intellectual Property, other than as set forth
in Section 4.14(e) of the

Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company, no employee, officer,
consultant or other Person (other than clinical sites or other Persons
providing services with respect to or participating in the conduct of a
clinical trial in accordance with the applicable protocol) has used any
facilities or received any remuneration from any academic or research
institution or Governmental Entity in connection with such Person's services
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable steps to maintain the Company Registered IP and to protect the
secrecy and confidentiality of trade secrets (as such term is defined in the
Uniform Trade Secrets Act, "Trade Secrets") owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no material Trade Secret owned
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been divulged by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or authorized by the Company or its Subsidiaries to be
divulged to any Person other than (i) to the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries or any person to whom the Company or its Subsidiaries has granted
the right to use such information under a non-disclosure agreement,
confidentiality agreement or other agreement that imposes a confidentiality
obligation on the recipient, or (ii) to support any new Patent Application.

(g) The computer hardware, servers, networks, platforms, peripherals, data
communication lines, and other information technology equipment and related
systems that are owned or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
("Company Systems") are reasonably sufficient for the current needs of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective businesses. To the knowledge of the
Company, there has been no unauthorized access, use, intrusion, or breach of
security, or failure, breakdown, performance reduction, or other adverse event
affecting any Company Systems, that has caused or could reasonably be expected
to cause any material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries. The
Company has taken reasonable actions, consistent with reasonable practices of
clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies of similar size and scope, to
protect the integrity and security of the Company Systems and the data and
other information stored or processed thereon. The Company maintains
commercially reasonable backup procedures and processes.

(h) In reviewing the representations and warranties in this Section 4.14 and
assisting in preparation of Section 4.14 to the Disclosure Schedule, Jean-Paul

outside intellectual property counsel.

Subsidiary of the Company as is reasonably necessary in connection with the

reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith agreements or arrangements that
permit the provision of such information to Buyer without having any such

shall prepare and mail a written disclosure statement (the "Disclosure
Statement"), in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, to each of the
Stockholders in accordance with Section 228(e) of the DGCL. Buyer and Merger
Sub shall provide the Company with such information regarding any of them and
any of their Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by the Company to be
included in the Disclosure Statement.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto (other than the Stockholders' Representative) will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
(including making any requisite filings or giving any requisite notices) under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as expeditiously as practicable and to ensure that the
conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied, insofar as such matters are
within the control of any of them, including, without limitation, using
reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing, all consents of third
parties as are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that, in connection with obtaining such third party
consents, no Contract shall be amended to increase the amount payable by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder or otherwise to be more
burdensome in any material respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
unless, in each case, mutually agreed in writing by the Company and Buyer.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 6.2,
the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
shall each furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing.

(b) Each Party (other than the Stockholders' Representative) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities that may be or become
necessary or advisable for its execution and delivery of, and the performance
of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) cooperate fully with the other Party in
promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals, and (iii) provide all such other information to any Governmental
Entity as such Governmental Entity may request in connection herewith. Each
Party (other than the Stockholders' Representative) agrees to file promptly
(but in no event later than five Business Days after the date of this
Agreement) any premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act and
related material required to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an early termination of the
applicable waiting period. Each Party (other than the Stockholders'
Representative) shall supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Entities any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested by them pursuant to the HSR Act. Each Party (other than the
Stockholders' Representative) agrees to make as promptly as practicable its
respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other merger
notification or control Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, and to
supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by them
pursuant to such merger notification or control Law. Except as required by
applicable Law, neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Buyer or Merger Sub,
on the other hand, may, without the consent of the other party or parties
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), as applicable, (1) cause
any such filing or submission applicable to it to be withdrawn or refiled for
any reason, including to provide the applicable Governmental Entity with
additional time to review any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (2) consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline
or waiting period or to any

voluntary delay of the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity. Buyer
shall pay 100% of any amounts due with respect to all fees and all other
payments required to be paid to any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any
such authorizations, consents, orders or approvals, and 50% of the amount of
such fees and payments shall be deemed Transaction Expenses for purposes of
this Agreement, so that each of Buyer and the Securityholders bears 50% of
such fees and payments in the event of the Closing.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party (other than
the Stockholders' Representative) shall use reasonable best efforts to take
any and all steps necessary or advisable to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any antitrust or competition Governmental Entity or any other
party so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any
event prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates be
required to agree to divest, abandon, license, hold separate or take similar
action with respect to any assets of the Company, any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer.

(d) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall promptly notify the other of any communication it or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives receives from any Governmental Entity
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the
other to review reasonably in advance any proposed communication by it to any
Governmental Entity relating to such matters. Except as required by applicable
Law, neither Buyer nor Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the
other hand, shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of
the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the matters that
are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Buyer and Merger Sub,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall reasonably
coordinate and cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting
periods, including under the HSR Act. Buyer and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, will provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that such materials may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements as of
the date hereof, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client
or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, to the extent that that such
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns are not
governed by a common interest privilege or doctrine.

the Company and the Buyer will not, and will cause each of their Affiliates
and Representatives not to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided, however, that a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
parties hereto, issue or cause the publication of any such press release or
other public announcement to the extent that such party reasonably determines,
after consultation with legal counsel, that such action is required by
applicable Law or by the rules of any applicable self-regulatory organization
or any stock exchange on which any stock of Buyer (or Affiliate thereof) is
listed or traded, in which event (unless prohibited by applicable Laws) such
party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other parties
hereto reasonable time to comment on such press release or other public
announcement in advance of its issuance or publication, and provided, further,
however, that following the Closing the Buyer will not need any consent with
respect to a press release or other public announcement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Securityholder, and no broker or financial advisor to a
Securityholder or the Company, will issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of
Buyer in its sole discretion, except that, each of Apple Tree Partners IV,
L.P. and Partners Innovation Fund LLC may, with the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, issue one
press release which (i) contains substantially the same information with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement included in the
Joint Release, and (ii) is issued no sooner than the later of (x) eight hours
after the issuance of the Joint Release, or (y) 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on
the date of the Joint Release.

Section 6.6 Section 280G. With respect to each employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company who is, or would reasonably be expected to be as of
the Closing Date, a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c)
of the Code), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) (A)
ensure that any payments that would otherwise constitute a "parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) shall be exempt from the
definition of "parachute payment" by reason of the exemption provided under
Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, and (B) take all actions reasonably
necessary to so exempt such payments (including obtaining any necessary
waivers or consents from such "disqualified individuals") prior to the Closing
Date; or (ii) not make any payments that would constitute a "parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code). At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the delivery to the Stockholders of documents in
connection with the stockholder approval contemplated under subsection (i)
above, the Company will provide Buyer and its

counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all documents
to be delivered to the Stockholders and disqualified individuals in connection
with the waivers and vote.

Section 6.7 Expenses. Each Party shall bear its own fees, costs and expenses
incurred in the pursuit of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the fees and expenses of its respective counsel, financial advisors
and accountants, except as otherwise expressly contemplated herein. All fees,
costs and expenses of the Paying Agent incurred in connection with the
performance of its duties in respect of this Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement and all fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent incurred in the
performance of its duties in respect of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement shall be paid by Buyer.

Section 6.8 Tax Matters.

(a) Transfer Taxes. Transfer Taxes arising from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne by the Securityholders. "Transfer Taxes"
means all sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains, transfer,
stamp, registration, documentary, recording or similar Taxes, in each case,
arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, together with
any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees or additions to Tax. If
Buyer or the Surviving Company is required to file any Tax Return related to
Transfer Taxes, Buyer or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall file
such Tax Return and pay any Transfer Taxes and the applicable Securityholders
shall reimburse the paying party for its share of Transfer Taxes within ten
(10) days of written request.

(b) Tax Returns.

(i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are required to
be filed prior to or on the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be complete
and correct in all material respects and shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices of the Company and that does not distort
taxable income; provided that no such Tax Returns that are income Tax Returns
or material Tax Returns shall be filed with any Governmental Entity without
providing such Tax Return to Buyer for its review and written approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Company and each of its the Subsidiaries shall timely pay all Taxes due and
payable in respect of such Tax Returns by each such entity, except for Taxes
that are being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings and for
which appropriate reserves have been established on the books of the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be. The Company shall promptly
notify Buyer of written or, to the knowledge of the Company, unwritten notice
of any Tax Proceeding pending against or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and will not settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding
without Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.



71

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





(ii) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are filed
after the Closing Date. If any such Tax Returns relates to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Period (as defined below), Buyer shall prepare, or caused
to be prepared, such Tax Return consistent with the past practices of the
Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. If any such Tax Returns relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
a Straddle Period, Buyer shall provide the Stockholders' Representative with a
draft of such Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns for the
Stockholders' Representative review and approval, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in the preparation of any
Tax Return described in this Section 6.8(b)(ii) relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period to the extent that such Tax Return is being filed in the ordinary
course after the Closing and does not relate to any breach of a covenant or
representation for which Buyer already would be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement shall also be treated as an indemnifiable Loss pursuant
to Section 8.1(c). For the avoidance of doubt, any preparation costs for any
Tax Return for a Straddle Period being filed in the ordinary course after the
Closing shall be borne by Buyer.

(c) Straddle Periods. All Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating
to any Tax period that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date
(such Tax period, a "Straddle Period") shall be apportioned to, and be the
responsibility of, the Securityholders as follows: (i) real, personal and
intangible property taxes ("Property Taxes") for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date shall be equal to the amount
of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that are in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) for
the portion of the Straddle Period shall be computed as if such taxable period
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date, provided that
exemptions, allowances, deductions that are calculated on an annual or other
periodic basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending as of the close of
business on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period. For purposes of
allocating income or loss to a Tax period (or portion thereof, if a Straddle
Period) ending on or before the Closing Date, in the case of any Taxes
attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any partnership or
other "flowthrough" entity, the "flowthrough" income or loss attributable to
an equity interest in such "flowthrough" entity shall be determined as if a
taxable period of such partnership or other "flowthrough" entity ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

(d) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all Tax sharing, Tax allocation, Tax
indemnity or similar agreements, arrangements, or practices (including any
advance pricing agreement, closing agreement or other similar written
agreement relating to Taxes with any



72

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





Governmental Entity, but excluding customary commercial contracts the primary
purpose of which is unrelated to Taxes) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise subject shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and after the Closing Date none of the Surviving Company, Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer shall be bound thereby, have any liability
thereunder, or be obligated to make any payment thereunder.

(e) Covered Securities. On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Buyer, or at Buyer's request, the Paying Agent or Escrow Agent, the
information described under Treasury Regulations Section 1.6045A-1 with
respect to the Company securities being acquired pursuant to the Agreement,
including (i) whether or not a particular security is a "covered security"
under the applicable Treasury Regulations and (ii) if a security is a "covered
security", each security holder's date of acquisition of, and cost basis in,
the applicable security, and any other information that is required, or
reasonably requested, by Buyer or its designee to comply with Buyer or its
designee's tax reporting obligations under the Code and Treasury Regulations,
including IRS Form 1099-B reporting requirements.

(f) Tax Cooperation. Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Company, the
Stockholders, the Option Holders and the Stockholders' Representative, as the
case may be, shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other
representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable
periods relating to Taxes, including by maintaining and making available to
each other all records reasonably necessary in connection with Taxes and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to
testify at proceedings relating to such matters.

(g) Additional Pre-Closing Tax Covenants. On or prior to the Closing Date,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, make, revoke or change any material Tax election,
adopt or change any material Tax accounting method or period, file any amended
Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement or settlement relating to Taxes,
settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes, or consent to any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations
period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment.

(h) Post-Closing Tax Actions. Buyer and its Affiliates shall not (i) amend any
previously filed Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) file Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in
a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has not
historically filed Tax Returns, (iii) initiate discussions or examinations
with any Governmental Entity regarding Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, or (iv) make any voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, in each case, without the prior written consent of
the Stockholders' Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In addition, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall make any election under Sections 338 or 336(e) of the Code or any state,
local or foreign law equivalent in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(i) Tax Refunds. Any refunds (or credits for overpayment) of Taxes, including
any interest received from a Governmental Entity thereon, attributable to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be for
the account of the Securityholders to the extent such Taxes were paid by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Closing or
actually reduced the Merger Consideration payable to the Securityholders under
this Agreement or were paid by the Securityholders after the Closing pursuant
to the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. Promptly upon any receipt
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any such refund (or credit for
overpayment), Buyer shall pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount equal to any such refund received (or the amount of any such
credit), including any interest received thereon, to the Paying Agent (for
further distribution to the Securityholders) pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, with each such Securityholder being entitled to receive its Pro
Rata Share of such amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Tax refunds (or
credits for overpayment) payable to the Securityholders that are in the nature
of compensation (including, for example, amounts paid to holders of Cancelled
Options in respect of their Options or Ungranted Options) shall be processed
through the payroll system of the Company, the Surviving Company or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as applicable, and paid directly to such
recipient (less any applicable withholding Taxes). Any amounts payable to the
Securityholders pursuant to this Section 6.8(i) shall be reduced by the
reasonable incremental third-party costs incurred by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in connection with obtaining such refund or credit.

(j) Transaction Tax Deductions.

(i) With respect to the preparation of income Tax Returns of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries agree that all
Transaction Tax Deductions will be treated as properly allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date to the extent permitted by
applicable Tax Law. In connection with the foregoing, the Parties agree that
seventy percent (70%) of any success-based fees may be deducted for U.S.
federal income tax purposes pursuant to the safe harbor election in Revenue
Procedure 2011-29, unless such Revenue Procedure is revoked or otherwise
supplanted by any change in applicable Law. The Parties intend that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall cause the income Tax year of
the Company to end as of the Closing Date for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
(and, consistent with this, Buyer shall include the Company in its affiliated
group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return beginning on the
date after the Closing Date).

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Transaction Tax Deductions" means (A)
all Tax deductible fees, expenses and interest (including amounts treated as
interest for income Tax purposes and any breakage fees or accelerated deferred
financing fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to the payment of Closing Indebtedness in connection with the Closing,
(B) all Tax deductible fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are Transaction Expenses under clause (i) of that
definition, and (C) all Tax deductible compensatory payments made with respect
to the Closing pursuant to Section 3.6, and, without



74

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





duplication, any Tax deductible amounts that are Transaction Expenses under
clauses (ii) and (iii) of that definition and that are paid with respect to
the Closing, in the case of each of (A) through (C), to the extent such fees,
costs or expenses result in a reduction in the Merger consideration received
by the Securityholders or constitute amounts for which Buyer is entitled to,
and able to obtain, indemnification under Article VIII.

Section 6.9 No Solicitations. From the date hereof until the earlier to occur
of (a) the termination of this Agreement or (b) the Closing (such earlier
date, the "End Date"), the Company will not, and will instruct its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates and any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) discuss,
negotiate, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, either as
the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired entity, any transaction
involving a merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, business
combination, purchase or disposition of any material amount of the assets of
the Company (other than the sale of assets in the ordinary course of business)
or any of its Subsidiaries or any voting securities or other ownership
interests in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such other transaction, an
"Acquisition Transaction"), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate
discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of
an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any
Person or entity, any information concerning the business, operations,
properties or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Transaction, or (iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by
any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. From the date hereof
until the End Date, the Company shall, and shall instruct its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other
than Buyer and Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction. The Company agrees not to (and to cause its
Subsidiaries not to) release any third party from the confidentiality
provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party prior to the End Date. Furthermore, prior to the End Date, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt
thereof by the Company or, to the Company's knowledge, its Representatives)
advise Buyer orally and in writing of any Acquisition Transaction proposal,
any request for information with respect to any Acquisition Transaction, or
any inquiry with respect to a proposal for an Acquisition Transaction, the
material terms and conditions of such request or inquiry and the identity of
the Person making the same. The Company agrees that the rights and remedies
for noncompliance with this Section 6.9 shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause
irreparable injury to Buyer and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Buyer.

Section 6.10 Payoff Letters. Except as set forth in Section 6.10 of the
Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall obtain, no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, payoff letters (the "Payoff Letters") in
customary form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer from the holders (or the
agents for such holders) of the Closing Indebtedness, if any, and all
documents related thereto, including any credit agreements, pledge agreements,
security agreements, notes and guarantees, and all Liens securing the Closing
Indebtedness shall be



75

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





released or terminated upon the repayment of the Closing Indebtedness in
accordance with the terms of such Payoff Letters. Each Payoff Letter shall set
forth the principal amount of the obligation, any prepayment premiums or fees
or termination fees with respect thereto, any accrued interest thereon and any
expense reimbursement or other amounts due in respect thereof, shall provide
wire instructions and shall provide for the release of, or authorize the
Company to release, all Liens associated with such Closing Indebtedness and
the termination of all other obligations associated therewith upon the payment
of such outstanding amounts.

Section 6.11 Confidential Information.

(a) Except as required by Law, each Party shall keep confidential and not
directly or indirectly reveal, report, publish, disclose or transfer any
information regarding any other Party or the negotiations preceding this
Agreement other than to its Representatives, and each will use such
information solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated for
any reason, the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall return to the Party that provided such information, without
retaining any copies thereof, any schedules, documents or other written
information obtained from such Party in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall cause all of its Representatives to
whom it may have disclosed such information to do the same.

(b) Following the Closing, the Stockholders' Representative shall keep
confidential and not directly or indirectly reveal, report, publish, disclose
or transfer any information concerning the business and affairs of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that is not generally available to the public,
including know-how, trade secrets, customer lists, details of customer or
consultant contracts, pricing policies, financial performance, operational
methods and marketing plans or strategies (collectively, "Confidential
Information"), and will not use such information for the Stockholders'
Representative's own benefit or for the benefit of any other Person (other
than the Securityholders) and shall direct any of the Representatives of the
Stockholders' Representative to whom Confidential Information is disclosed to
do the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, no Party shall be
required to keep confidential any information that (i) is known or available
through other lawful sources not bound by a confidentiality agreement or other
binding legal obligation, (ii) is or becomes publicly known or generally known
in the industry through no fault of the receiving Party or its agents, (iii)
is requested or required to be disclosed pursuant to Law, provided the other
Parties are given reasonable prior notice thereof to the extent legally
permissible, or (iv) relates solely to the Tax aspects and consequences of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) If the Stockholders' Representative is requested or required (by oral
question or request for information or documents in any Legal Proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, the Stockholders' Representative shall
notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement (unless prohibited by
applicable Law) so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.11. If, in the absence
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Stockholders'
Representative is, on



76

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to
any Governmental Entity, the Stockholders' Representative may disclose the
Confidential Information to the Governmental Entity; provided, however, that
the Stockholders' Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, at the request of and expense of Buyer, an order or other assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the
Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, following Closing, the Stockholders' Representative shall be
permitted to: (i) after the public announcement of the Merger, publicly
announce that it has been engaged to serve as the Stockholders' Representative
in connection herewith as long as such announcement does not disclose any of
the other terms hereof; and (ii) disclose information on a need-to-know basis
(A) in connection with legal proceedings to enforce or defend the rights of
the Securityholders in connection herewith, (B) to employees, advisors, agents
or consultants of the Stockholders' Representative and (C) to the
Securityholders, in each case in the foregoing clauses (B) and (C) provided
that such recipients are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect
thereto.

Section 6.12 Capital Structure Certificate

(a) At least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer the Capital Structure Certificate, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and the Paying Agent, dated and setting forth the
following information with respect to each Stockholder and holder of Cancelled
Options (each, a "Securityholder"): (i) the name and the mailing address of
such Securityholder; (ii) with respect to each Certificate held by such
Securityholder, the certificate number of such Certificate, and the number and
class or series of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate (and, with respect to each
Option and Ungranted Option held by such Securityholder, the number of shares
of Common Stock underlying such Option or Ungranted Option, as applicable, and
the per share exercise price or Deemed Exercise Price, as applicable,
thereof); (iii) the aggregate exercise price for all Cancelled Options; (iv)
the Series A Per Share Liquidation Preference Amount, the Series B Per Share
Liquidation Preference Amount, and/or the Estimated Per Common Share Closing
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the Shares represented by such
Certificate (and, with respect to each Option and Ungranted Option, the
portion of the Estimated Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration payable with
respect to such Option and Ungranted Option) and whether any Taxes are
required to be withheld by the Company or Buyer from such amounts (including
withholding Taxes to be taken into account in calculating the Grossed-Up
Expense Amount Contribution and the corresponding reduction in other amounts
paid to a Stockholder or Option Holder as described in Section 3.6(e)); (v)
the portion of each of the Earn-Out Payments, the Escrow Fund Release Amount
and the Representative Expense Fund Release Amount distributable with respect
to the Shares represented by such Certificate (or with respect to the Options
and Ungranted Options) held by such Securityholder, if ever; and (vi) such
other information which the Buyer may reasonably request at least four (4)
Business Days before the Closing Date.



77

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





(b) Other than as provided in this Agreement and the agreements referenced
herein, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and the payment of the consideration payable hereunder in respect of the
Shares and Cancelled Options as provided for in the Capital Structure
Certificate, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Company will
have no further obligations in respect of the Shares and Cancelled Options
(including any obligation to make any cash or non-cash payment in respect of
any such Shares or Cancelled Options).

Section 6.13 Termination of Benefit Plans

(a) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the Company shall withdraw from the Plan intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (the "401(k) Plan") and shall spin out the assets
and liabilities therefrom that are attributable to participants in such 401(k)
Plan who are the Company's current and former employees into a new plan
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code and immediately terminate
such new plan, unless Buyer provides written notice at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date that the Company shall not withdraw from such
401(k) Plan and such 401(k) Plan shall not be terminated. Unless Buyer
provides such written notice to the Company at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Buyer with evidence that
such 401(k) Plan has been terminated effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors
of the Company. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and reasonable approval of Buyer. The Company also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plan as Buyer may
reasonably require. In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or
other fees other than ordinary administrative expenses incurred in connection
with the plan freeze and termination then the Company shall take such actions
as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Buyer no later than fifteen (15) days
prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall terminate any and all group
severance, separation, deferred compensation or salary continuation plans,
programs or arrangements maintained by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
and all Plans set forth in Section 6.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedule. For the
avoidance of any doubt, the termination of the Plans pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be effected without any payment or benefit (or giving rights to
any payment or benefit, contingent or otherwise) thereunder. The Company shall
provide Buyer evidence that such Plans have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the boards of directors of the Company and of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to
review and reasonable approval of Buyer).

Section 6.14 Employee Matters.

(a) For a period of [*] following the Closing Date (the "Continuation
Period"), Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Surviving Company
to, provide to each employee of the Company who continues employment with
Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the



78

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





Surviving Company at the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") with
(i) a base salary or hourly wage rate (as applicable) that is at least equal
to that provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) an annual cash incentive opportunity for calendar year 2018 that is
at least equal to that provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (iii) employee health, welfare and severance
benefits (excluding retirement and equity incentives) that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to those provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained in this Section 6.14 shall affect Buyer's (or its applicable
Affiliate's) right to terminate any Continuing Employee after the Closing.

(b) Buyer shall use, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Surviving Company to
use, commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, each Continuing Employee
who continues employment with Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the Surviving
Company immediately following the Continuation Period receives full credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual, vacation
entitlement and severance benefits for service with the Company (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such past service
credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of
Buyer, its Affiliates or the Surviving Company, as applicable, in which such
employees are eligible to participate; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not apply (i) with respect to any defined benefit pension plan or
retiree medical benefits, or (ii) to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits.

(c) Except as provided for in this Section 6.14, nothing in this Agreement is
intended nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any
particular Plan, (ii) prevent Buyer from amending or terminating any of its
benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any employee
to employment with the Company, Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the Surviving
Company for any period of time (under Section 6.14(a) or otherwise), or (iv)
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or
benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or the Surviving Company or under any benefit plan which Buyer any
of its Affiliates or the Surviving Company may maintain.

Section 6.15 Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company.

(a) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Buyer will cause the Surviving Company to fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of the Company to its present and former
directors, officers, consultants and employees (the "Company Indemnified
Parties") pursuant to indemnification agreements with the Company in effect on
the date of this Agreement identified on Section 6.15(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule and pursuant to the Company Charter and bylaws, in each case, in
effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Indemnification
Provisions"), with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which are asserted after the
Effective Time. Any claims for indemnification made under this Section 6.15(a)
on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive such
anniversary until the final resolution thereof.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase tail insurance
coverage for the Company's directors and officers in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Buyer which shall provide such directors and
officers with coverage for no more than six (6) years following the Effective
Time with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (the "Insurance Coverage"), which Insurance
Coverage shall be reasonably comparable to the Company's insurance coverage
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Buyer shall maintain (or
cause the Surviving Company to maintain) such Insurance Coverage in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder during the term
thereof. The Insurance Coverage shall be accompanied by an endorsement that
names Buyer as a successor-in-interest thereto. To the extent that the premium
for such insurance coverage does not exceed a one-time payment of $125,000,
depending on the necessary timing of the payment, either (i) if the Company
pays such premium prior to the Closing, the Company shall be credited with the
amount of such premium paid as a current asset in the calculation of Net
Closing Working Capital, or (ii) if the premium is paid simultaneously with
the Closing or immediately following the Closing, the Buyer shall pay such
premium directly on the Company's behalf.

(c) This Section 6.15 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Party, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Company and Buyer, and shall be
enforceable by the Company Indemnified Parties, who are express third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.15; provided, however, that recourse shall
first be against the Insurance Coverage until it is exhausted before recovery
against Buyer shall take place. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the obligations under this Section 6.15 shall not be terminated or
modified in a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party
without the consent of such affected Company Indemnified Party.

(d) In the event that following the Effective Time, Buyer, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective heirs, successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment
for the benefit of creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the heirs,
successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Company, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.15.

Section 6.16 Financing. Buyer will have, on the date on which any Earn-Out
Payment is due under Section 3.8 of this Agreement, sufficient cash and
currently-available funds on hand to enable it to make such Earn-Out Payment.

the Closing and subject to the limitations contained in this Article VIII,
each of Buyer, the Surviving Company and their respective officers, directors,

(e) any amount paid by Buyer, the Company or the Surviving Company to any
Stockholder with respect to Dissenting Shares in excess of the Per Common
Share Merger Consideration paid by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement as of the

* * *





Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified and held harmless by Buyer from and
against all Losses incurred by the Securityholder Indemnified Parties arising
out of or resulting from:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub
contained in Article V or any certificate, agreement or other document
delivered pursuant hereto; or

(b) any breach of any covenant of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement.

Section 8.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) The party making a claim under this Article VIII (whether the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Securityholder Indemnified Parties) is referred to
as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against whom such claims are
asserted under this Article VIII (whether the Buyer or, collectively, the
Securityholders) is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party". For purposes of
this Article VIII, (i) if any Buyer Indemnified Party comprises the
Indemnified Party, any references to Indemnifying Party (except provisions
relating to an obligation to make or right to receive payments) shall be
deemed to refer to the Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders), and (ii) if Buyer comprises the Indemnifying Party, any
references to the Indemnified Party (except provisions relating to an
obligation to make or right to receive payments) shall be deemed to refer to
the Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders). Any
payment to be made to the Securityholders as the Indemnified Party shall be
distributed to the Paying Agent or shall be processed through the payroll
system of the Company, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as applicable, for further distribution to the Securityholders in
accordance with this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. If any
Indemnified Party receives written notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of
any penalty or assessment for which a claim for indemnification may be made
under this Article VIII (a "Third Party Claim") or otherwise discovers the
liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnity, and
such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article
VIII, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days, provide the Indemnifying Party with written notice of such
Third Party Claim, stating in reasonable detail the nature, basis and the
amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant
documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification
sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not prohibit
such Indemnified Party from seeking indemnification hereunder, except if and
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of a
Third Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of
a Third Party Claim, if, within thirty (30) days from receipt of any such
notice of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party provides written notice
to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party intends to undertake such
defense; provided, however, that if the Third Party Claim (w) is brought by a
Governmental Authority or involves potential criminal liability of the
Indemnified Party, (x) primarily seeks specific performance or injunctive or
other equitable relief and not monetary damages, (y) involves a claim for
patent infringement, or (z) seeks monetary



85

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





damages in excess of 200% of the amount available to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under the Escrow Fund and the Reserve Escrow Account, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such
Third Party Claim by providing written notice to the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of all
material events and developments, including promptly providing copies of any
correspondence and court filings, with respect to such matter. If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action and to participate in (but not control) the defense thereof. The
reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party (provided that such counsel shall discuss with
counsel to the Indemnifying Party prior to providing such opinion), (A) there
are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from
or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there
exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines separate counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not
to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, or fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
Section 8.3(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from such
Third Party Claim. The Stockholders' Representative and Buyer shall cooperate
with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of
any Third Party Claim, including making available records relating to such
Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of
actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of
the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of
the defense of such Third Party Claim.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not enter into settlement of any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, except as provided in this
Section 8.3(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without
leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the
part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying
Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall
give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within thirty (30) days
after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to
contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 8.3(a), it shall
not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be



86

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





unreasonably withheld or delayed (it being understood and agreed that it shall
be reasonable for the Stockholders' Representative to withhold such consent if
the Stockholders' Representative believes in good faith that there is not any
underlying basis for indemnification with respect to such settlement);
provided, that no settlement of any such Third Party Claim shall be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter, except with the
consent of the Stockholders' Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and which shall be deemed to have been given
unless the Stockholders' Representative shall have objected within thirty (30)
days after written request for such consent by the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

(c) This Section 8.3(c) and not Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) shall apply
with respect to Tax Claims. After the Closing, the Buyer Indemnified Party and
the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly notify the other party in
writing upon receipt of any written notice of any pending or threatened audit
or assessment, suit, proposed adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative
or judicial proceeding or similar claim relating to Taxes with respect to
damages for which Buyer may be indemnified under this Agreement (a "Tax
Claim"). Failure of the Buyer Indemnified Party to give such notice will not
prohibit such Buyer Indemnified Party from seeking indemnification hereunder,
except if and to the extent that the Stockholders' Representative, acting on
behalf of the Stockholders and Option Holders, is materially prejudiced
thereby. The Buyer Indemnified Party will control, without affecting its or
any other Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification under this Agreement,
the defense of all Tax Claims; provided, however, that the Stockholders'
Representative and its counsel (at the Securityholders' sole expense) may
participate in (but not control the conduct of) the defense of any such Tax
Claim, and provided, further, that the Buyer Indemnified Party may not settle
or compromise any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such taxable period ending on
and including the Closing Date, without the Stockholders' Representative's
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which does not
result from a Third Party Claim or a Tax Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim.
The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall state in reasonable detail the nature,
basis and the amount of the Direct Claim, to the extent known, along with
copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Direct Claim and the basis
for indemnification sought. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Party's investigation by giving such information and assistance as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond



87

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
agreed to such Direct Claim.

Section 8.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary except as
provided in Section 8.4(h), (i) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to assert any claim for indemnification under Section 8.1(a), other
than with respect to a breach of a Fundamental Representation, unless and
until the aggregate liability for Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties thereunder exceeds [*] (the "Threshold"); provided, that in the event
that the aggregate liability for Losses exceeds the Threshold, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover for all such Losses; (ii) the
aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Securityholders shall be liable
for indemnification under Sections 8.1(a) (other than with respect to a breach
of a Fundamental Representation or Actual Fraud by the Company) and 8.1(c),
shall not exceed [*]); (iii) [*]and (iv) [*] if any.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
Securityholder Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to assert any claim
for indemnification under Section 8.2(a) unless and until the aggregate
liability for Losses suffered by the Securityholder Indemnified Parties
thereunder exceeds [*]; provided, that in the event that the aggregate
liability for Losses exceeds [*], the Securityholder Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to recover for all such Losses ; and (ii) the aggregate amount of
all Losses for which Buyer shall be liable for indemnification under Section
8.2(a) shall not exceed [*].

(c) [*]. [*]. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 11.9, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall have no other remedies with respect to any and all
claims and Losses relating to or arising from this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than claims of, or causes of actions
arising from, Actual Fraud against the alleged perpetrator of such Actual
Fraud or a Securityholder who participated in or had actual knowledge of such
Actual Fraud) other than as set forth in the preceding sentences.

(d) The Buyer Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to
the extent required by applicable Law, to mitigate Losses for which
indemnification may be claimed by such party pursuant to this Agreement upon
and after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such Losses.

(e) The amount of any Losses that any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article VIII shall be reduced by any related
recoveries which such Buyer Indemnified Party actually receives under
applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any such Losses. If a Buyer Indemnified Party actually
receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an
indemnification payment being made by the Securityholders hereunder, then such
Buyer Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Paying Agent and Surviving
Company (as applicable) for distribution to the Securityholders, in each case
in an amount equal to such indemnification payment, up to the amount received
by the Buyer Indemnified Party, net of any previously unpaid or unreimbursed
expenses incurred by



88

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





such Buyer Indemnified Party in collecting such amount and the aggregate
increase in insurance premiums that are directly and proximately caused by
such Losses.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except to the
extent payable pursuant to a Third Party Claim or a Tax Claim, no Party shall
be liable to any other Party (including its respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors or assigns, as the case may be, hereunder) for any
punitive damages, except if and to the extent any such damages are recovered
against an Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third Party Claim or a Tax Claim.
Each Party hereby waives any claims that these exclusions deprive such party
of an adequate remedy.

(g) The Securityholders shall have no indemnification obligation for any Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries resulting from any action taken by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing on the Closing Date
outside the ordinary course of business.

(h) Subject to Section 11.9, each of Buyer, the Company (in its capacity as
the Surviving Company and the successor to Merger Sub) and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims and Losses relating to or arising
from this Agreement, any agreement entered into or document delivered in
connection with this Agreement (including the Joinder Agreements) or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, Actual Fraud in which the alleged perpetrator of such
Actual Fraud participated) shall be governed by, and subject to, the terms and
provisions set forth in this Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Article VIII will limit any Indemnified Party's right to seek
and obtain specific performance or injunctive relief to which any Party may be
entitled.

Section 8.5 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Subject to
the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, the representations
and warranties contained herein shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
full force and effect until the date that is [*]. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to
the extent known at such time) and in writing by notice from the Indemnified
Party to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration date of the applicable
survival period shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the
relevant representation or warranty and such claims shall survive until
finally resolved.

Section 8.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 8.7 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that
any such



89

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the
Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or
Section 7.3, as the case may be.

Section 8.8 Materiality. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, for purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred in
connection with any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or
any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation (but
not for purposes of determining the existence thereof), any and all references
to "Company Material Adverse Effect" (other than as set forth in Section
4.7(a))," "material" or other materiality terms shall be disregarded (it being
understood that the word "Material" in the defined term "Material Contract"
shall not be disregarded for any of such purposes).

Section 8.9 Additions to Escrow Account.

(a) In the event that prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in Section 8.5, Buyer has made a good faith claim for
indemnification that is not yet satisfied out of the Escrow Account (an
"Unresolved Claim"), and Buyer thereafter becomes obligated to make an Earn-
Out Payment pursuant to Section 3.8 at a time when such Unresolved Claim
remains open (or, in the case of any claim for indemnification under Sections
8.1(d), 8.1(e), 8.1(f), 8.1(g) or 8.1(h) that is related to payments to be
distributed pursuant to such Earn-Out Payment, a claim that occurs at the time
of such Earn-Out Payment), then, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 8.4(a), Buyer may deposit in an escrow account other than the Escrow
Account (the "Reserve Escrow Account") with the Escrow Agent governed by an
escrow agreement in substantially the same form as the Escrow Agreement (the
"Reserve Escrow Account Agreement") a portion of such Earn-Out Payment equal
to the portion of Buyer's good faith estimate of the Losses associated with
such Unresolved Claim recoverable under this Article VIII in excess of the
difference of (I) the balance of the Escrow Fund and the amount in the Reserve
Escrow Account at such time minus (II) Buyer's good faith estimate of the
Losses associated with any other Unresolved Claims that remain open (the
"Unresolved Claim Amount"). For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the
limitations in Section 8.4(a), any claim for indemnification that has settled
or been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and results in
Losses that have not been satisfied out of the Escrow Account shall be deemed
an "Unresolved Claim" hereunder.

(b) In the event Buyer exercises its right to deposit a portion of an Earn-Out
Payment in the Reserve Escrow Account pursuant to Section 8.9(a), Buyer shall
provide the Stockholders' Representative with written notice in advance
thereof (but in any event not later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
depositing a portion of such Earn-Out Payment). Such notice by Buyer shall
state in reasonable detail the nature, basis and the amount of the Unresolved
Claim, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Unresolved
Claim. In the event any Securityholder identifies any issues with or errors in
Buyer's good faith estimation, Buyer shall consider in good faith such
identified issues or errors and shall make downward revisions to such good
faith estimation as appropriate.

(c) In any case where Buyer is entitled to deposit a portion of an Earn-Out
Payment in the Reserve Escrow Account pursuant to Section 8.9(a), Buyer shall,
within fifteen



90

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





(15) Business Days after the date on which such Earn-Out Payment was due, (i)
deposit in the Reserve Escrow Account the amount by which such Earn-Out
Payment was reduced pursuant to Section 8.9(a) (each such payment, an "Escrow
Account Addition") for the purpose of securing the Unresolved Claim giving
rise to such Escrow Account Addition and (ii) deliver a written notice to the
Stockholders' Representative stating that Buyer has exercised its right to
deposit a portion of such Earn-Out Payment in the Reserve Escrow Account
pursuant to this Section 8.9, the amount so deposited and a confirmation that
such amount has been paid into the Reserve Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent
shall disburse any Escrow Account Additions (i) upon receipt of a written
instrument delivered to the Escrow Agent that is executed by both Buyer and
the Stockholders' Representative that instructs the Escrow Agent as to the
disbursement of some or all of the Escrow Account Additions to the
Securityholders or Buyer to be processed through the payroll system of the
Company, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
the case may be, or (ii) upon receipt of an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, a copy of which is delivered to the Escrow Agent by either Buyer
or the Stockholders' Representative, that instructs the Escrow Agent that some
or all of the Escrow Account Additions is required to be disbursed to the
Securityholders or Buyer to be processed through the payroll system of the
Company, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
the case may be. Any interest accrued upon an Escrow Account Addition shall be
paid to the recipient of such Escrow Account Addition; provided, that if such
Escrow Account Addition is divided among Buyer, the Securityholders, and/or is
processed through the payroll system of the Company, the Surviving Company or
any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as the case may be), the interest
accrued upon such Escrow Account Addition shall be divided among Buyer and the
Securityholders and processed through the payroll system of the Company, the
Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as the case may
be) in the same proportion as the Escrow Account Addition is divided and paid
to Buyer and the Securityholders and processed through the payroll system of
the Company, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(as the case may be).

ARTICLE IX 

STOCKHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE

Section 9.1 Stockholders' Representative.

(a) Appointment. By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the
Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, each Stockholder and Option Holder constitutes and appoints the
Stockholders' Representative to act as his, her or its representative, agent
and attorney-in-fact for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto, with full authority to act on behalf of, and
to bind, each such Person for purposes of this Agreement and the agreements
ancillary hereto, and the Stockholders' Representative hereby accepts such
appointment. The Stockholders' Representative shall have full power and
authority to represent all of such holders and their successors with respect
to all matters arising under this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto and all actions taken by



91

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





the Stockholders' Representative hereunder and thereunder shall be binding
upon all such Securityholders and their successors as if expressly confirmed
and ratified in writing by each of them. The Stockholders' Representative
shall be entitled to take any and all actions that it believes are necessary
or appropriate under this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto for
and on behalf of such Securityholders, as fully as if such Securityholders
were acting on their own behalf, including dealing with Buyer, the Paying
Agent and the Escrow Agent under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement with
respect to all matters arising hereunder or thereunder, taking any and all
other actions specified in or contemplated hereby or thereby, and engaging
counsel, accountants or other representatives, in connection with the
foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Stockholders' Representative shall have full power and authority to effect and
interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including the
determination of the Adjustment Amount, the prosecution, defense or settlement
of any claims for indemnification under Article VIII and the authorization of
disbursements and payments in accordance with the terms hereof) and the Escrow
Agreement and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of all
such Securityholders and their successors.

(b) Exculpation and Indemnification of the Stockholders' Representative. The
Stockholders' Representative may act upon any instrument or other writing
believed by the Stockholders' Representative in good faith to be genuine and
to be signed or presented by the proper Person. The Stockholders'
Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action
or omission by the Stockholders' Representative in connection with its
services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto,
except in the event of liability directly resulting from the Stockholders'
Representative's Actual Fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission
pursuant to the advice of nationally recognized outside counsel. The
Securityholders shall, severally (based on each Securityholder's Pro Rata
Share compared to the aggregate of the Pro Rata Shares of all Securityholders)
and not jointly, indemnify the Stockholders' Representative and its members,
managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees
(collectively, the "Stockholders' Representative Group") from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location,
duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out
of or in connection with the Stockholders' Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the Actual Fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Stockholders' Representative, the Stockholders'
Representative will reimburse the Securityholders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such Actual
Fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Stockholders' Representative Group by the Securityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the members of the Stockholders'
Representative Group from (i) the Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount,
(ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Securityholders, and (iii) from any Earn-Out
Payments at such time as any such amounts would otherwise be distributable to
the Securityholders; provided, that while this



92

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





section allows the Stockholders' Representative Group to be paid from the
aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Securityholders
from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholders' Representative
Group from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no
event will the Stockholders' Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Securityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of the Securityholders set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Stockholders' Representative under this section.
The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal
of the Stockholders' Representative or the termination of this Agreement.
Furthermore, the Stockholders' Representative shall not be required to take
any action unless the Stockholders' Representative has been provided with
funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to
protect the Stockholders' Representative against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which would reasonably be expected to be incurred by the
Stockholders' Representative in performing such actions. In no event shall the
Stockholders' Representative be liable hereunder or in connection herewith for
any indirect, punitive damages, special damages or consequential damages.

(c) Access to Information. The Stockholders' Representative shall be given
reasonable access (upon reasonable advance written notice and during normal
business hours) by Buyer to all information of and concerning any claims for
indemnification under Article VIII and which is in the possession, custody or
control of Buyer or the Surviving Company and the reasonable assistance of
Buyer's and the Surviving Company's officers and employees as is reasonably
necessary for purposes of performing the Stockholders' Representative's duties
under this Agreement and exercising its rights under this Agreement, including
for the purpose of evaluating any claims for indemnification under Article
VIII by any Buyer Indemnified Party provided, however, that the Stockholders'
Representative shall treat confidentially and not, except in connection with
enforcing its rights under this Agreement, disclose any nonpublic information
from or concerning any claims for indemnification under Article VIII to anyone
(except to the Stockholders' Representative's attorneys, accountants or other
advisers, to Securityholders and on a need-to-know basis to other individuals
who have agreed to keep such information confidential pursuant to a standard
non-disclosure agreement).

(b) Reasonable Reliance. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the
Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any document or
instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine, accurate as to content and
signed by any Stockholder or Option Holder, Buyer, the Escrow Agent or the
Paying Agent. The Stockholders' Representative may assume that any Person
purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has
been duly authorized to do so. Buyer may rely and shall be protected in
acting, or refraining from acting, upon any written notice, instruction or
request furnished to it hereunder and reasonably believed by Buyer to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the Stockholders'
Representative as if such written notice, instruction or request had been
furnished to it by all the Securityholders. The Stockholders' Representative
may, in all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of
counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in



93

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





good faith by the Stockholders' Representative in accordance with such advice,
and the Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable to the
Securityholders in connection therewith.

(c) Attorney-in-Fact.

(i) The Stockholders' Representative is hereby appointed and constituted the
true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder and Option Holder with
full power in their name and on their behalf to act according to the terms of
this Agreement in the good faith discretion of the Stockholders'
Representative; and in general to do all things and to perform all acts
including, without limitation, executing and delivering any other agreements,
certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments contemplated by
or deemed advisable in connection with this Agreement. Such appointment shall
be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest.

(ii) This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and
shall be irrevocable, subject to replacement of the Stockholders'
Representative pursuant to Section 9.1(f), and shall not be terminated by any
act of any Stockholder or Option Holder by operation of Law, whether by such
holder's death, disability, protective supervision or any other event.

(iii) Each Stockholder and Option Holder waives any and all defenses that may
be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Stockholders'
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement.

(iv) Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this Section 9.1, no
agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document shall be
ineffective by reason only of a Stockholder or Option Holder having signed or
given such act or document directly instead of the Stockholders'
Representative.

(d) Liability. If the Stockholders' Representative is required to determine
the occurrence of any event or contingency, the Stockholders' Representative
may request from any Stockholder or Option Holder or any other Person such
reasonable additional evidence as the Stockholders' Representative in its sole
discretion may deem necessary to determine any fact relating to the occurrence
of such event or contingency, and may at any time inquire of and consult with
others, including any Stockholder or Option Holder, and the Stockholders'
Representative shall not be liable to any such Stockholder or Option Holder,
as the case may be, for any damages resulting from its delay in acting
hereunder pending its receipt and examination of additional evidence requested
by it. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in no event shall the
Stockholders' Representative, in its capacity as such, be liable to Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates (other than for Actual Fraud or willful
misconduct or gross negligence).

(e) Successor Representatives. The Securityholders shall designate one or more
Persons reasonably acceptable to the Securityholders collectively having a Pro
Rata Share



94

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





greater than 50% to serve as successor Stockholders' Representative in the
event of the Stockholders' Representative's incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or resignation, which Person or Persons shall in such event
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the Stockholders' Representative under this Agreement. Each
successor Stockholders' Representative shall designate one or more Persons
reasonably acceptable to the Securityholders collectively having a Pro Rata
Share greater than 50% to serve as successor Stockholders' Representative in
the event of such successor Stockholders' Representative's death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or resignation.

following circumstances:

(a) any order, decree, ruling or other non-appealable final action has been

failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or
failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement, and (ii) if

or Merger Sub of any material representation, warranty, covenant or other

Section 11.4 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time prior to the Effective Time by mutual
agreement of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholders'
Representative, except as provided in Section 251(d) of the DGCL. Any
amendment, modification or revision of this Agreement and any waiver of
compliance or consent with respect hereto shall be effective only if in a
written instrument executed by the Parties.

Section 11.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Enforcement. The law, including the
statutes of limitation, of the State of Delaware shall govern this Agreement,
the interpretation and enforcement of its terms and any claim or cause of
action (in law or equity), controversy or dispute arising out of or related to
it or its negotiation, execution or performance, whether based on contract,
tort, statutory or other law, in each case without giving effect to any
conflicts-of-law or other principle requiring the application of the law of
any other jurisdiction.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby (i)
consents to service of process in any legal action, suit or proceeding among
the parties to this Agreement arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement
in any manner permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) agrees that
service of process made in accordance with this Section 11.5 or made by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to Section 11.3, will constitute good and valid service of
process in any such legal action, suit or proceeding, and (iii) waives and
agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or



98

* Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* * *





otherwise) in any such legal action, suit or proceeding any claim that service
of process made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good
and valid service of process. Each of the Parties (a) consents to submit
itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, New Castle County, or if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the Parties waives any defense or inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other Party with respect
thereto.

(b) Without limiting the third party beneficiary rights described in Section
11.2, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than pursuant to the Voting
Agreements, the Joinder Agreements, or a Letter of Transmittal) may only be
brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto (and,
with respect to Article IX, against the Securityholders) and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent they are a named party to this Agreement (and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party
in this Agreement and not otherwise) or as set forth in a Voting Agreement, a

VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
11.6.

Section 11.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of the Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to give effect to
the original intent of the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 11.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission), each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or by electronic delivery in
PDF or other electronic format based on common standards will be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 11.9 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the covenants or agreements set forth
herein were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof or were
otherwise breached and that each of the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of such covenants and agreements
and to enforce specifically such covenants and agreements (without any
requirement to post any bond or other security in connection with seeking such
relief), in addition to any other remedy at law or equity, exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). The Parties agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, and to
prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the parties under this
Agreement. For purposes of this Section 11.9, each of the Parties hereby
consents to service of process in accordance with the terms of Section
11.5(b).

Section 11.10 Mutual Drafting. The Parties acknowledge that they are
sophisticated parties and have been represented by legal counsel throughout
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that the terms of the provisions hereof have been
carefully negotiated by such legal counsel. Accordingly, the Parties hereby
agree that the presumptions of Laws or rules relating to the interpretation of
contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should not be applied
to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in connection
herewith, and each Party hereby waives the application thereof.

Section 11.11 Continuing Counsel. Buyer and Merger Sub each hereby
acknowledges that Goodwin Procter LLP ("Goodwin") has acted as counsel to the
Company with respect to this

Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer
and Merger Sub agrees that it will not, and will cause the Surviving Company
not to, seek to disqualify Goodwin from acting or continuing to act as counsel
to the Stockholders' Representative (solely in its capacity as the
Stockholders' Representative) and/or certain or all of the Securityholders in
connection with a dispute hereunder or in any way related to any inquiry,
investigation, claim, litigation, or proceeding relating to the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Merger Sub further agree that, as
to all communications among any counsel for the Company or any Securityholder,
including, but not limited to, Goodwin or any outside or in-house counsel, and
the Company, the Stockholders' Representative and/or any such Securityholder
that relate in any way to the Merger, the transactions contemplated hereby or
any similar actual or potential transaction prior to the Closing (the
"Privileged Information"), the attorney-client privilege and the expectation
of client confidence belongs to the Stockholders' Representative and/or any
such Securityholders and may be controlled by the Stockholders' Representative
and any such Securityholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates. Neither Buyer
nor Merger Sub will seek to obtain such communications, whether by seeking a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege or through other means, and neither
Goodwin nor any other counsel for the Company shall have any duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose to Buyer or Merger Sub any such Privileged Information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer, the Surviving Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third
party other than the Stockholders' Representative or a Securityholder, on the
other hand, Buyer, the Surviving Company and its Affiliates may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
to such third party; provided, however, that neither Buyer, the Surviving
Company or its Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders' Representative.
