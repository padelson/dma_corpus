(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
on the Closing Date, (i) the Buyer agrees to purchase from the Sellers, and
the Sellers agree to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to the Buyer, the
Seller Interests, (ii) the Buyer agrees to purchase from the Blocker Sellers,
and the Blocker Sellers agree to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to the
Buyer, the Blocker Interests, in the case of each of clause (i) and clause
(ii), free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for restrictions on transfer
imposed by applicable securities Laws and Encumbrances created by the Buyers
or its Affiliates acts, and (iii) in exchange for the sale contemplated by
clauses (i) and (ii), the Buyer agrees to pay the Estimated Purchase Price
(together with any adjustments pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (Working Capital;
Closing Date RMR)).

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Closing, each option to purchase limited
liability company interests of the Target (each, a " _Target Option_ ") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, as set forth on _Exhibit A_,
shall, if unvested, vest and become exercisable in full. Each holder of an
unexercised Target Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing
(a " _Target Optionholder_ ") will be entitled to receive from the Purchase
Price, in cancellation of its Target Option, a cash payment, (i) at the
Closing, in an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of limited
liability company interests provided for in such Target Option and (B) an
amount equal to (x) the imputed price per Seller Interest derived from the
Estimated Purchase Price _minus_ (y) the exercise price per interest provided
for in such Target Option and (ii) a pro rata portion of any amounts released

Seller, such payment shall be treated as a guaranteed payment for services and
as net earnings from self-employment, and with respect to any Target
Optionholder who is not a Seller, such payment shall be treated as
compensation for services and shall be net of any applicable withholding
taxes. The Sellers Representative (and not the Buyer) shall be solely
responsible to ensure the payment to all Target Optionholders of the amounts
payable to them under this _Section 2.1(b)_ (Purchase and Sale of Interests
and Blocker Interests; Cancellation of Target Options), and Buyer shall have
no obligation with respect thereto (other than pursuant to its obligations
under _Section 2.2(c)(iv)_ (Closing) and, if applicable, _Sections 2.3(e)_
and _(f)_ ) (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR).

of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Buyer and timely paid to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to such Seller or Blocker Seller, as
applicable.

sheet, (ii) none of the Sellers or the Blocker Sellers shall have any
Liabilities with respect thereto and (iii) no amounts set forth therein shall
be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ (Working Capital; Closing Date

(b) No later than the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, Buyer will
prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the Sellers

Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement ( _provided_ , _that_ , if
Buyer fails to deliver the Closing Statement within the ninety (90) day period
described in _Section 2.3(b)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR), then the
Estimated Closing Statement will be treated as the Closing Statement for all
purposes of this _Section 2.3_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR)), the
Sellers Representative and its Representatives and advisors

 



      
 

 



 

(i) will be permitted to review, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records and
their and their outside accountants working papers related or relevant to the

determinations included therein) will become final, binding and conclusive
upon Buyer, the Company, the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers (collectively,
the " _Interested Persons_ ") (A) on the sixtieth (60th) day following the
Sellers Representatives receipt thereof, unless Buyer receives from the
Sellers Representative on or prior to such sixtieth (60th) day written notice
of the Sellers Representatives disagreement (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") with
any account or determination set forth in the Closing Statement or (B) on such
earlier date as the Sellers Representative notifies Buyer in writing that it
does not dispute the Closing Statement. The Dispute Notice will specify the
items in the Closing Statement disputed by the Sellers Representative
(collectively, the " _Disputed Items_ "). Any item set forth or reflected on
the Closing Statement that is not objected to in the Dispute Notice will be
deemed final, binding and conclusive upon the Interested Persons upon delivery
of the Dispute Notice. If the Sellers Representative timely delivers the
Dispute Notice, then the Closing Statement will become final, binding and
conclusive upon the Interested Persons on the first to occur of (x) the date
on which Buyer and the Sellers Representative resolve in writing all
differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items or (y) the date on
which all of the Disputed Items that are not resolved by Buyer and the
Sellers Representative in writing are finally resolved in writing by the
Independent Accountants in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_ (Working Capital;
Closing Date RMR).

 



 

(d) During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a Dispute Notice, Buyer
and the Sellers Representative will seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items. Any Disputed
Item agreed in writing by Buyer and the Sellers Representative will be deemed
final, binding and conclusive on the Interested Persons when such written
agreement has been entered into by each of Buyer and the Sellers
Representative. If Buyer and the Sellers Representative do not reach
agreement on all of the Disputed Items during such thirty (30) day period (or
such longer period as they shall mutually agree), then at the end of such
thirty (30) day (or longer) period Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
submit all unresolved Disputed Items (collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_
") to Deloitte LLP ( _provided_ , _that_ , if Deloitte LLP does not accept
such engagement, such independent nationally recognized accounting firm as
mutually selected by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative) (the "
_Independent Accountants_ ") to review and resolve such matters. The scope of
the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accountants shall be limited to
fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the Unresolved Items were
determined in accordance with this Agreement and whether there were errors in
the calculation of the

 



      
 

 



 

items set forth in the Closing Statement (including the Closing Date RMR and
the Purchase Price). The Independent Accountants will determine each
Unresolved Item (the amount of which may not be more favorable to Buyer than
the related amount reflected in the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer under
_Section 2.3(b)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR) nor more favorable to
the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers than any related amount set forth in the
Dispute Notice) in accordance with this _Section 2.3(d)_ and _Section
2.3(c)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR) as promptly as may be reasonably
practicable, and Buyer and the Sellers Representative will instruct the
Independent Accountants to complete such process within a period of no more
than sixty (60) days from the date of its engagement. The Independent
Accountants shall act as an arbitrator to resolve each Unresolved Item based
solely on written presentations by Buyer and the Sellers Representative and
their respective agents, and not by independent review. Except as Buyer and
the Sellers Representative may otherwise agree in writing, all communications
with respect to this _Section 2.3_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR)
between Buyer and the Sellers Representative or any of their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Independent Accountants, on the
other hand, will be in writing, with copies simultaneously delivered to the
non-communicating party. The Independent Accountants determination of the
Unresolved Items will be final, binding and conclusive on the Interested
Persons, effective as of the date the Independent Accountants written
determination is received by Buyer and the Sellers Representative. During the
review by the Independent Accountants, Buyer, the Sellers Representative and
their respective representatives shall make available to the Independent
Accountants interviews with such individuals and such information, books and
records and workpapers as may be reasonably required by the Independent
Accountants to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.3_ (Working
Capital; Closing Date RMR). The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants will be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Sellers
Representative (for the account of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers), and
each of Buyer and the Sellers Representative (for the account of the Sellers
and the Blocker Sellers) will bear its own legal, accounting and other fees
and expenses of participating in such dispute resolution procedure. For
purposes of this Agreement, the " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall mean the
Closing Statement, as finally determined pursuant to the terms and conditions
of _Section 2.3(c)_ or _(d)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR), as

determined pursuant to the terms and conditions of _Section 2.3(c)_ or _(d)_
(Working Capital; Closing Date RMR), " _Final Closing Date RMR_ " means the
Closing Date RMR as finally determined pursuant to the terms and conditions of
_Section 2.3(c)_ or _(d)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR), and the "

each case as set forth in the Final Closing Statement; it being understood
that the Final Closing Statement shall be subject in all respects to the third
sentence of _Section 2.3(g)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR).

 



 

(e) Upon determination of the Final Closing Working Capital, an adjustment
will be determined and paid as follows (subject to any payment previously made
under _Section 2.3(d)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR)):

 



      
 

 



 

(i) If the Target Working Capital exceeds the Final Closing Working Capital,
the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall within five (5) Business Days

Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer the amount of such excess out of the Escrow
Funds, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by Buyer.

equal to the difference between the Estimated Purchase Price and the Final
Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, the
Buyer shall within five (5) Business Days after such final determination pay
to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers, Blocker Sellers and
the Target Optionholders), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account specified by the Sellers Representative, an amount equal to the
difference between the Estimated Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price.

 



 

(g) The payments required under _Section 2.3(e)_ and _(f)_ (Working Capital;
Closing Date RMR) shall occur simultaneously with one another (subject to any
payment previously made under _Section 2.3(d)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date
RMR)); _provided_ , _that_ , in no event shall the amounts paid to the Buyer
under this _Section 2.3_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR) exceed the
Escrow Funds. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each accounting
term used herein will have the meaning that is applied thereto in accordance
with GAAP. Each of the items set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, the
Closing Statement and the Final Closing Statement will be calculated in

 **SECTION 3.29** ** ****Private Placement**

 



 

If and to the extent that the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers receive the

Seller or Blocker Seller has any contract, undertaking, agreement or
arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participation to any
third person with respect to any of the Ascent Shares which such Seller or
Blocker Seller may receive. Each Seller and each Blocker Seller understands
that the Ascent Shares have not been registered under the 1933 Act by reason
of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the 1933 Act which
depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment
intent as expressed herein;

experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating

Indemnity) are in lieu of and are exclusive of all other representations and
warranties, whether at law or in equity, including (i) any implied warranties,
(ii) claims of inducement to enter into the Transactions and (iii) as to the
accuracy or completeness of, or reasonableness of any assumptions underlying
any estimates, projections and forecasts set forth in, any information,

contrary herein, (i) neither PCP nor BNY make any representations or
warranties with respect to the business or operations of the Sold Entities (or
any Subsidiary thereof) which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include those

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER AND ASCENT**

 



 

Buyer, except as to _Section 4.7_ (Ascent Reports and Financial Statements),
_4.8_ (Ascent Capital Stock) and _4.9(a)_ (Share Authorization; Ownership),
and Ascent, except as to _Sections 4.6_ (Solvency), _4.10_ (Certain
Acknowledgements), and _4.11_ (Taxes), each hereby represent and warrant to
the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date, as follows:

 



 

 **SECTION 4.1** ** ****Organization and Qualification**

 



 

Each of Buyer and Ascent is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each of
Buyer and Ascent is duly qualified to conduct its business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned,
operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to so qualify, individually and in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent, or materially delay,
the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
Buyer and Ascent has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate, lease and otherwise to hold and operate its assets and properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure of
Buyer or Ascent to have any of the foregoing does not, and would not
reasonably be expected to, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise prevent Buyer or Ascent from performing its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.2** ** ****Authority**

 



 

Each of Buyer and Ascent has the necessary corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Transactions contemplated hereby. Ascent has the necessary
corporate power and authority to issue, sell and deliver the Ascent Shares.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of Buyer and
Ascent and the consummation by each of Buyer and Ascent of the Transactions
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no
other corporate proceedings or approvals on the part of Buyer or Ascent are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Buyer and Ascent
and, assuming its due authorization, execution, delivery and performance by
each other party hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
each of Buyer and Ascent, enforceable against Buyer and Ascent in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization,

 



      
 

 



 

moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally and by the application of general
principles of equity.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.3** ** ****No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents**

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of Buyer
and Ascent do not, and the performance by each of Buyer and Ascent of its
obligations under this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with or violate,
result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Buyer or Ascent, (ii) subject to compliance with
the requirements of the HSR Act, conflict with or violate any Law applicable
to Buyer or Ascent or by which any of its properties is bound or affected, or
(iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to
others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) on any of the properties or assets of Buyer or Ascent or their
respective Subsidiaries pursuant to (A) any material contract to which Buyer
or Ascent or their respective Subsidiaries, or their assets or properties may
be bound or subject, or (B) any permit of Buyer or Ascent or their respective
Subsidiaries except, in each case, for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults, accelerations or occurrences that in the aggregate would
not and would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Except as required under the HSR Act and as set forth in _Schedule
4.3(b)_, no Consents are necessary to be obtained, made or given by Buyer or
Ascent in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer or
Ascent of this Agreement, the performance by Buyer or Ascent of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Transactions, except for
where the failure to obtain such Consents would not prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Buyer or
Ascent from performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material
respect.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.4** ** ****Absence of Litigation**

 



 

There are (a) no Actions pending or threatened in writing or, to the knowledge
of Buyer or Ascent, otherwise threatened against or affecting Buyer or Ascent
or their respective Subsidiaries, relating to the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, by or before any Governmental Entity, that challenge or seek
to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the Transactions, and (b) no
Orders outstanding against Buyer or Ascent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries relating to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
each case of clause (a) and (b) other than any such Action or Order that would
not and would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, the knowledge of
Buyer or Ascent shall be the actual knowledge of William Fitzgerald, William
Niles, John Orr, Michael Haislip and Michael Meyers

 



 

 **SECTION 4.5** ** ****Brokers**

 



 

No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders
or other fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on

 



      
 

 



 

behalf of Buyer or Ascent or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, other than the fees or commissions associated with the
Financing, which are the sole obligations of Buyer and Ascent.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.6** ** ****Solvency**

 



 

After giving effect to the Transactions, Buyer will be able to pay its debts
as such debts become due, will have capital sufficient to carry out its
business as now contemplated, and will own property having a value both at
fair market valuation and at fair saleable value in the ordinary course of
business greater than the amount required to pay its Indebtedness and other
obligations as the same mature and become due.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.7** ** ****Ascent Reports and Financial Statements**

 



 

The Ascent Commission Filings constitute all of the documents (other than
preliminary materials) that Ascent was required to file with the SEC since
December 31, 2010 to the date of this Agreement. As of their respective dates,
each of the Ascent Commission Filings complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated under each of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, and, at
the time filed, none of the Ascent Commission Filings contained as of such
date any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. When filed with the SEC, the financial statements included in the
Ascent Commission Filings were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes or schedules
thereto), and such financial statements fairly present the consolidated
financial position of Ascent and its consolidated cash flows for the periods
then ended, subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to
normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.8** ** ****Ascent Capital Stock**

 



 

The authorized capital stock of Ascent conforms as to legal matters to the
description thereof contained in the Registration Statement on Form 8-A of
Ascent filed on September 17, 2008, as amended or supplemented to the date
hereof. _Schedule 4.8_ sets forth a true and correct statement of the
authorized shares of each class or series of capital stock of Ascent, the
number of shares outstanding of each such class or series as of April 26,
2013, and the number of shares of each class or series of capital stock
issuable upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of outstanding rights,
warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities which are exercisable or
exchangeable for, or convertible into, capital stock of Ascent.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.9** ** ****Share Authorization; Ownership**

 



 

(a) The Ascent Shares have been duly authorized and, if and when issued and
delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of any Encumbrances
other than any restrictions on transfer imposed by applicable securities Laws,
and any issuance of such Ascent Shares will not be subject to any preemptive
or similar rights.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Ascent will transfer and deliver at the Closing valid title to the Ascent
Shares, free and clear of any Encumbrance, other than restrictions arising
under applicable Law, arising under this Agreement, or created by the Sellers
Representative, any Seller, any Blocker Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates.

representations and warranties made in _Article III_ (Representations and

Sellers expressly contained in this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely on its
own independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of the Sold Entities
(including as to the accuracy or completeness of, or reasonableness of any
assumptions underlying any estimates, projections and forecasts set forth in
any information, documents or materials regarding the Sold Entities (including
any pro forma financial information, supplemental data or financial
projections or other forward-looking statements) furnished or made available
to Buyer or its Representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms,"
management presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in
connection with, the Transactions).

 



 

(c) Buyer acknowledges that none of the Sellers, the Blocker Sellers, the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates has made or

 **SECTION 5.5** ** ****Cooperation and Reasonable Best Efforts**

 



 

From the date hereof to and including the earlier of (x) the Closing Date and
(y) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, (a) each of the parties hereto
shall cooperate with each other, and each of the Sellers and each of the
Blocker Sellers shall cause the Sold Entities to cooperate with the Buyer and
Ascent, in connection with consummating the Transactions, and (b) each of the
parties hereto agrees to, and each of the Sellers and each of the Blocker
Sellers shall cause each of the Sold Entities to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the Transactions. Each Seller and
each Blocker Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives and its Affiliates
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing as may be requested by Buyer, including as contemplated by
_Section 5.10_ (Interim Financial Statements). Buyer shall, promptly upon
request by the Sellers, the Blocker Sellers or any of their Affiliates,
reimburse the Sellers or the Blocker Sellers for any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by the Sellers or the Blocker Sellers or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives in connection with its cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing. For purposes of this _Section 5.5_
(Cooperation and Reasonable Best Efforts), the covenant of the parties to use
their "reasonable best efforts" shall not require any party to (i) incur any
expenses (A) except as specifically provided in this Agreement, (B) except
that the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall pay any and all amounts
required to be paid to the applicable lenders in connection with obtaining the
Payoff Letters, and (C) unless the party requesting the action resulting in
such expense agrees to reimburse such other party for such expenses, (ii)
agree to limit the conduct of its business in any material respect or (iii)
divest itself of, or hold separate, any material assets or properties, in each
case except as otherwise expressly contemplated hereunder, and shall not
require the Buyer to accept any Financing that is

 



      
 

 



 

not acceptable to it in its sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, other
than as set forth in the prior sentence, the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers
shall not be required to incur any expenses in connection with obtaining any
necessary Consents as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.6** ** ****Consents and Approvals**

 



 

As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, each of the parties
hereto shall, and the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall cause each of the
Sold Entities to, use its reasonable best efforts in connection with the
Transactions to obtain any necessary Consents from, and make any filing with
or give any notice to, any Governmental Entities and other Persons as are
required to be obtained, made or given by such party to consummate the
Transactions. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers and Blocker Sellers, on
the other hand, shall each pay half of the filing fee required to be paid
under the HSR Act. The parties acknowledge that on June 25, 2013, Ascent and

foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(a) respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Entity regarding antitrust or
other matters with respect to the Transactions; and (b) avoid the imposition
of any Order or the taking of any action that would restrain, alter or enjoin
the Transactions; and in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions has been issued, to
have such Governmental Order vacated or lifted; _provided_ , _that_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.6_ (Consents and Approvals)
shall not require Buyer to take any action on the part of Buyer that would
reasonably result in a requirement for Buyer to dispose of, or hold separate,
the Ultimate Interests, the Blocker Interests or any material asset of the
Buyer.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.7** ** ****Notification of Certain Matters**

 



 

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Sellers and the
Blocker Sellers shall give prompt notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt
notice to the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, (i) of any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to
obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to delay or prohibit the
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) of any Action (whether civil, criminal
or administrative) commenced relating to or otherwise affecting such party or
any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, and (iii) if such
party becomes aware of any fact, circumstance or event (A) that would
reasonably be expected to constitute a Material Adverse Effect or cause a
material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein
or (B) which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition set forth
in _Articles VI_ (Conditions Precedent to Obligations of Buyer) or _VII_
(Conditions Precedent to Obligations of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers)
not being able to be satisfied at Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it
is understood and agreed that neither the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 5.7_ (Notification of Certain Matters) nor any disclosures
provided thereby shall affect any of the rights, remedies or obligations of
the parties hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 5.8** ** ****Further Assurances**

 



 

In the event that after the Closing Date any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers of
each party to this Agreement, in their respective capacities as such, shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take all such actions.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.9** ** ****Alternative Transactions**

 



 

(a) The Sellers, the Blocker Sellers, each of the Sold Entities and each of
their respective Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, Representatives and agents shall
immediately cease any existing discussions, communications or negotiations, if
any, with any Persons (" _Prior Bidders_ "), other than the Buyer and its
Representatives, conducted heretofore with respect to any direct or indirect
acquisition of all or any significant portion of the assets or properties of,
or any limited liability company interest or shares of capital stock
(including the Ultimate Interests and the Blocker Interests) or other equity
interest in, the Sold Entities or any business combination with the Sold
Entities (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) or any other
transaction inconsistent with the consummation of, or similar in whole or in
part to, the Transactions contemplated herein (any of the foregoing, an "
_Alternative Transaction_ "), and shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit,
encourage, facilitate, participate in or initiate any proposals or discussions
or negotiations with, or enter into any understandings, arrangements or
agreements with, or provide any information or documents to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, any Person (other than the Buyer and its
Representatives) concerning any Alternative Transaction. Effective at the
Closing, the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall assign to the Buyer the
non-exclusive right to enforce the rights, if any, of the Sellers and the
Blocker Sellers and their Affiliates under any and all confidentiality
agreements entered into with Prior Bidders and other prospective acquirors of
each of the Sold Entities, and to the extent any such rights are not so
assignable to Buyer, the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall, following the
Closing, use their reasonable best efforts to cause all confidential or
proprietary materials relating to each of the Sold Entities previously
furnished to Prior Bidders or other Persons in connection with an Alternative
Transaction to be promptly returned to the Company or destroyed.

 



 

(b) The parties acknowledge that there may be no adequate remedy at law for a
breach of _Section 5.9(a)_ (Alternative Transactions) and that money damages
may not be an adequate remedy for breach of such Section. Therefore, the
parties agree that the Buyer shall have the right, in addition to the other
rights it may have, to seek injunctive relief and specific performance of
_Section 5.9(a)_ (Alternative Transactions) in the event of any breach of
such Section. The remedies set forth in the preceding two (2) sentences are
cumulative and shall in no way limit any other remedy any party hereto has at
law, in equity or pursuant hereto.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.10** ** ****Interim Financial Statements**

 



 

(a) Each of the Sellers and each of the Blocker Sellers agrees to, and to
cause each of the Sold Entities to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer and KPMG
LLP, and to cause

 



       
 

 



 

the Companys existing auditors to reasonably cooperate with Buyer and KPMG
LLP, with respect to KPMG LLP reviewing, preparing or, at the expense of
Buyer, taking any other action reasonably requested by Buyer relating to any
quarterly or annual consolidated financial statements of any Sold Entity, in
connection with the Financing and the provision of comfort or similar letters
required to be delivered in order to complete the Financing. Buyer agrees to
reasonably cooperate with the Sellers, the Blocker Sellers, the Sold Entities,
KPMG LLP and the Companys existing auditors in connection with the
performance of the covenants set forth in this _Section 5.10_ (Interim
Financial Statements) and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause KPMG LLP
to complete its review as promptly as reasonably practicable of the financial
statements required to be delivered under this _Section 5.10_ (Interim

KPMG LLP in the performance of the services contemplated by this _Section

Financial Statements_ ") and of each other Sold Entity as of and for the
three- (3) and six- (6) month period ended June 30, 2013 (the " _Other Sold

applicable Sold Entity and in accordance with GAAP, except for any absence of
required footnotes and except for normal year-end adjustments, (ii) fairly

(c) In the event that the Termination Date is extended in accordance with
_Section 8.1(c)_ (Events of Termination), as soon as practicable after they
become available (and in any event within twenty two (22) days after the end
of each calendar quarter (other than the quarters ended March 31, 2013 and
ended June 30, 2013)), the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall deliver to
the Buyer true, correct and complete copies of the quarterly or annual
consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of income and

(iv) Intermediate shall then be treated as making a capital contribution to SN
Holdings of the amount deemed to be received by Intermediate pursuant to
clause (iii), (v) SN Holdings shall then be treated as making a capital
contribution to the Company of the amounts deemed to be received by SN
Holdings pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv), and (vi) the Company shall then
be treated as paying the Indebtedness Repayment Amount to the administrative

respective Affiliates or

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives. In furtherance of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall indemnify, without limitation,
and hold harmless the Sellers, the Sold Entities, their respective Affiliates,

from the date of its initial effectiveness until the earlier of (i) the six-
(6) month anniversary of the first Business Day following the effectiveness of
the Shelf Registration Statement and (ii) such time as there are no
Registrable Securities remaining (such period, the " _Effectiveness Period_
"). Ascent shall file the Shelf Registration Statement as an automatic shelf
registration statement, subject to applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Except as specifically provided herein, all Registration Expenses incurred
in connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities shall be
borne by Ascent, and all Selling Expenses shall be borne by the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers).

 



 

(c) Whenever required to facilitate the distribution of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, Ascent shall, as expeditiously
as reasonably practicable:

 



 

(i) Prepare and file with the SEC a prospectus supplement with respect to a
proposed offering of Registrable Securities by a Seller or a Blocker Seller
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement;

 



 

(ii) Reasonably in advance of filing a prospectus supplement or Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus with respect to a proposed offering of Registrable
Securities by a Seller or a Blocker Seller with the SEC, furnish to the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of such Seller or such Blocker Seller) a
copy of such prospectus supplement or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as
proposed to be filed (including documents to be incorporated by reference
therein, to the extent not then available via the SECs EDGAR system, but only
to the extent they expressly relate to any offering to be effected
thereunder), and Ascent will not file such prospectus supplement or Issuer
Free Writing Prospectus with respect to a proposed offering of Registrable
Securities (or any such documents

 



      
 

 



 

incorporated by reference) containing any statements with respect to any
Seller or Blocker Seller or the plan of distribution to which the Sellers
Representative shall reasonably object in writing;

 



 

(iii) Furnish to each Seller or Blocker Seller such number of copies of the
prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement as the Sellers
Representative may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition
of its Registrable Securities owned or to be distributed by it;

 



 

(iv) Give written notice to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers):

 



 

(A) when the Shelf Registration Statement or any amendment thereto has been
filed with the SEC;

Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or for additional
information;

 



 

(C) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Shelf Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for
that purpose; and

 



 

(D) of the happening of any event (including due to a Disadvantageous
Condition) that requires Ascent to make changes in the Shelf Registration
Statement or the prospectus in order to correct an untrue statement of a
material fact or include a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances then existing (which notice shall be accompanied by an
instruction to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes
have been made).

 



 

(v) Use its reasonable best efforts to (i) prevent the issuance or obtain the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration
Statement referred to in clause (iv)(C) above at the earliest practicable time
and (ii) timely file all reports, statements and other documents required
under the 1934 Act during the 12-month period beginning on the Closing Date.

 



 

(vi) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by clause (iv)(D) above or
the determination of a Disadvantageous Condition pursuant to _Section
5.22(d)_ (Registration Rights) below, Ascent will, as promptly as practicable
(subject, in the case of a Disadvantageous Condition, to the determination of
the board of directors (or the executive committee) of Ascent that such
Disadvantageous Condition no longer exists), prepare a post-effective
amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or a supplement to the related
prospectus or file any other required document with the SEC under the 1933 Act
so that, as thereafter delivered to the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, the
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If Ascent
notifies the Sellers and the Blocker

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers in accordance with clause (iv)(D) above or _Section 5.22(d)_
(Registration Rights) to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite
changes to the prospectus have been made, then the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers shall suspend use of such prospectus pending receipt of the corrected
prospectus.

 



 

(vii) Use reasonable best efforts to procure the cooperation of Ascents
transfer agent in settling any offering or sale of Registrable Securities,
including with respect to the transfer of physical stock certificates into
book-entry form in accordance with any procedures reasonably requested by the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers.

 



 

(viii) Make available for inspection by the Sellers Representative, at the
offices where normally kept, during reasonable business hours, financial and
other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of Ascent, in each
case reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative in connection with
such Shelf Registration Statement as shall be reasonably necessary to enable
the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers to exercise their due diligence
responsibility; _provided_ , that in no event shall Ascent be required to make
available to any of the Sellers or the Blocker Sellers, or the Sellers
Representative, any information which Ascent believes is competitively
sensitive.

distribution by the sellers thereof set forth or to be set forth in the Shelf
Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

 



 

(x) if requested by the Sellers Representative, promptly incorporate in the

effective amendment if necessary, such information as the Sellers
Representative may reasonably request to have included therein, including,
without limitation, information relating to the plan of distribution;

 



 

(xi) furnish to the Sellers Representative without charge, at least one copy
of the Shelf Registration Statement, as first filed with the SEC, and of each
amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents
incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits (excluding exhibits
incorporated therein by reference);

 



 

(xii) deliver to the Sellers Representative, without charge, as many copies
of the Prospectus (including each preliminary Prospectus) and any amendment or
supplement thereto as the Sellers Representative reasonably may request;
except during a Blackout Period, Ascent hereby consents to the use of the
Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the Sellers and
the Blocker Sellers in connection with the offering and the sale of the Ascent
Shares covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto;

 



 

(xiii) prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, cooperate with
the Sellers Representative and the counsel for the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers in connection with the registration and qualification of the
Registrable Securities under the

 



      
 

 



 

state securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Sellers
Representative may reasonably request and do any and all other acts or things
reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such
jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement; _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that Ascent shall not be required to
register or qualify as a foreign corporation where it is not then so qualified
or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in suits
or to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;

 



 

(xiv) cooperate with the Sellers Representative to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates or book-entry shares representing
Registrable Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and
enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered
in such names as the Sellers Representative may reasonably request at least
two Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities; and

 



 

(xv) during the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, provide
promptly to the Sellers Representative upon written request each document
filed with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 and Section 15
of the 1934 Act after the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement,
unless such document is available through the SECs EDGAR system.

 



 

(d) If the board of directors (or the executive committee) of Ascent shall
determine, in its good faith judgment, that (x) to file the Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section 5.22(a)_ (Registration Rights) or (y) to
permit the continued offer and sale of Registrable Securities under the Shelf
Registration Statement would (i) require the public disclosure of material
non-public information concerning any transaction or negotiations involving
Ascent or any of its Affiliates that would materially interfere with such
transaction or negotiations, or (ii) otherwise require premature disclosure of
material non-public information, in either case that would be significantly
disadvantageous to Ascent or any of its Affiliates (a " _Disadvantageous
Condition_ "), Ascent may, for a reasonable period of time, but not more than
the period that the board of directors (or the executive committee) of Ascent
determines that the Disadvantageous Condition continues to exist, notify the
Sellers Representative in writing that (A) the Shelf Registration Statement
will not be filed on the first Business Day following the conclusion of the
Lock-Up Period or (B) the Shelf Registration Statement is unavailable for use,
as the case may be. Upon receipt of any such notice under clause (B) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall
forthwith discontinue use of the prospectus (or any prospectus supplement)
contained in the Shelf Registration Statement until notified that the
Disadvantageous Condition no longer exists. The total number of days that the
initial filing of the Shelf Registration Statement may be delayed together

the Shelf Registration Statement (once filed) is unavailable for use, a "
_Blackout Period_ ").

 



       
 

 



 

(e) No Seller or Blocker Seller shall use any free writing prospectus (as
defined in Rule 405) in connection with the sale of Registrable Securities
without the prior written consent of Ascent.

 



 

(f) It shall be a condition precedent to Ascents obligation to file the Shelf
Registration Statement or any prospectus supplement with the SEC that the
Sellers Representative shall first furnish to Ascent such information
regarding the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, the Registrable Securities held
by them and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be
required to effect the registered offering of their Registrable Securities
under the 1933 Act.

 



 

(g) The aggregate amount of Registrable Securities that may be sold by the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, collectively, pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement shall not exceed 10,000 Ascent Shares (as adjusted for
stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations, exchange or readjustment of
shares after the date hereof) per Trading Day; _provided_ , _that_ , the
Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, may
effect a total of ten (10) Block Sales. Offers and sales pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement may only be made in open market transactions.

 



 

(h) _Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) Ascent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and Blocker
Seller and each Person, if any, that controls such Seller or such Blocker
Seller within the meaning of the Section 15 of the 1933 Act (each a
"controlling person") and the respective officers, directors, stockholders,
partners, members and Affiliates of each Seller, Blocker Seller and
controlling person (each, a " _Registration Rights Indemnitee_ "), to the
fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all Damages, directly or
indirectly caused by, relating to, arising out of, based upon or in connection
with (i) any untrue statement of material fact contained in the Disclosure
Package, the Shelf Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Free Writing
Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission to
state in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus,
any Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _that_ Ascent shall not be liable to such
Registration Rights Indemnitee to the extent that any such Damage is directly
caused by an untrue statement or omission made in such Disclosure Package,
Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to Ascent by such Registration Rights Indemnitee
and approved expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in
addition to any Liability which Ascent may otherwise have.

 



 

(ii) Each Seller and Blocker Seller agrees, severally and not jointly, to
indemnify Ascent and its officers and directors and each Person, if any, that
controls Ascent (each, an " _Ascent Registration Rights Indemnitee_ "),
against any and all Damages directly caused by any untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Disclosure Package, the Shelf Registration
Statement, the Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus

 



      
 

 



 

or any amendments or supplements thereto or any omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made
not misleading, in each case, to the extent that such untrue statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to Ascent by the Sellers Representative or any Seller or Blocker
Seller and approved expressly for use therein.

 



 

(iii) If the indemnification provided for in _Section 5.22(h)(i)_ or _(ii)_
(Indemnification) is unavailable to a Registration Rights Indemnitee or an
Ascent Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, with respect to any
Damages referred to therein or is insufficient to hold the Registration Rights
Indemnitee or Ascent Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, harmless
as contemplated therein, then Ascent or the Seller(s) or Blocker Seller(s), as
applicable, in lieu of indemnifying such Registration Rights Indemnitee or
Ascent Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Registration Rights Indemnitee or Ascent
Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, as a result of such Damages in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Registration Rights Indemnitee or the Ascent Registration Rights Indemnitee,
as applicable, on the one hand, and Ascent or such Seller(s) or Blocker
Seller(s), as applicable, on the other hand, in connection with the statements
or omissions which resulted in such Damages as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of Ascent or the Seller(s) or
Blocker Seller(s), as applicable, on the one hand, and of the Registration
Rights Indemnitee or Ascent Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, on
the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other factors,
whether the untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by or on behalf of Ascent or by
or on behalf of the Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission; Ascent and each Seller and
Blocker Seller agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this _Section 5.22(h)(iii)_ (Indemnification) were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in _Section 5.22(h)(i)_
(Indemnification). No Registration Rights Indemnitee or Ascent Registration
Rights Indemnitee guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
Ascent or any Seller or Blocker Seller, as applicable, if Ascent or such
Seller or Blocker Seller, as applicable, was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 



 

(i) _Notice of Reg Rights Claim_.

 



 

(i) As used in this _Section 5.22(i)_ (Notice of Reg Rights Claim), the term
" _Reg Rights Claim_ " means a claim for indemnification by any Ascent
Registration Rights Indemnitee or any Registration Rights Indemnitee, as the
case may be, for Damages under _Section 5.22(h)_ (Indemnification) (such
Person making a Reg Rights Claim, an " _Indemnified Person_ "). An Ascent
Registration Rights Indemnitee or a Registration Rights Indemnitee may give
notice of a Reg Rights Claim under this Agreement (and in the case of a
Registration Rights Indemnitee whether for its own Damages or for Damages
incurred by any other Registration Rights Indemnitee) pursuant to a written

 



      
 

 



 

notice of such Reg Rights Claim executed by Ascent or the Sellers
Representative, as applicable (a " _Notice of Reg Rights Claim_ "), and
delivered to the other of them (such receiving party, the " _Indemnifying
Person_ "), within twenty (20) days after such Indemnified Person becomes
aware of the existence of any potential claim by such Indemnified Person for
indemnification under _Section 5.22(h)_ (Indemnification), arising out of or
resulting from any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section
5.22(h)(i)_ or _Section 5.22(h)(ii)_ (Indemnification); _provided_ , that,
the failure to timely give such notice shall not limit or reduce the
Indemnified Persons right to indemnification hereunder unless (and then only
to the extent that) the Indemnifying Persons defense of such Reg Rights Claim
is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(ii) Each Notice of Reg Rights Claim shall: (A) state that the Indemnified
Person has incurred or paid or, in good faith, believes that it is reasonably
likely that it will have to incur or pay, Damages in an aggregate stated
amount (where practicable) arising from such Reg Rights Claim (which amount
may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in an Action brought
against any Indemnified Person based on alleged facts, which if true, would
give rise to liability for Damages to such Indemnified Person under this
_Section 5.22(h)_ (Indemnification), or a good faith estimate, based on the
information available to the Indemnified Person at such time, of Damages that
the Indemnified Person believes that it is reasonably likely that it will have
to incur or pay); and (B) contain a brief description, in reasonable detail
(to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnified Person), of the facts,
circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the
Indemnified Persons good faith belief and knowledge thereof, including the
identity and address of any third party claimant (to the extent reasonably
available to the Indemnified Person).

 



 

(iii) Following delivery of the Notice of Reg Rights Claim (or at the same
time if the Indemnified Person so elects) the Indemnified Person shall deliver
copies of any demand or complaint, the amount of Damages, the date each such
item was incurred or paid, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and
the specific nature of the breach to which such item is related.

 



 

(j) _Defense of Third Party Reg Rights Claims_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnifying Person on behalf of the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to elect to defend and control the
defense of any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim, and, as provided by _Section
5.22(k)_ (Resolution of Claims), the costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Person in connection with such defense (including attorneys
fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs)
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Person. The Indemnified Person (unless
itself controlling the Third-Party Reg Rights Claim in accordance with this
_Section 5.22(j)_ (Defense of Third-Party Reg Rights Claims)) may
participate, through counsel of its own choice and, except as provided herein,
at its own expense, in the defense of any Third Party Reg Rights Claim.

 



 

(ii) The Indemnified Person shall give prompt written notice of any Third-
Party Reg Rights Claim to the Indemnifying Person; _provided_ , that the
failure to timely

 



      
 

 



 

give such notice shall not limit or reduce the Indemnified Persons right to
indemnity hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying
Persons defense of such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim is materially and
adversely prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to
assume the control and defense thereof utilizing legal counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Person; provided, that the Indemnifying Person
shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (A) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the claim
seeks an injunction against the Indemnified Person, to the extent that such
defense relates to the claim for such injunction, or (C) the Indemnifying
Person has elected to have the Indemnified Person defend, or assume the
control and defense of, a Third-Party Reg Rights Claim in accordance with this
_Section 5.22(j)_ (Defense of Third Party Reg Rights Claims).

 



 

(iii) Any party controlling the defense of any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim
pursuant hereto shall: (i) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Reg Rights
Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the other parties reasonably informed
of material developments in the Third-Party Reg Rights Claim at all stages
thereof; (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, submit to the other
parties copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other
similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection therewith;
(iii) permit the other parties and their counsel to confer on the conduct of
the defense thereof; and (iv) permit the other parties and their counsel an
opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted prior to their
submission. Ascent and the Sellers Representative will render to the other
party such assistance as may be reasonably required in order to insure the
proper and adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such records,
information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the other party
in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party shall be required to
disclose any information to the other party or its counsel, accountants or
representatives, if doing so would be reasonably expected to violate any Law
to which such Person is subject or could jeopardize (in the reasonable
discretion of the disclosing party) any attorney-client privilege available
with respect to such information.

 



 

(iv) If the Indemnifying Person controls the defense of and defends any Third-
Party Reg Rights Claim under this _Section 5.22(j)_ (Defense of Third Party
Reg Rights Claims), the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to effect a
settlement of such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim on the Indemnified Persons
behalf without the consent of the Indemnified Person; _provided_ , that (A)
such settlement does not involve any injunctive relief binding upon the
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, and (B) such settlement expressly
and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Person and the other applicable
Indemnified Persons (that is, each of the Ascent Registration Rights
Indemnitees, if the Indemnified Person is an Ascent Registration Rights
Indemnitee, and each of the Registration Rights Indemnitees, if the
Indemnified Person is a Registration Rights Indemnitee) from all Liabilities
with respect to such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim, without prejudice. If the
Indemnified Person controls the defense of and defends any Third-Party Reg
Rights Claim under this _Section 5.22(j)_ (Defense of Third Party Reg Rights
Claims), the Indemnified Person shall have the right to effect a settlement of
such

 



      
 

 



 

Third-Party Reg Rights Claim with the consent of the Indemnifying Person
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No
settlement by the Indemnified Person of such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim
shall limit or reduce the right of any Indemnified Person to indemnity
hereunder for all Damages they may incur arising out of or resulting from the
Third-Party Reg Rights Claim to the extent indemnified in _Section 5.22(h)_
(Indemnification); provided, that such settlement is effected in accordance
with this _Section 5.22(j)_ (Defense of Third Party Reg Rights Claims). As
used in this _Section 5.22_ (Registration Rights), the term "settlement"
refers to any consensual resolution of the claim in question, including by
consent, decree or by permitting any judgment or other resolution of a claim
to occur without disputing the same, and the term "settle" has a corresponding
meaning.

 



 

(k) _Resolution of Claims_. Each Notice of Reg Rights Claim given by an
Indemnified Person shall be resolved as follows:

 



 

(i) _Admitted Claims_. If, within twenty (20) Business Days after a Notice of
Reg Rights Claim is delivered to the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnifying
Person agrees in writing that liability for such Claim is indemnified under
_Section 5.22(h)(i)_ or _Section 5.22(h)(ii)_ (Indemnification), as
applicable, the full amount of the Damages specified in the Notice of Reg
Rights Claim is agreed to, and that such Notice of Reg Rights Claim is timely,
the Indemnifying Person (or the Sellers Representative on behalf of the
Sellers if the Indemnified Person is an Ascent Registration Rights Indemnitee)
shall be conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the
Indemnified Person of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of
Reg Rights Claim, in each case subject to the limitations set forth in Article
IX (Indemnification; Tax Matters), including, if the Indemnified Person is an
Ascent Registration Rights Indemnitee, payment of funds from the Fund
Indemnity equal to such Damages, and Ascent (on behalf of the Ascent
Registration Rights Indemnitees) shall be authorized to deliver such agreement
to the Fund Indemnifying Person instructing the Fund Indemnifying Person to
make a wire transfer to Ascent (on behalf of the Ascent Registration Rights
Indemnitees) in the amount of such Damages; _provided_ , _that_ , to the
extent the full amount of Damages is not known at the time such Notice of Reg
Rights Claim is delivered, payment by the Indemnifying Person under this
_Section 5.22(k)(i)_ (Admitted Claims) with respect to any speculative
Damages shall not be due until the actual amount of such Damages is known.

 



 

(ii) _Contested Reg Rights Claims_. If the Indemnifying Person does not so
agree in writing to such Notice of Reg Rights Claim or gives the Indemnified
Person written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Reg Rights
Claim (a " _Contested Reg Rights Claim_ ") within the twenty (20) Business Day
period specified in _Section 5.22(k)(i)_ (Admitted Claims), then such
Contested Claim shall be resolved by a written settlement agreement executed
by Ascent and the Sellers Representative.

 



 

(l) For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, shall have the right to engage one or more
brokers to effect any sale of the Ascent Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(m) To the extent that the Ascent Shares are tradable without restriction
pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Act, Ascent will cause the removal of any
restrictive legends from the Ascent Shares.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.23** ** ****Lock-Up**

 



 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is ninety (90) days from the date of the Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up
Period_ "), each Seller and each Blocker Seller shall not, directly or
indirectly, (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or
contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any
option, right or warrant for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of or transfer
any Ascent Stock (including the Ascent Shares), or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for Ascent Stock, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired by the undersigned or with respect to which the undersigned
has or hereafter acquires the power of disposition (collectively, the " _Lock-
Up Securities_ "), or exercise any right with respect to the registration of
any of the Lock-Up Securities, or cause to be filed any registration statement
in connection therewith, under the 1933 Act, or (ii) enter into any swap or
any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Lock-Up
Securities, whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery
of Ascent Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.23_ (Lock-Up), (x) the
lock-up set forth herein shall not apply to any sale, tender or other transfer
of Ascent Stock in connection with any merger, exchange or similar transaction
that is approved by the board of directors of Ascent or any tender offer by
any Person and (y) if any other Person subject to a lock-up agreement is
released prior to the expiration thereof in whole or in part from such
agreement at any time during the Lock-Up Period, each of the Sellers and the
Blocker Sellers also shall be proportionally released from the lock-up set
forth herein.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.23(a)_ (Lock-Up), and subject to the
conditions below, the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers may transfer the Lock-Up
Securities, provided that (i) each donee, trustee, distributee, or transferee,
as the case may be agrees to be bound by the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.23_ (Lock-Up), (ii) any such transfer shall not involve a
disposition for value, (iii) such transfers are not required to be reported
with the SEC on Form 4 in accordance with Section 16 of the 1934 Act, and (iv)
each Seller and each Blocker Seller does not otherwise voluntarily effect any
public filing or report regarding such transfers:

 



 

(i) as a _bona fide_ gift or gifts; or

 



 

(ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of any Natural Person
Seller or the immediate family of such Natural Person Seller (for purposes of
this _Section 5.23_ (Lock-Up), "immediate family" shall mean any relationship
by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin); or

 



 

(iii) as a distribution to limited partners or stockholders of such Seller or
Blocker Seller; or

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) to such Seller or Blocker Sellers Affiliates or to any investment fund
or other entity controlled or managed by such Seller or Blocker Seller.

 



 

(c) Each Seller and each Blocker Seller may sell shares of Ascent Stock
purchased by such Seller or Blocker Seller on the open market following the
Closing Date if and only if (i) such sales are not required to be reported in
any public report or filing with the SEC, or otherwise and (ii) such Seller or
Blocker Seller does not otherwise voluntarily effect any public filing or
report regarding such sales.

 



 

(d) Each Seller and each Blocker Seller agrees and consents to the entry of
stop transfer instructions with Ascents transfer agent and registrar against
the transfer of the Lock-Up Securities except in compliance with this _Section
5.23_ (Lock-Up).

 



 

 **SECTION 5.24** ** ****Paul, Weiss and the Oak Hill Legal Department**

 



 

Recognizing that Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP (" _Paul Weiss_
") and the Oak Hill Legal Department (the " _Oak Hill Legal Department_ ")
have acted as legal counsel to the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, and may be
deemed to have acted as legal counsel to the Sold Entities prior to the
Closing, and that Paul Weiss and the Oak Hill Legal Department intend to act
as legal counsel to the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers after the Closing, (a)
Buyer hereby agrees to cause each of the Sold Entities to waive, any conflicts
that may arise in connection with Paul Weiss and the Oak Hill Legal Department
representing the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers after the Closing, (b) the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers agree to cause Paul Weiss and the Oak Hill
Legal Department to put in place the customary screening procedures in
connection with any such representation in order to preserve the privilege of
the Sold Entities, if any, and (c) attorney-client communications between Paul
Weiss or the Oak Hill Legal Department, on the one hand, and any of the
Sellers, the Blocker Sellers or the Sold Entities, on the other hand,
regarding the Transactions shall be property of the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers.

This Agreement and the Transactions may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and the Sellers Representative;

 



 

(b) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers Representative, on the
other hand, if the consummation of this Agreement and the Transactions would
violate any non-appealable final Governmental Order;

 



       
 

 



 

(c) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers Representative, on the
other hand, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the
Termination Date; _provided_ , _that_ , if the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Closing set forth in (i)
_Section 6.2_ (HSR Act) and _Section 7.2_ (HSR Act) are not satisfied on
such date, then the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

hereto, and the Termination Date shall be automatically extended until the
earlier of (x) the date that is three (3) Business Days after the date upon

thirtieth (30th) day following the original Termination Date, or (ii)
_Section 6.1_ (Governmental or Legal Action) and _Section 7.1_ (Governmental
or Legal Action) are not satisfied on such date, then, either Buyer, on the
one hand, or the Sellers Representative, on the other hand, may elect to
extend the Termination Date until the earlier of (x) the date that is three
(3) Business Days after the date upon which the applicable Governmental Order
is lifted or pending Action is finally resolved such that it does not prohibit

together as one party for such purpose and, in the case of Buyer, shall mean
Buyer and Ascent taken together as one party for such purpose) whose breach of
its representations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur by the
Termination Date;

 



 

(d) by the Sellers Representative, if Buyer or Ascent breaches its
representations or warranties or defaults in the performance of its covenants
or other obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach or default
would prevent any condition precedent to the obligations of the Sellers in
_Article VII_ (Conditions Precedent to Obligations of the Sellers and the
Blocker Sellers) from being satisfied, and such breach or default is not cured
prior to the Termination Date (the " _Cure Period_ "), as long as any Seller
or any Blocker Seller is not in breach or default in any material respect of

hand, if all the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_ (Conditions
Precedent to Obligations of Buyer) (other than the condition set forth in

Blocker Sellers are ready, willing and able to deliver the certificates
contemplated by _Sections 6.3_ (Accuracy of Representations and Warranties)
and _6.4_ (Performance of Agreements) (and notice of same has been provided to
Buyer)) (or are capable of being satisfied contemporaneously with the Closing)
on the

 



      
 

 



 

Termination Date, but proceeds of the Financing contemplated by _Section 6.7_
(Financing) are not available to Buyer on or prior to the Termination Date;
and

 



 

(f) by Buyer, if any Seller or any Blocker Seller breaches its representations
or warranties or defaults in the performance of its covenants or other
obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach or default would prevent
any condition precedent to the obligations of Buyer in _Article VI_
(Conditions Precedent to Obligations of Buyer) from being satisfied, and such
breach or default is not cured within the Cure Period, as long as Buyer or
Ascent is not in breach or default in any material respect of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement,
which breach or default would prevent any condition to the obligations of the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers in _Article VII_ (Conditions Precedent to
Obligations of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers) from being satisfied.

 



 

For all purposes of this Agreement, (i) the breach of any covenant or
agreement by a Sold Entity hereunder prior to the Closing shall be treated as
the breach of a covenant or agreement by the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers,
(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by a Sold Entity hereunder
following the Closing shall be treated as a breach of a covenant or agreement
by the Buyer, (iii) it is accepted and agreed that each of the Buyer and
Ascent shall not be deemed to be in breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth herein solely as a result of the failure of
the condition set forth in _Section 6.7_ (Financing) and (iv) any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Fund Indemnitor under
_Section 9.9(e)_ (Fund Indemnity) shall be treated as a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers, taken together.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.2** ** ****Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination; Reverse
Termination Fee**

 



 

(a) _Notice of Termination_. The party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ (Events of Termination) shall give written notice
of such termination to the other parties in accordance with _Section 10.1_
(Notices), specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination
is effected. To the extent Buyer provides a notice of termination under
_Section 8.1(c)_ (Events of Termination), it will be a condition to such
termination that Buyer concurrently provide evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Sellers Representative that the condition set forth in _Section 6.7_
(Financing) was capable of being satisfied at the Closing had the Closing
occurred on the Termination Date.

 



 

(b) _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ (Events of Termination), this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto, except that
(i) the provisions of this _Section 8.2_ (Notice of Termination; Effect of
Termination; Reverse Termination Fee) and _Article X_ (General Provisions)
shall survive the termination hereof and (ii) nothing contained herein shall
relieve any party from Liability for fraud, intentional misconduct or willful
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Reverse Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_
(Events of Termination) or _Section 8.1(e)_ (Events of Termination) (a "
_Qualifying Termination Event_ "), Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers)
by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days
following such termination, a fee in the amount of $45,000,000 (the " _Reverse
Termination Fee_ ").

 



 

(ii) Ascent (as primary obligor and not as surety only) irrevocably,
absolutely and unconditionally promises to pay or cause Buyer to pay to the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, the amounts that Buyer is obligated to pay
pursuant to _Sections 2.3(d)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR),
_2.3(e)(ii)_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR), _2.3(f)(ii)_ (Working
Capital; Closing Date RMR) and/or, on the terms and subject to the conditions
of this _Section 8.2(c)_ (Reverse Termination Fee), the amounts that Buyer is
obligated to pay pursuant to this _Section 8.2(c)_ (Reverse Termination Fee).
Ascent hereby waives all claims of waiver, release, surrender, abstraction or
compromise and all set-offs, counterclaims, cross-claims, recoupments or other
defenses that it may have against any Seller or Blocker Seller except for any
defense available to Buyer that is provided for in this Agreement. Ascent
agrees to pay the reasonable costs and expenses of the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers in connection with the successful enforcement by the Sellers
Representative of its rights under this _Section 8.2(c)_ (Reverse Termination
Fee). The obligations of Ascent hereunder are unconditional and irrevocable
and will not be discharged by: (i) any modification of, or amendment or
supplement to, this Agreement; (ii) any furnishing or acceptance of security
or any exchange or release of any security; (iii) any waiver, consent or other
action or inaction or any exercise or non-exercise of any right, remedy or
power with respect to Buyer; or (iv) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, composition, liquidation, dissolution, or similar
proceedings with respect to Buyer. Ascents obligations hereunder shall be
binding upon Ascent, its successors and assigns and inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers
and the Blocker Sellers).

 



 

(iii) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any amount payable
pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ (Reverse Termination Fee) does not constitute
a penalty but shall constitute liquidated damages to compensate the Sellers
and the Blocker Sellers. Payment of the Reverse Termination Fee (together with
the reasonable costs and expenses of the Sellers Representative in connection
with the successful enforcement by the Sellers Representative of its rights
under this _Section 8.2(c)_ (Reverse Termination Fee)) shall be the Sellers
and the Blocker Sellers sole and exclusive remedy against Buyer and Ascent as
a result of a Qualifying Termination Event.

 



 

(iv) Upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee as set forth in _Section
8.2(c)(i)_ (Reverse Termination Fee) (together with the reasonable costs and
expenses of the Sellers Representative in connection with the successful
enforcement by the Sellers Representative of its rights under this _Section
8.2(c)_ (Reverse Termination Fee)), each of Buyer and Ascent shall have no
further liability to any Seller or any

 



      
 

 



 

Blocker Seller or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise, except for
liability arising out of fraud.

 **INDEMNIFICATION; TAX MATTERS**

 



 

 **SECTION 9.1** ** ****Indemnification of Buyer**

 



 

(a) The Sellers and the Blocker Sellers agree that, after the Closing Date,
Buyer, the Sold Entities, and their respective Affiliates (each, a " _Buyer
Indemnified Person_ ") shall, to the extent provided in this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters), be indemnified and held harmless from and
against, any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of actions,
losses, costs, damages, liabilities, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred or
paid, including reasonable attorneys fees, costs of investigation or
settlement, other professionals and experts fees, court or arbitration
costs, but specifically excluding consequential damages, lost profits,
indirect damages, punitive damages, exemplary damages and any Taxes incurred
as a result of any recovery received under this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters) (any and all such amounts subject to
indemnification hereunder, being hereinafter collectively referred to as "
_Damages_ "),

 



 

(i) to the extent such Damages arise out of or result from:

 



 

(A) any inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations or warranties given
or made by any Seller or any Blocker Seller in this Agreement, as qualified by
the Schedules hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty in _Section 3.14(h)_
(Taxes), the Damages shall be determined in accordance with the principles set
forth in _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes) and limited to the amount
payable pursuant thereto, or

 



 

(B) without duplication, any breach of any covenant or obligations of any
Seller or any Blocker Seller set forth in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) without duplication, to the extent provided in _Section 9.8_ (Tax
Indemnification) and _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes) (but only to the
extent not covered by _Section 9.1(a)(i)(A)_ (Indemnification of Buyer));

 



 

 _provided_ , that Damages shall also include amounts awarded to a third party
in a Third-Party Claim as consequential damages, lost profits, indirect
damages, punitive damages or exemplary damages (as the case may be). Except as
set forth in _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ and _9.1(b)_ (Indemnification of Buyer)
below, all indemnification payments pursuant to _Sections 9.1(a)(i)_ and
_(ii)_ (Indemnification of Buyer) hereof shall be paid solely from the Fund
Indemnity;

 



 

(iii) to the extent that amounts payable by the Fund Indemnitor are not
available (whether by reason of breach, depletion of funds or otherwise), each
Oak Hill

 



      
 

 



 

Entity and each Blocker Seller, jointly and severally with respect to the
obligations of the Oak Hill Entities and the Blocker Sellers hereunder, and
each of the Natural Person Sellers, the Perry Companies, PCP and BNY,
severally (based on such Persons Transaction Percentage) and not jointly,
shall be liable and obligated to pay the Buyer Indemnified Persons all amounts
required to be paid pursuant to this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax
Matters) or by reason of fraud, which amounts shall not be limited other than
as described in _Section 9.1(b)_ (Indemnification of Buyer); _provided_ ,
_that_ , that no Seller shall be liable for Damages in excess of the portion
of the Purchase Price received by it, except that the Oak Hill Entities and
the Blocker Sellers shall be collectively liable for Damages up to the
aggregate amount of the Purchase Price received by all of the Oak Hill
Entities and the Blocker Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
the fact that neither PCP nor BNY make any representations and warranties with
respect to the business or operations of the Sold Entities under _Article
III_, each of PCP and BNY shall have several (but not joint) liability (based
on their respective Transaction Percentages) with respect to all amounts
required to be paid (including those relating to Damages arising out of
breaches of any such representations and warranties) to the Buyer Indemnified
Persons pursuant to this _Article IX_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.1_
(Indemnification of Buyer), (i) the indemnification provided for in _Section
9.1(a)(i)_ (Indemnification of Buyer) shall not apply unless and until the
aggregate Damages determined to be due for which the Buyer Indemnified Persons
seek or have sought indemnification hereunder exceeds a cumulative aggregate
amount equal to $5,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other limitations herein, be
indemnified for all Damages in excess of the Deductible and (ii) the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall not assert or be entitled to recover from the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, in the aggregate, an amount more than the Cap
for any and all claims for indemnity in respect of Damages arising under
_Section 9.1(a)(i)_ (Indemnification of Buyer); _provided_ , _however_ ,
_that_ , neither the Deductible nor the Cap shall apply with respect to any
Damages arising out of or based upon any (x) breach of any of the
representations or warranties contained in _Sections 3.1_ (Organization and
Qualification; Subsidiaries), _3.2_ (Authority), _3.4_ (Brokers), _3.8_
(Capitalization of the Seller Sold Entities), _3.9_ (No Operations), _3.10(d)_
(Seller Sold Entity Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Company Liabilities;
Indebtedness), _3.11(c)_ (Blocker Financial Statements; Blocker
Indebtedness), _3.14_ (Taxes), and _3.28_ (Expenses), (collectively, the "
_Fundamental Reps_ "), or (y) breach of any covenant set forth in _5.4(a)_ ,
_5.4(b)_ , _5.4(c)_ , _5.4(d)_ , _5.4(g)_ , _5.4(h)_ , _5.4(k)_ , _5.4(p)_ ,
(Operation of Business  Negative Covenants), _5.14(a)_ (Labor and Employment
Matters; WARN), _5.16_ (Target Options), _5.22(h)(ii)_ (Registration Rights),
_9.9_ (Fund Indemnity) ( _provided_ , that Damages with respect to _Section
9.9_ (Fund Indemnity) shall exceed the Cap only to the extent that such excess
relates to the costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer (on behalf of any
Buyer Indemnified Person) in connection with the successful enforcement of the
Fund Indemnity), _9.11(a)_ (Seller Tax Returns), or _9.11(c)_ (Amended
Returns); _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ , (I) the Cap (but not the
Deductible) shall apply with respect to any Damages arising out of or based
upon any breach of any covenant set forth in _Section 5.11_ (Instruments) and
_5.23_ (Lock-Up) and (II) the aggregate amount of all Damages recoverable
against (x) any Seller (other than the Oak Hill Entities and the Blocker
Sellers) hereunder shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price received
by

 



      
 

 



 

such Seller and (y) the Oak Hill Entities and the Blocker Sellers collectively
hereunder shall not exceed the aggregate portion of the Purchase Price
received by such Persons in the aggregate.

 



 

(c) The amount to which the Buyer Indemnified Persons may become entitled
under this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) shall be (x) _less_
any actual recovery (which shall not include any Tax benefit, credit or refund
received or realized by the Buyer Indemnified Persons or to which the Buyer
Indemnified Persons may be entitled) received from any third parties
(including any insurer) and (y) _plus_ any out-of-pocket cost associated with
receiving such recovery in respect of a claim.

 



 

(d) For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages under this _Article IX
_(Indemnification; Tax Matters), but not for purposes of determining whether a
breach has occurred, the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been made without any qualifications as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications (other than in
clause (x) of _Section 3.1_ (Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries),
clause (y) of _Section 3.6_ (Absence of Litigation), and _Section 3.12_
(Absence of Certain Changes or Events) (Material Adverse Effect reference
only)).

 



 

(e) Each Buyer Indemnified Person shall use its reasonable best efforts to
mitigate any Damages which form the basis of an indemnification claim
hereunder; _provided_ , _that_ , the failure of each Buyer Indemnified Person
to mitigate such Damages shall not relieve Sellers, the Blocker Sellers or the
Fund Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement except
to the extent that the applicable of the Sellers, the Blocker Sellers or the
Fund Indemnitor is materially and adversely prejudiced as a result of such
failure to mitigate.

 



 

(f) None of the Sellers, the Blocker Sellers or the Fund Indemnitor shall be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to (i) any
representation, warranty, covenant or condition with respect to which the
Buyer has specifically waived in writing the Buyer Indemnified Persons rights
to indemnification under this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) on
or prior to the Closing, (ii) any Damages with respect to any matter if such
matter was included in the calculation of the adjustment to the Estimated
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR)
or (iii) any Damages for which a Notice of Claim was not duly delivered prior
to the expiration of the survival period applicable to the breach to which the
claim for Damages relates.

 



 

(g) No Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) with respect to any (i)
claim of a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this
Agreement of which Buyer had actual knowledge prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) any Damages arising or resulting from any breach by Buyer, any
of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives of the covenants and
agreements set forth in _Section 5.12_ (Dealer Communication) and/or (iii)
the Specified Litigation, including the settlement or defense thereof (
_provided_ that the Sellers, the Blocker Sellers and the Sold Entities are in

 



      
 

 



 

compliance in all material respects with their obligations set forth in
_Section 5.4(k)_ (Specified Litigation Covenant)). For the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any claims made by a Buyer Indemnified Person, actual
knowledge shall be the actual knowledge of William Fitzgerald, William Niles,
John Orr, Michael Haislip and Michael Meyers.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.2** ** ****Indemnification of the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers**

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that, after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Seller, each Blocker Seller and their respective
Affiliates (each a " _Seller Indemnified Person_ ") from and against any and
all Damages (i) arising out of or resulting from (A) any inaccuracy or breach
of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or Ascent in this Agreement,
(B) any breach by Buyer or Ascent of any covenant or obligation set forth in
this Agreement or (C) fraud or (ii) to the extent provided in _Section 9.8_
(Tax Indemnification).

 



 

(b) The amount to which a Seller Indemnified Person may become entitled under
this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) shall be (x) _less_ any
actual recovery (which shall not include any Tax benefit, credit or refund
received or realized by any Seller Indemnified Person or to which any Seller
Indemnified Person may be entitled) received from a third party (including any
insurer) and (y) _plus_ any out-of-pocket cost associated with receiving such
recovery in respect of a claim.

 



 

(c) Each Seller Indemnified Person shall use its reasonable best efforts to
mitigate any Damages which form the basis of an indemnification claim
hereunder; _provided_ , _that_ , the failure of each Seller Indemnified Person
to mitigate such Damages shall not relieve Buyer of its indemnification
obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that Buyer is materially
and adversely prejudiced as a result of such failure to mitigate.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall not be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons
with respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition with
respect to which Seller has specifically waived in writing the Seller
Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification under this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters) on or prior to the Closing, (ii) any Damages
with respect to any matter if such matter was included in the calculation of
the adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3_
(Working Capital; Closing Date RMR) or (iii) any Damages for which a Notice of
Claim was not duly delivered prior to the expiration of the survival period
applicable to the breach to which the claim for Damages relates.

 



 

(e) No Seller Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) with respect to any claim
of a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement
of which any Seller Indemnified Person had actual knowledge prior to the date
of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any claims made
by a Seller Indemnified Person, actual knowledge shall be the actual knowledge
of the individuals listed in the definition of Knowledge of the Sellers and
the Blocker Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 9.3** ** ****Notice of Claim**

 



 

(a) As used in this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters), the term "
_Claim_ " means a claim for indemnification by any Buyer Indemnified Person or
any Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be, for Damages under this
_Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) (such Person making a Claim, an "
_Indemnitee_ "). A Buyer Indemnified Person or a Seller Indemnified Person may
give notice of a Claim under this Agreement (and in the case of a Seller
Indemnified Person whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by any
other Seller Indemnified Person) pursuant to a written notice of such Claim
executed by Buyer or the Sellers Representative, as applicable (a " _Notice
of Claim_ "), and delivered to the other of them (such receiving party, the "
_Indemnitor_ "), within twenty (20) days after such Indemnitee becomes aware
of the existence of any potential claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification
under this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters), arising out of or
resulting from:

 



 

(i) any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Sections 9.1_
(Indemnification of Buyer) or _9.2_ (Indemnification of the Sellers and the
Blocker Sellers); or

 



 

(ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnitee of a
claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding
brought by a third party against any Indemnitee (in each such case, a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") that arises out of or results from any item indemnified
pursuant to the terms of _Sections 9.1_ (Indemnification of Buyer) or _9.2_
(Indemnification of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers);

 



 

 _provided_ , _that_ , the failure to timely give such notice shall not limit
or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnification hereunder unless (and then
only to the extent that) the Indemnitors defense of such Claim is materially
and adversely prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) Each Notice of Claim shall:

 



 

(i) state that the Indemnitee has incurred or paid or, in good faith, believes
that it is reasonably likely that it will have to incur or pay, Damages in an
aggregate stated amount (where practicable) arising from such Claim (which
amount may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in an action
brought against any Indemnitee based on alleged facts, which if true, would
give rise to liability for Damages to such Indemnitee under this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters), or a good faith estimate, based on the
information available to the Indemnitee at such time, of Damages that the
Indemnitee believes that it is reasonably likely that it will have to incur or
pay); and

 



 

(ii) contain a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent
reasonably available to the Indemnitee), of the facts, circumstances or events
giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the Indemnitees good faith belief
and knowledge thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party
claimant (to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnitee).

 



      
 

 



 

Following delivery of the Notice of Claim (or at the same time if the
Indemnitee so elects) the Indemnitee shall deliver copies of any demand or
complaint, the amount of Damages, the date each such item was incurred or
paid, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the specific nature of
the breach to which such item is related.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.4** ** ****Defense of Third-Party Claims**

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the
Indemnitee shall have the right to elect to defend and control the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, and, as provided by _Section 9.5_ (Resolution of
Notice of Claim), the costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in
connection with such defense (including attorneys fees, other professionals
and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be paid by the
Indemnitor. At any time the Sellers Representative may elect to have Buyer
defend, or assume control of the defense of, any Third-Party Claim against
Buyer, in which case Buyer shall have available to it the Fund Indemnity to
fund its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, and Buyer and the
Sellers Representative shall from time to time execute and deliver joint
written instructions to the Fund Indemnitor directing disbursements from the
Fund Indemnity for such purpose. The Indemnitee (unless itself controlling the
Third-Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 9.4(a)_ (Defense of Third-
Party Claims)) may participate, through counsel of its own choice and, except
as provided herein, at its own expense, in the defense of any Third-Party
Claim.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 9.12_ (Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation), the
Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim to the
Indemnitor; _provided_ , that the failure to timely give such notice shall not
limit or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnity hereunder unless (and then
only to the extent that) the Indemnitors defense of such Third-Party Claim is
materially and adversely prejudiced thereby. The Indemnitor shall be entitled
to assume the control and defense thereof utilizing legal counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be
entitled to assume control of such defense if (A) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the claim
seeks an injunction against the Indemnitee, to the extent that such defense
relates to the claim for such injunction, or (C) the Indemnitor has elected to
have the Indemnitee defend, or assume the control and defense of, a Third-
Party Claim in accordance with _Section 9.4(a)_ (Defense of Third-Party
Claims).

 



 

(c) Any party controlling the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant hereto
shall: (i) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable
diligence and keep the other parties reasonably informed of material
developments in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (ii) as promptly
as reasonably practicable, submit to the other parties copies of all
pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other similar legal documents and
papers received or filed in connection therewith; (iii) permit the other
parties and their counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof; and
(iv) permit the other parties and their counsel an opportunity to review all
legal papers to be submitted prior to their submission. Buyer and the Sellers
Representative will render to the other party such assistance as may be
reasonably required in order to insure the

 



      
 

 



 

proper and adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such records,
information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the other party
in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party shall be required to
disclose any information to the other party or its counsel, accountants or
representatives, if doing so would be reasonably expected to violate any Law
to which such Person is subject or could jeopardize (in the reasonable
discretion of the disclosing party) any attorney-client privilege available
with respect to such information.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnitor controls the defense of and defends any Third-Party
Claim under this _Section 9.4_ (Defense of Third-Party Claims), the
Indemnitor shall have the right to effect a settlement of such Third-Party
Claim on the Indemnitees behalf without the consent of the Indemnitee;
_provided_ , that (A) such settlement does not involve any injunctive relief
binding upon the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, and (B) such settlement
expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee and the other applicable
Indemnified Persons (that is, each of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, if the
Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person, and each of the Seller Indemnified
Persons, if the Indemnitee is a Seller Indemnified Person) from all
Liabilities with respect to such Third-Party Claim, without prejudice. If the
Indemnitee controls the defense of and defends any Third-Party Claim under
this _Section 9.4_ (Defense of Third-Party Claims), the Indemnitee shall have
the right to effect a settlement of such Third-Party Claim with the consent of
the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). No settlement by the Indemnitee of such Third-Party Claim shall
limit or reduce the right of any Indemnitee to indemnity hereunder for all
Damages they may incur arising out of or resulting from the Third-Party Claim
to the extent indemnified in this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters)
(including the limitations set forth in herein); _provided_ , that such
settlement is effected in accordance with this _Article IX_ (Indemnification;
Tax Matters). As used in this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters),
the term "settlement" refers to any consensual resolution of the claim in
question, including by consent, decree or by permitting any judgment or other
resolution of a claim to occur without disputing the same, and the term
"settle" has a corresponding meaning.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.5** ** ****Resolution of Notice of Claim**

 



 

Each Notice of Claim given by an Indemnitee shall be resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) _Admitted Claims_. If, within twenty (20) Business Days after a Notice of
Claim is delivered to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor agrees in writing that
liability for such Claim is indemnified under _Section 9.1_ (Indemnification
of Buyer) or _Section 9.2_ (Indemnification of Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers), as applicable, the full amount of the Damages specified in the
Notice of Claim is agreed to, and that such Notice of Claim is timely, the
Indemnitor (or the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers if the
Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person) shall be conclusively deemed to have
consented to the recovery by the Indemnitee of the full amount of Damages
specified in the Notice of Claim, in each case subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article IX_

 



       
 

 



 

(Indemnification; Tax Matters), including, if the Indemnitee is a Buyer
Indemnified Person, payment of funds from the Fund Indemnity equal to such
Damages, and Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Persons) shall be
authorized to deliver such agreement to the Fund Indemnitor instructing the
Fund Indemnitor to make a wire transfer to Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons) in the amount of such Damages; _provided_ , _that_ , to
the extent the full amount of Damages is not known at the time such Notice of
Claim is delivered (such as in the case of a Third-Party Claim which is
subject to an unresolved dispute between the claimant and the Indemnitee, with
respect to amounts claimed by the claimant), payment by the Indemnitor under
this _Section 9.5(a)_ (Admitted Claims) with respect to any speculative
Damages shall not be due until the actual amount of such Damages is known.

 



 

(b) _Contested Claims_. If the Indemnitor does not so agree in writing to such
Notice of Claim or gives the Indemnitee written notice contesting all or any
portion of a Notice of Claim (a " _Contested Claim_ ") within the twenty (20)
Business Day period specified in _Section 9.5(a)_ (Admitted Claims), then
such Contested Claim shall be resolved by a written settlement agreement
executed by Buyer and the Sellers Representative.

 



 

(c) _Payment to Buyer_. If a Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to the
recovery of Damages pursuant to any Claim that is agreed to pursuant to
_Section 9.5(a)_ (Admitted Claims), Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified
Persons) shall be entitled under the terms of _Section 9.9_ (Fund Indemnity)
to receive from the Fund Indemnity the amount of Damages arising out of or
resulting from such Claim as so determined pursuant to this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters) (or, if less, the entire Fund Indemnity) in
accordance with _Section 9.9_ (Fund Indemnity) of this Agreement. To the
extent that amounts payable by the Fund Indemnitor are not available (whether
by reason of breach, depletion of funds or otherwise), Buyer (on behalf of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons) shall be entitled to seek such shortfall from the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_
(Indemnification of Buyer), in each case subject to all applicable limitations
to such recovery set forth in this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax
Matters).

Representative in its sole discretion, (iv) the registration rights pursuant
to _Section 5.22_ (Registration Rights), and (v) the taking by the Sellers
Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required
or permitted to be taken by or on behalf of any Seller and any Blocker Seller
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the
power to: (A) authorize the release or delivery to Buyer of all or any portion
of (x) the Escrow Funds in satisfaction of the obligations (if any) with
respect to the post-Closing adjustments contemplated by _Sections 2.3_
(Working Capital; Closing Date RMR) and _2.4_ (Payment;

 



      
 

 



 

Escrow; Payment Procedures) and (y) the Fund Indemnity in satisfaction of the
obligations (if any) with respect to indemnification claims by Buyer pursuant
to this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters); (B) agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with Orders of courts
with respect to, such indemnification claims; (C) litigate, resolve, settle or
compromise any claim for indemnification made pursuant to this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters); (D) take any action that may be necessary or
desirable, as determined by the Sellers Representative, in its sole
discretion, in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article VIII_ (Termination); (E) accept notices on behalf of the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers in accordance with _Section 10.1_ (Notices);
and (F) take all actions necessary in the judgment of the Sellers
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Sellers
Representative shall have no authority or power to act on behalf of the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers except as expressly provided in this
Agreement. The Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall be bound by all actions
taken and documents executed by the Sellers Representative hereunder,
including in connection with _Sections 2.3_ (Working Capital; Closing Date
RMR) and _2.4_ (Payment; Escrow; Payment Procedures) and this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters), and Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any
action or decision of the Sellers Representative. In performing the functions
specified in this Agreement, the Sellers Representative may act upon any
instrument or other writing believed by the Sellers Representative in good
faith to be genuine and to be signed or presented by the proper Person.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers Representative
shall have full power and authority to interpret all the terms and provisions
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to consent to any amendment
hereof or thereof (solely to the extent such amendment (I) does not treat any
Seller or Blocker Seller different than any other Seller or Blocker Seller,
(II) is consistent with this Agreement, (III) does not increase (1) the pro
rata indemnification obligations of any Seller or Blocker Seller, (2) the Cap,
and (3) the limitations that PCPs or BNYs indemnification obligations
hereunder shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price received by such
Seller hereunder, and (IV) does not provide for any amendments or other
modifications to the representations, warranties or covenants of the Sellers
or Blocker Sellers in a manner that adversely affects any Seller or Blocker
Seller), on behalf of all the Sellers and their respective heirs, successors
and assigns. Upon the request of any Seller or any Blocker Seller, the
Sellers Representative shall keep such Seller or such Blocker Seller
reasonably informed as to the status of any actions being taken by the
Sellers Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each Seller and each Blocker Seller hereby appoints and constitutes the
Sellers Representative the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of such Seller
and such Blocker Seller, with full power in their name and on their behalf to
act according to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and in
general to do all things and to perform all acts including executing and
delivering the Escrow Agreement any other agreements, certificates, receipts,
instructions, notices or instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in
connection with the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ , the foregoing
shall not entitle the Sellers Representative to execute any non-solicitation,
non-competition or similar restrictive covenant on behalf of any Seller or any
Blocker Seller without the consent of such Seller or such Blocker Seller. This
power of attorney and all authority

 



      
 

 



 

hereby conferred is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be
terminated by any act of any Seller or any Blocker Seller, by operation of
law, whether by such persons death, disability, protective supervision or any
other event. Without limiting the foregoing, this power of attorney is to
ensure the performance of a special obligation and, accordingly, each Seller
and each Blocker Seller shall be deemed to have waived and renounced its, his
or her right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally any time before
the expiration of the longest survival period provided by _Section 9.6_
(Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties) (as the same may be
extended until any applicable Claim has been fully and finally resolved).
Subject to _Section 9.7(d)_, Each Seller and each Blocker Seller shall be
deemed to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Sellers Representative taken in good
faith under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the power
of attorney granted in this _Section 9.7_ (Appointment of Sellers
Representative), no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or
document shall be ineffective as to any Seller or any Blocker Seller solely by
reason of such Seller or such Blocker Seller (instead of the Sellers
Representative) having signed or given the same directly.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Ascent will issue and deliver the Ascent Shares to the
Sellers Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers). The Sellers Representative shall hold the Ascent Shares for the
benefit of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Sellers Representative shall hold such Ascent Shares merely for
convenience and ease of administration, but the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers (pro rata based on the percentage of the Purchase Price paid to the
Sellers and the Blocker Sellers at the Closing) shall be the owners of such
Ascent Shares. Subject to the lock-up provisions set forth in _Section 5.23_
(Lock-Up), the Sellers Representative shall have the right, at any time and
from time to time, to sell such number of Ascent Shares as it shall determine
and the proceeds from each such sale shall be distributed to the Sellers and
the Blocker Sellers on a pro rata basis (based on the percentage of the
Purchase Price paid to the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers at the Closing).
Each Seller and Blocker Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the
Sellers Representative shall use its reasonable judgment with respect to the
timing and manner of disposition of the Ascent Shares and the Sellers
Representative does not guarantee any outcome with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) Except for fraud on its part, willful misconduct on its part or a breach
of this Agreement or the Seller-Blocker Agreement by the Sellers
Representative, the Sellers Representative shall have no Liability to any
other Seller or any Blocker Seller under this Agreement, the Seller-Blocker
Seller Agreement or any other documents related to the Transactions for any
action or omission by the Sellers Representative on behalf of the other
Sellers and/or the Blocker Sellers.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.8** ** ****Tax Indemnification**

 



 

(a) _Seller and Blocker Seller Tax Indemnification_. Each Oak Hill Entity and
each Blocker Seller, jointly and severally, and each of the Natural Person
Sellers, the Perry Companies, PCP and BNY, severally and not jointly, shall
indemnify the Sold Entities, Buyer and their respective Affiliates, and hold
them harmless from and against, without duplication, (i) any and all Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) of the Sold Entities for

 



      
 

 



 

any Pre-Closing Tax Period (consistent with the principles of _Section 9.10_
(Straddle Period)) in excess of the amount of Taxes which are included as
current liabilities in Closing Working Capital, (ii) any and all Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any
of the Sold Entities (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
non-U.S. Law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than
the Sold Entities) imposed on the Sold Entities as a transferee or successor,
by contract or pursuant to any Law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to
an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, (iv) any and all
Transfer Taxes required to be borne by the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers
pursuant to _Section 9.13_ (Certain Taxes and Fees); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Sellers and Blocker Sellers shall not be responsible for, and shall
have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless the Sold Entities, Buyer and
their respective Affiliates for, any Taxes arising out of a breach by Buyer of
any of its covenants or obligations in this Agreement or any Tax loss
attributable to any action taken on the Closing Date after the Closing by any
Sold Entity, the Buyer or any of their Affiliates (other than any such action
expressly required by applicable law or by this agreement).

 



 

(b) _Buyer Tax Indemnification_. The Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers,
Blocker Sellers and their Affiliates against, and hold them harmless from and
against, without duplication, (i) any and all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of the Sold Entities for any Post-Closing Tax Period (consistent with
the principles of _Section 9.10_ (Straddle Period)), and (ii) any and all
Transfer Taxes required to be borne by the Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.13_
(Certain Taxes and Fees); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be
responsible for, and shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless
Sellers, Blocker Sellers and their Affiliates for, any Taxes arising out of a
breach by any Seller or Blocker Seller of (x) any of its representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.14_ (Taxes), or (y) any of its covenants
or obligations in this Agreement.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.9** ** ****Fund Indemnity**

 



 

(a) The Fund Indemnitor (as primary obligor and not as surety only)
irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally promises to pay to Buyer, on the
terms and subject to the conditions of this _Section 9.9_ (this " _Fund
Indemnity_ ") all Damages which shall be due and owing by the Sellers and the
Blocker Sellers to Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Persons) in
respect of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers obligations under this
_Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) or in respect of fraud
(collectively the " _Fund Indemnity Obligations_ ") strictly in accordance
with the terms hereof but in no event to exceed an aggregate amount of
$25,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

 



 

(b) The Fund Indemnitor hereby waives all claims of waiver, release,
surrender, abstraction or compromise and all set-offs, counterclaims, cross-
claims, recoupments or other defenses that it may have against any Buyer
Indemnified Person except for any defense available to any Seller or Blocker
Seller that is provided for in this Agreement. The Fund Indemnitor agrees to
pay the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer (on behalf of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons) in connection with the successful

 



      
 

 



 

enforcement of this Fund Indemnity from and after the final determination that
Damages are due and owed by the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers to the Buyer
Indemnified Persons in respect of the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers
obligations under this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) or as a
result of fraud. The Fund Indemnitor agrees to pay the reasonable costs and
expenses of the Buyer Indemnified Persons in connection with the successful
enforcement by Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Persons) of their
rights under this _Section 9.9_ (Fund Indemnity).

 



 

(c) The obligations of the Fund Indemnitor hereunder are unconditional and
irrevocable and will not be discharged by: (i) any modification of, or
amendment or supplement to, this Agreement; (ii) any furnishing or acceptance
of security or any exchange or release of any security; (iii) any waiver,
consent or other action or inaction or any exercise or non-exercise of any
right, remedy or power with respect to any Seller or Blocker Seller or any
change in the structure of any Seller or Blocker Seller; or (iv) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, composition, liquidation,
dissolution, or similar proceedings with respect to any Seller or Blocker
Seller.

 



 

(d) This Fund Indemnity shall be binding upon the Fund Indemnitor, its
successors and assigns and inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
Buyer and its successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

(e) The Fund Indemnitor represents and warrants to each Buyer Indemnified
Person as follows: the Transactions contemplated hereby, including the Fund
Indemnity, do not conflict in any respect with any of the provisions of such
organizational documents; and the provisions of this _Section 9.9_ (Fund
Indemnity) constitute a binding obligation of the Fund Indemnitor, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and
by the application of general principles of equity.

 



 

(f) Each Buyer Indemnified Person agrees that that the Fund Indemnitor shall
not have any obligation or liability to any Person relating to, arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement other than as expressly set forth in this
_Section 9.9_ (Fund Indemnity). Except as contemplated by _Section 9.1(c)_
(Indemnification of Buyer), with respect to any costs and expenses incurred by
the Buyer (on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Person) in connection with the
successful enforcement of the Fund Indemnity, the Fund Indemnity Obligations
shall in no event exceed the Cap.

 



 

(g) Each Buyer Indemnified Person acknowledges that in the event it has any
unsatisfied Fund Indemnity Obligations, payment of such Fund Indemnity
Obligations by the Fund Indemnitor (or by any other Person on behalf of the
Fund Indemnitor) shall constitute satisfaction in full of the Fund
Indemnitors obligations with respect thereto and the Sellers and Blocker
Sellers shall be relieved of all liability under the Agreement in connection
therewith.

 



 

(h) OHCP III agrees to comply with its obligations set forth on _Schedule
9.9(h)_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 9.10** ** ****Straddle Period**

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes attributable to a
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), such Taxes shall be allocated between the portion of the
Straddle Period that is a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the
Straddle Period that is a Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) in the case
of Taxes that are either (x) based on or measured by income, receipts, or
payroll of the Sold Entities or (y) imposed in connection with any sale,
transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible), based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
any Sold Entity holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at
such time), and (ii) in the case of other Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis with respect to the business or assets of the Sold Entities, based upon
the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period or
the Post-Closing Tax Period (as applicable) and the denominator of which is
the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.11** ** ****Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Payment of
Taxes**

 



 

(a) _Seller Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) The Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Sold Entities with
respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date and shall
remit to the applicable Sold Entity or Governmental Entity any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by applicable
Law) and the provisions of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
with respect to any Sold Entity, the U.S. federal and state income tax
deductions resulting from any payments in respect of Options, any severance
payments to non-continuing employees, any other compensatory payments, any
financing costs and other transaction expenses arising as a result of the
Transactions (including write-off of unamortized financing costs and other
similar items) shall be treated as accruing in the Pre-Closing Tax Period of
such Sold Entity.

 



 

(ii) Unless the applicable Partnership Sold Entity has in effect a valid
election under Code Section 754 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (a " _Section 754 Election_"), the Sellers and Blocker Sellers
shall cause each Partnership Sold Entity to make a Section 754 Election in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.754-1(b) for the taxable year
of such Partnership Sold Entity during which the Transactions occur pursuant
to this Agreement. Sellers shall not cause any Partnership Sold Entity to
revoke any Section 754 Election. If any Section 754 Election will be made for
the taxable year of such Partnership Sold Entity in which the Transactions
occur, then, prior to the filing of such Partnership Sold Entitys IRS Form
1065 for the taxable year during which the Transactions occur, Sellers
Representative shall provide to Buyer a draft of such IRS Form 1065 (and any
accompanying statements necessary to make the Section 754 Election) for
Buyers review and approval (such review and approval limited to matters
regarding the Section 754 Election), and upon such approval Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

Representative shall timely file, or cause to be filed, an IRS Form 1065
(together with any such accompanying statements) consistent with such approved
draft.

 



 

(b) _Buyer Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns for the Sold Entities with
respect to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date and shall remit
(or cause the Sold Entities to remit) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. With respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to any Sold Entity for a Straddle Period (" _Straddle Returns_ "),
such Straddle Returns shall be prepared by Buyer in a manner consistent with
past practice (unless otherwise required by applicable Law), and the Sellers
or the Blocker Sellers, as applicable, shall be responsible for Taxes with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period due in respect of such Straddle Returns.
The Buyer shall notify the Sellers Representative of any amounts due from the
applicable Seller or Blocker Sellers, in respect of any Straddle Return no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which such Straddle
Return is due, and the Sellers Representative or the applicable Seller or
Blocker Seller shall remit such payment to the Buyer no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the date such Straddle Return is due. The Buyer shall
deliver any Straddle Return to the Sellers Representative for its review at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required
to be filed. If the Sellers Representative disputes any item on such Tax
Return, it shall notify the Buyer of such disputed item (or items) and the
basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any
such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to
be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in
question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Sellers Representative and the Buyer. The fees and expenses
of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Sellers Representative
and the Buyer.

 



 

(c) _Amended Returns_. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (or
shall cause or permit any Sold Entity to) amend, refile or otherwise modify
any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to a Sold Entity with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without
the written consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such amendment, refiling or modification
is required by applicable Law or is not likely to increase the Tax liability
of any Seller or Blocker Seller or any of their Affiliates for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or to give rise to a payment under this Agreement by any Seller or
Blocker Seller or any of their Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event any audit or other proceeding is pending relating to Taxes for which
the Sellers or the Blocker Sellers or Buyer might have an indemnification
obligation pursuant to this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters), and
any Tax Return of the Sold Entities must be amended as a result of and based
upon the resolution of such audit or proceeding, the Buyer agrees to amend (or
cause the Sold Entities to amend) such Tax Return solely to reflect the
resolution of such audit or proceeding and the Sellers Representative shall
not withhold its consent to such amendment. The Sellers and Blocker Sellers
shall not (and shall not cause or permit any Sold Entity to) amend, refile or
otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to a Sold Entity
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the written consent of
Buyer if such amendment, refiling or modification

 



      
 

 



 

is reasonably likely to increase the Tax liability of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates for any Post-Closing Tax Period, except that, if such amendment,
refiling, or modification of a Tax Return occurs in connection with the Target
Tax Audit or otherwise required by applicable Law, such written consent of
Buyer is only necessary to the extent that such amendment, refiling or
modification is reasonably likely to increase the Tax liability of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates for any Post-Closing Tax Period, and such consent in
such circumstances shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,
that such Buyers prior written consent is not required if such amendment,
refiling, or modification of a Tax Return affects only the amount of the
Aggregate Blocker Attributes or changes the relative amounts of the Blocker
Closing Date NOLs or the Blocker Closing Date Aggregate Basis (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, by requiring capitalization of amounts deducted by
Target on a Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period).

 



 

(d) _Refunds_. Except to the extent reflected as an asset in the calculation
of Closing Working Capital, the Sellers or the Blocker Sellers, as applicable,
will be entitled to any credits or refunds of Taxes (including amounts
credited against Taxes otherwise payable) of any Sold Entity in respect of any
Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that Sellers and Blocker
Sellers shall not be entitled to any refund or credit of Taxes to the extent
such Taxes were not (i) paid by any Sold Entity prior to the Closing or by the
Sellers or Blocker Sellers (including through the Fund Indemnity) or (ii)
included as a current liability in Closing Working Capital. With respect to
any credits or refunds of Taxes of any Sold Entity in respect of any Post-
Closing Tax Period, Buyer or such Sold Entity, as applicable, will be entitled
to such credits or refunds of Taxes (including amounts credited against Taxes
otherwise payable). The Buyer shall cause the amount of any refund or credit
to which the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers are entitled to receive pursuant
this _Section 9.11(d)_ (Refunds) to be paid to the Sellers Representative on
behalf of the Sellers and Blocker Sellers promptly after such refund or credit
is received, allowed or applied against any Tax liability by the Buyer or any
Sold Entity following the Closing. If any Seller or Blocker Seller receives
any refund or credit of Tax of any Sold Entity (other than any refund or
credit of Tax which the Sellers and Blocker Sellers are entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Section 9.11(d)_ (Refunds)), the Sellers Representative
will cause the amount of such refund or credit to be paid to Buyer promptly
after such refund or credit is received, allowed or applied against any Tax
liability. Buyer shall not claim (or cause any Sold Entity to claim) any
credit or refund of Tax by carrying back any loss, credit or other Tax benefit
from any Post-Closing Tax Period to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.12** ** ****Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation**

 



 

(a) _Notice_. After the Closing, each party to this Agreement shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the
commencement of an audit received by such party from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person with respect to Taxes for which such other party
is liable pursuant to this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters);
_provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such notice will not affect
such other partys rights to indemnification under this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters), except to the extent that such party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information (to
the extent known) describing

 



      
 

 



 

the asserted Tax liability and shall include copies of the relevant portion of
any notice or other document received from any Governmental Entity or any
other Person in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

 



 

(b) _Contest_. (i) Subject to (iii) below, in the case of any audit, claim for
refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted Tax
liability or refund with respect to any Sold Entity (any such audit, claim for
refund, or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability referred to herein
as a " _Contest_ ") after the Closing Date that relates solely to Taxes for
which Buyer is indemnified under this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax
Matters), the Sellers Representative shall control the conduct of such
Contest, but Buyer shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its
own expense, and the Sellers Representative shall not be able to settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that is reasonably
likely to increase the Tax liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any
Post-Closing Tax Period, without the written consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ , that,
if such settlement, compromise or concession affects only the amount of the
Aggregate Blocker Attributes or changes the relative amounts of the Blocker
Closing Date NOLs or the Blocker Closing Date Aggregate Basis (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, by requiring capitalization of amounts deducted by
Target on a Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period), such Buyers written
consent shall not be required.

 



 

(ii) Subject to (iii) below, in the case of a Contest after the Closing Date
that relates both to Taxes for which Buyer is indemnified under this _Article
IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters) and Taxes for which Buyer is not
indemnified under this _Article IX_ (Indemnification; Tax Matters), Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall jointly control the conduct of such Contest,
and neither Buyer nor the Sellers Representative shall settle, compromise
and/or concede such Contest without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(iii) In the case of the Target Tax Audit, the Sellers Representative shall
control the conduct of such Contest, but Buyer shall have the right to
participate from and after the Closing Date in such Contest at its own
expense, and after the date hereof Sellers Representative shall not be able
to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that is
reasonably likely to increase the Tax liability of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates for any Post-Closing Tax Period, without the written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; _provided_ , that, if such settlement, compromise or concession
affects only the amount of the Aggregate Blocker Attributes or changes the
relative amounts of the Blocker Closing Date NOLs or the Blocker Closing Date
Aggregate Basis (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by requiring
capitalization of amounts deducted by Target on a Tax Return for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period), such Buyers written consent shall not be required.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. Buyer, the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 9.12_
(Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation) and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall

 



       
 

 



 

include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to the filing of any Tax
Returns or the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Sellers, the Blocker Sellers and the Buyer
agree to cause the Sold Entities (A) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Sold Entities relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the later of (i) the expiration
of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer, the
Sellers or the Blocker Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods and (ii) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, the Sold Entities, the Sellers or the Blocker
Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records. Buyer, the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers further
agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed (including with respect to the Transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

 **SECTION 9.13** ** ****Certain Taxes and Fees**

 



 

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the other hand,
when due, and the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers will file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and
charges, and, if required by applicable Law, Buyer will join in the execution
of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The expense of such filings
shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and the Blocker Sellers, on
the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the other hand.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.14** ** ****Blocker Attributes**

 



 

(a) Promptly following the later of (i) the date that the Target Tax Audit is
concluded and (ii) the date that each Blockers U.S. federal income Tax Return
has been filed for the 2013 Short Year, the Sellers Representative shall
compute both (x) the Blocker Closing Date NOLs, and (y) the Blocker Closing
Date Aggregate Basis, applying any adjustments described below. For purposes
of the foregoing computation, the Sellers Representative shall (i) take into
account any audit adjustments resulting from the Target Tax Audit in
determining items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit of Target that
are allocable to each Blocker for the 2011 and 2012 taxable years, and (ii)
make corresponding adjustments to any items of income, gain, deduction, loss
and credit of Target that are allocable to each Blocker for the 2013 Short
Year based upon the manner in which such Tax items were required to be
adjusted or determined pursuant to the Target Tax Audit (for example, if as a
result of the Target Tax Audit, the IRS requires

 



      
 

 



 

Target and its Subsidiaries to amortize rather than expense costs related to
certain of their contracts for the 2011 or 2012 taxable year, then Targets
items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit allocable to each Blocker
for the 2013 Short Year shall be adjusted to equal the amount that would have
been allocable to each Blocker for such year if Target and its Subsidiaries
had amortized costs related to those contracts and any similar contracts for
the 2013 Short Year) (collectively, the adjustments in clauses (i) and (ii),
the " _Blocker Adjustments_ "). The Sellers Representative shall deliver a
notice to Buyer (an " _Attribute Notice_ ") of its computation of the Blocker
Closing Date NOLs and Blocker Closing Date Aggregate Basis (together with a
reasonably detailed schedule setting forth the Sellers Representatives
calculation thereof), as determined by the Sellers Representative in good
faith pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes). The Blocker
Closing Date NOLs and the Blocker Closing Date Aggregate Basis, as described
in the Attribute Notice delivered by the Sellers Representative will become
final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer and the Blocker Sellers (A) on the
sixtieth (60th) day following the Buyers receipt thereof, unless the Sellers
Representative receives from Buyer on or prior to such sixtieth (60th) day
written notice of the Buyers disagreement (an " _Attribute Dispute Notice_ ")
with any account or determination set forth in the Attribute Notice or (B) on
such earlier date as Buyer notifies the Sellers Representative that it does
not dispute the Attribute Notice. If Buyer timely delivers the Attribute
Dispute Notice, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall resolve any
disagreement set forth therein in accordance with the principles set forth on
_Schedule 3.14(h)_, utilizing the procedures set forth in _Section 2.3(c)_
(Working Capital; Closing Date RMR). Within five (5) Business Days following
the final determination of the Blocker Closing Date NOLs and the Blocker
Closing Date Aggregate Basis, if the Aggregate Blocker Attributes is less than
$68,000,000, the Blocker Sellers shall pay to Buyer an aggregate amount of
cash equal to 23% multiplied by the amount by which $68,000,000 exceeds the
Aggregate Blocker Attributes.

 



 

(b) If as the result of a Final Determination with respect to any Sold Entity
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, either the Blocker Closing Date NOLS or the
Blocker Closing Date Aggregate Basis are adjusted, then the Sellers
Representative shall recompute the Aggregate Blocker Attributes promptly
following such Final Determination taking into account any adjustments
required to be made as a result of such Final Determination (the "
_Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event that any Blocker Adjustments previously made are inconsistent with
any adjustments required to be made by a Final Determination, the adjustments
required by the Final Determination shall be applied in lieu of such
inconsistent Blocker Adjustments in computing the Redetermined Aggregate
Blocker Attributes. If there is more than one Final Determination that affects
either the Blocker Closing Date NOLs or the Blocker Closing Date Aggregate
Basis, then the Sellers Representative shall compute the Redetermined
Aggregate Blocker Attributes promptly following each such Final Determination.
Pursuant to such Final Determination, the Sellers Representative shall
deliver a notice to the Buyer (the " _Redetermination Notice_ ") of its
computation of the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes (together with a
reasonably detailed schedule setting forth the Sellers Representatives
calculation thereof), as determined by the Sellers Representative in good
faith pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes). The Blocker
Closing Date NOLs

 



      
 

 



 

and the Blocker Closing Date Aggregate Basis, as described in the
Redetermination Notice delivered by the Sellers Representative, will become
final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer and the Blocker Sellers (A) on the
sixtieth (60th) day following the Buyers receipt thereof, unless the Sellers
Representative receives from Buyer on or prior to such sixtieth (60th) day an
Attribution Dispute Notice with any account or determination set forth in the
Redetermination Notice or (B) on such earlier date as Buyer notifies the
Sellers Representative that it does not dispute the Redetermination Notice.
If Buyer timely delivers the Attribute Dispute Notice, the Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall resolve any disagreement set forth therein in
accordance with the procedure set forth in _Section 9.14(a)_ (Blocker
Attributes).

 



 

If Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes were not previously determined
pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes) as a result of a prior
Final Determination, then within five (5) Business Days following the final
determination of the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes, payments shall
be made between the parties as follows:

 



 

(i) if the Aggregate Blocker Attributes were not less than $68,000,000 and the
Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes are less than $68,000,000, then the
Blocker Sellers shall pay to Buyer an aggregate amount of cash equal to 23%
multiplied by the amount by which $68,000,000 exceeds the Redetermined
Aggregate Blocker Attributes;

 



 

(ii) if the Aggregate Blocker Attributes were less than $68,000,000 and the
Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes are less than the Aggregate Blocker
Attributes, then the Blocker Sellers shall pay to Buyer an aggregate amount of
cash equal to 23% multiplied by the amount by which the Aggregate Blocker
Attributes exceed the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes; and

 



 

(iii) if the Aggregate Blocker Attributes were less than $68,000,000 and if
the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes are more than the Aggregate
Blocker Attributes, then the Buyer shall pay to the Blocker Sellers an
aggregate amount of cash equal to 23% multiplied by the amount by which the
Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes exceed the Aggregate Blocker
Attributes; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Buyer shall not be required to
pay any amount to a Blocker Seller which is greater than the total amount
previously received by Buyer from such Blocker Seller pursuant to this
_Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes), reduced by any payments previously made
by Buyer to such Blocker Seller pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker
Attributes).

 



 

If Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes were previously determined
pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes) as a result of a prior
Final Determination (the immediately preceding computation of Redetermined
Aggregate Blocker Attributes, the " _Preceding Redetermined Aggregate Blocker
Attributes_ "), then within five (5) Business Days following the final
determination of the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes, payments shall
be made between the parties as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) if the Preceding Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes were not less
than $68,000,000 and the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes are less
than $68,000,000, then the Blocker Sellers shall pay to Buyer an aggregate
amount of cash equal to 23% multiplied by the amount by which $68,000,000
exceeds the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes;

 



 

(ii) if the Preceding Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes were less than
$68,000,000 and the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes are less than
the Preceding Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes, then the Blocker
Sellers shall pay to Buyer an aggregate amount of cash equal to 23% multiplied
by the amount by which the Preceding Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes
exceed the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes; and if the Preceding
Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes were less than $68,000,000 and if
the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes are more than the Preceding
Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes, then the Buyer shall pay to the
Blocker Sellers an aggregate amount of cash equal to 23% multiplied by the
amount by which the Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes exceed the
Preceding Redetermined Aggregate Blocker Attributes; _provided_ _,_ _however_
, that the Buyer shall not be required to pay any amount to a Blocker Seller
which is greater than the total amount previously received by Buyer from such
Blocker Seller pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes), reduced
by any payments previously made by Buyer to such Blocker Seller pursuant to
this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes).

 



 

(c) All payments required to be made by the Blocker Sellers to the Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes) shall be paid to Buyer
in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated in
writing by Buyer. All payments required to be made by the Buyer to the Blocker
Sellers pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (Blocker Attributes) shall be paid to
the Sellers Representative (on behalf of such Blocker Sellers) in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by the
Sellers Representative.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.15** ** ****Tax Treatment of Payments**

 



 

To the extent permitted by relevant Law, Buyer, the Sellers and the Blocker
Sellers shall treat all payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_
(Indemnification; Tax Matters) and any adjustments made pursuant to _Section
2.3_ (Working Capital; Closing Date RMR) as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for all relevant Tax purposes.

 **SECTION 10.10** ** ****Amendments**

 **SECTION 10.12** ** ****Schedules**

 



 

Any matter, information, item or other disclosure disclosed pursuant to any
Schedule hereto (whether or not an explicit cross-reference is included) in
respect of one provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosed to
Buyer in respect of any other provision of this Agreement to the extent that
it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such matters,
information, item or other disclosure in such Schedule is relevant to such
other provisions. The inclusion of any matter, information, item or other
disclosure set forth in any section of the Schedules shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission of any liability of the Sellers or the Blocker Sellers
or otherwise imply that such matter, information, item or other disclosure is
material or is required to be referred to or disclosed under this Agreement.
The information contained in the Schedules is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement and no disclosure in the Schedules relating to any possible
breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item
in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or
lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the parties to establish whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.13** ** ****Counterparts**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts, and
