11    vii     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER, dated as of December 22, 2003 (this "Agreement"), by and among Hanmi
Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), Hanmi Bank, a
California banking corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer
("Buyer Sub"), and Pacific Union Bank, a California banking corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Buyer, Buyer Sub and
the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the business
combination transaction provided for herein in which the Company will,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into
Buyer Sub, with Buyer Sub being the surviving entity (the "Merger");  
WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the Merger
be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and this Agreement
shall constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-2(g); and   WHEREAS, the parties desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1. The
Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance
with the California General Corporation Law (the "CGCL") and the California
Financial Code (the "CFC"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2
hereof), the Company shall merge with and into Buyer Sub. Buyer Sub shall be
the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Company") in the Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of California. The name of
the Surviving Company shall be Hanmi Bank. Upon consummation of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.   1.2.
Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, an agreement of
merger complying with Section 1101 of the CGCL (the "Agreement of Merger")
and an officers\' certificate complying with Section 1103 of the CGCL (the
"California Certificate"), substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A
hereto, shall be duly prepared, executed and filed first, with the California
Commissioner of Financial    Institutions (the "Commissioner") for
approval, and second, with the Secretary of State of the State of California
(the "California Secretary") on the Closing Date by the Company and Buyer
Sub. After the Agreement of Merger has been filed with the California
Secretary, Buyer Sub shall immediately file with the Commissioner a copy of
the Agreement of Merger certified by the California Secretary. The term
"Effective Time" shall mean the time when the Merger becomes effective
pursuant to Section 4887 of the CFC.   1.3. Effects of the Merger. At and
after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement, the CFC and the CGCL.   1.4. Closing of the Merger. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time on the date that is the
second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable
law) of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, other than
conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, or such other
date or time as the parties may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 1999
Avenue of the Stars, Suite 2900, Los Angeles, California, unless another
place is agreed upon by the parties. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Business Day" shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other
day on which banking organizations in the City of Los Angeles, California are
required or authorized by law to be closed.   1.5. Articles of
Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Buyer
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Company.   1.6. Bylaws. At the
Effective Time, the bylaws of Buyer Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Company.   1.7.
Board of Directors and Officers. The directors and corporate officers of
Buyer Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the
directors and corporate officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold
office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Company, until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.   ARTICLE II 
CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES   2.1. Effect on Company Common Stock. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company:   (a)
Each share of the common stock, par value $6.00 per share, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock") owned by Buyer or Buyer Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares in trust accounts, managed  
2    accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held
in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and
retired and no shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Buyer
(the "Buyer Common Stock"), or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.   (b) Subject to Sections 2.1(c) and 2.2, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Sections
2.1(a) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and become the right to
receive that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement:   (i) "Exchange Ratio" shall mean
the  quotient, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, of (A) the 
Purchase Price divided by (B) the Buyer Closing Share Price;   (ii)
"Outstanding Company Shares" shall  mean that number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and  outstanding as of the close of business on the date
of this Agreement,  as certified in writing by the Company\'s transfer agent,
a copy of  which certification shall be promptly delivered to Buyer;  
(iii) "Purchase Price" shall mean the  quotient, rounded to the nearest one
ten thousandth, of (A) the  Transaction Value divided by (B) the Outstanding
Company Shares;   (iv) Subject to clause (v) of this  Section 2.1(b),
"Share Component" shall mean:   (A) if the Buyer Closing Share  Price is
less than $19.00, the product of (x) 6,120,093  multiplied by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is 19 and  the denominator of which is the Buyer
Closing Share Price, but  not more than 6,644,672;   (B) if the Buyer
Closing Share  Price is greater than $18.99 but less than $25.01,
6,120,093;  and   (C) if the Buyer Closing Share  Price is greater than
$25.00, the product of (x) 6,120,093  multiplied by (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is 25 and  the denominator of which is the Buyer Closing
Share Price, but  not less than 5,773,672;   (v) "Transaction Value" shall
mean the  sum of (A) the Cash Component (determined without giving effect to
any  reduction pursuant to Section 2.1(d)) and (B) the product of (x) the 
Share Component determined as provided in clause (iv) above without 
giving   3     effect to Section 2.1(d) multiplied by (y) the Buyer
Closing Share  Price; provided, however, that if the first sentence of
Section 2.1(d)  is applicable such that there is a Cash Reduction Amount,
then for  purposes of this clause (v), the Cash Component shall be reduced by
the  Cash Reduction Amount and the Share Component shall be increased by an 
amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Cash Reduction  Amount
by the greater of the Closing Price and $19.00, and   (vi) The calculations
required by this  Section 2.1(b) shall be prepared by Buyer and subject to
review by the  Company and the Trustee.   (c) The Exchange Ratio shall be
subject to appropriate adjustments in the event that, subsequent to the date
of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Buyer Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities through any
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other like changes in Buyer\'s
capitalization.   (d) In the event that the sum of (i) the Cash Component,
(ii) 130% of the product of (A) the Purchase Price and (B) the number of
Dissenting Shares, if any, and (iii) the amount of cash estimated to
be payable with respect to fractional shares resulting from the Merger
(the "Aggregate Cash Price") shall exceed 58% of the Adjusted Transaction
Value, then the Cash Component shall be reduced such that the Aggregate Cash
Price shall not exceed 58% of the Adjusted Transaction Value (or such lesser
amount as may be necessary to enable Buyer\'s and the Company\'s respective
tax counsel to render the opinions referred to in Sections 8.2(e) and 8.3(e))
after giving effect to the proviso in Section 2.1(b)(v). The amount, if any,
by which the Cash Component is reduced pursuant to the preceding sentence is
referred to herein as the "Cash Reduction Amount." Adjusted Transaction Value
shall mean the Transaction Value calculated (prior to giving effect to the
first sentence of this Section 2.1(d) or the proviso in Section 2.1(b)(v))
using the average of the high and low price of one share of Buyer Common
Stock on the NASDAQ market on the Closing Date (the "Closing Price"), rather
than the Buyer Closing Share Price. The "Cash Component" shall mean
$164,562,490.   2.2. No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each
holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the
Effective Time) by the Buyer Closing Share Price. The "Buyer Closing Share
Price" shall mean the average of the daily volume weighted average sale price
of one share of Buyer Common Stock for the five trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date on the Nasdaq National   4    Market. No
such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights
in respect of any fractional share.   2.3. Shares of Dissenting Holders.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary but only to
the extent required by the CGCL, shares of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time and that are
held by holders of Company Common Stock who have voted against the Merger and
who comply with all provisions of the CGCL concerning the right of holders of
Company Common Stock to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of
their shares of Company Common Stock (the "Dissenting Shareholders," with the
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting Shareholders being
referred to as the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration but shall only be entitled to such rights
as are granted to them pursuant to Sections 1300 - 1312 of the CGCL;
provided, however, that any Dissenting Shares which, at any time after the
Effective Time, lose their status as Dissenting Shares under the CGCL shall
forfeit the right to appraisal and all such Dissenting Shares shall then be
deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration without interest. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of any such demands for appraisal,
withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related instruments
received by the Company and the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Buyer, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment,
or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or the
taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary
to perfect appraisal rights under the CGCL.   2.4. Options. (a) At the
Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Option") which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior thereto, whether vested or unvested, shall
cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and
shall be assumed together with the Company 2000 Stock Option Plan and shall
be converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to the original Company Option (including full vesting and
exercisability as a result of and following the Merger), that number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Company Common Stock, at
a price per share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to
the per share exercise price specified in such Company Option divided by the
Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any Company Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to
such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall reserve for issuance the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock necessary to satisfy
Buyer\'s obligations under this Section 2.4. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Buyer shall issue to each holder of an outstanding Company
Option a document   5    evidencing the conversion and assumption of the
Company Option by Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.4.   (b) Within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the Effective Time, Buyer shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to the
options referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.4 and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein, as well as comply with state securities or
"blue sky" laws, for so long as such options remain outstanding.   2.5.
Buyer to Make Merger Consideration Available. Buyer shall appoint an agent,
who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for
the purpose of exchanging certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
for the amount or kind of consideration to be received by holders of Company
Common Stock under this Agreement (the "Merger Consideration"). At or
promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates
representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock and an estimated amount of cash
sufficient to pay any cash that may be payable in lieu of any fractional
shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Buyer Common Stock, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund").   2.6. Exchange of Shares. (a) As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more than
five Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of Buyer
Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock, if
any, into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder
of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this Article II and a check representing the amount of cash (if any)
payable in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock which such former
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.   (b) No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in   6    accordance with this Article II. After the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, with a record date after the
Effective Time and which theretofore had become payable with respect to whole
shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such Certificate.   (c) If any
certificate representing shares of Buyer Common Stock is to be issued in the
name of a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.   (d) At and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Buyer, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article
II.   (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for twelve months after the Effective Time shall
be paid, at the request of Buyer, to Buyer. Any stockholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Buyer for payment of the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends
and distributions on the Buyer Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder at the Effective Time
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Buyer, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly

by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Buyer, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Buyer may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim

U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such

or to one or more of such party\'s covenants contained in Article VI;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the

not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect under the standard established by Section 3.2, and (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party that

a Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein) with respect to either the
Company or Buyer, respectively.   3.2. Standards. (a) No representation or

or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance
or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances
or events inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in
Article IV or Article V, as the case may be, has had or is reasonably likely

prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such subsequent filing), no such
Buyer Report (when filed and at their respective effective time, if
applicable) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading, and there are no outstanding comments from or
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Buyer Reports.

Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 filed with the SEC

Section 5.12 (including the related notes, where applicable) fairly present,
and the financial statements to be filed by   29    Buyer with the SEC
after the date of this Agreement will fairly present (subject, in the case of
the unaudited statements, to recurring audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount, none of which are expected to be material to Buyer), the consolidated
results of the operations and financial position of Buyer for the respective
fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth; each of such
statements (including the related notes, where applicable) complies, and the
financial statements to be filed by Buyer with the SEC after the date of this
Agreement will comply, with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and each of
such statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been, and
the financial statements to be filed by Buyer with the SEC after the date of
this Agreement will be, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during and throughout the periods involved, except as indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.

accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.   (b) Except
for (i) those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved for in the
consolidated financial statements of Buyer included in its Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003, as filed with
the SEC or (ii) liabilities incurred since September 30, 2003 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, neither Buyer nor Buyer Sub
has incurred any material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued or contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become
due), other than pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement (including
Section 5.7 hereof) and except as is not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Buyer.   5.13. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. (a)
Except as disclosed in any Buyer Report filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, since December 31, 2002, there has been no change or development
or combination of changes or developments which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Buyer.   (b) Except as disclosed in any Buyer Report filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, since September 30, 2003, Buyer and Buyer Sub have
carried on their business only in the ordinary and usual course consistent
with past practices and have not taken any action that would have been
prohibited by Section 6.2 if taken after the date of this Agreement.   5.14.
Opinion. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has received an
opinion from the Buyer Advisor to the effect that, as of the date thereof and
based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the stockholders of the Company is fair to Buyer
from a financial point of view. Such opinion has been confirmed in writing
and has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.  
5.15. Buyer Disclosure Controls and Procedures. None of Buyer\'s records,
systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained,
operated   30    or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by
any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Buyer
or its accountants. Buyer has devised and maintained a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.   ARTICLE VI

to subsection (e) below, the parties hereto shall cooperate with each other
and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In

reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they

Solicitation by the Company or Buyer. (a) Each of the Company and Buyer agree
that it shall, and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
(including without limitation any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it) to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties that may be
ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), and will use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, including by requesting the other party to promptly return or
destroy any confidential information previously furnished by such
party thereunder. From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Buyer shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any
of its directors, officers or employees (and, in the case of Buyer, those of
Buyer Sub) or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by it (or, in the case of Buyer, by Buyer
Sub) to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate

take any other action designed to facilitate or that is likely to result in,
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide
any confidential information or data to any person relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations

principle, merger agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Acquisition Proposal or propose to do any of the foregoing, or (v) make or
authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that prior to the date of its
Stockholders Meeting, if a party\'s Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consulting with its outside legal and financial advisors, that
the failure to do so would breach, or would reasonably be expected to result
in a breach of, its Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable law, such
party may, in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal not
solicited in violation of this Section 7.2(a) that its Board of Directors
believes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below),
subject to providing 48 hour prior written notice of its decision to take
such action to the other party and identifying the person making the proposal
and all the material terms and conditions of such proposal and compliance
with Section 7.2(b), following delivery of such notice (1) furnish
information with respect to itself to any person making such a
Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (as
determined by such party after consultation with its outside counsel) on
terms no more favorable to such person than the terms contained in any such
agreement between the Company and Buyer, and (2) participate in discussions
or negotiations regarding such a Superior Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or
offer, filing of any regulatory application or notice (whether in draft or
final form) or disclosure of an   37    intention to do any of the
foregoing from any person relating to any (w) direct or indirect acquisition
or purchase of a business that constitutes a substantial portion of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company or Buyer, as the case may be,
(x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class of equity
securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of the Company
or Buyer, as the case may be, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company or Buyer, as the case may be,
or (z) merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or
Buyer, as the case may be, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or, in the case of Buyer, transactions permitted by Section 6.2 or
contemplated by Section 5.7, including the transaction described therein and
in the Financing Commitment Letters. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal made by a third
party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the
combined voting power of the shares of the Company Common Stock or the Buyer
Common Stock, as the case may be, then outstanding or all or substantially
all of the Company\'s or Buyer\'s, as the case may be, consolidated assets,
which after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation) (i) is on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company or
Buyer, as the case may be, determines in its good faith judgment to be more
favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger
and, in the case of Buyer, the transactions contemplated by the VAS
Agreement, (ii) that constitutes a transaction that, in such Board of
Directors\' good faith judgment, is reasonably likely to be consummated on
the terms set forth, and (iii) for which financing, to the extent required,
is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, is reasonably likely
to be obtained by such third party.   (b) In addition to the obligations of
the Company and Buyer, as the case may be, set forth in Section 7.2(a), each
party shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise the other orally and in writing
of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry which could lead
to an Acquisition Proposal) and keep the other informed, on a current basis,
of the continuing status thereof and shall contemporaneously provide to the
other all materials provided to or made available to any third party pursuant
to this Section 7.2 which were not previously provided to the other.   (c)
The Company shall immediately advise the Trustee orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry which could lead to an Acquisition
Proposal) that it may receive and keep the Trustee informed, on a current
basis, of the continuing status thereof and shall consult with the Trustee
prior to taking or failing to take any action pursuant to this Section 7.2.
The provisions of this Section 7.2(c) are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Trust and the Trustee, and
their successors.   38    (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, each of the Company and Buyer and its respective Board of
Directors shall be permitted to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that compliance with
such Rules will in no way limit or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.   (e) Nothing in
this Section 7.2 shall be read so as to restrict Buyer\'s pursuit and
consummation of the Financing.   7.3. Access to Information. (a) The parties
agrees that, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating
to the exchange of information, each shall afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives and, during such period, such
party shall make available to the other (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal securities laws or Federal or
state banking, consumer finance or protection laws (other than reports or
documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law)
and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as the other party may reasonably request. Such party shall not be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  
(b) All information furnished to either party by the other party pursuant to
Section 7.3 shall be subject to, and such receiving party shall hold all such
information in confidence in accordance with, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (other than the provisions set forth in the second
full paragraph on page 4 thereof), dated as of November 7, 2003, between the
Company and Buyer (the "Confidentiality Agreement").   (c) No investigation
by a party or its Representatives shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the other party set forth herein.  
(d) The Company shall provide Buyer with reasonable notice of and the
opportunity to have an observer present at all meetings of the Company\'s
management loan committee.   (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and Buyer (and each of their
respective employees, representatives, or other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and any
facts that may be relevant to the tax structure of the  
39    transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
neither the Company nor Buyer (nor any of their respective employees,
representatives or other agents thereof) may disclose any other information
that is not relevant to understanding the tax treatment and tax structure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any other information to
the extent that such disclosure could result in a violation of any federal or
state securities law.   7.4. Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Buyer
and the Company will give prompt notice to the other (and subsequently keep
the other party informed on a current basis) upon its becoming aware of
the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (i)
is reasonably likely to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to
it, or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein;
provided, however, that the mere delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 7.4 shall not have any effect for the purpose of determining the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VIII of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available to any such party
hereunder.   7.5. Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements. (a)
The Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in employee benefit
plans of Buyer or Buyer Sub in which similarly situated employees of Buyer or
Buyer Sub participate, to the same extent that similarly situated employees
of Buyer or Buyer Sub participate (it being understood that inclusion of
Company Employees in Buyer\'s employee benefit plans may occur at different
times with respect to different plans).   (b) With respect to each employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Buyer or Buyer Sub
for the benefit of current or former employees of Buyer or Buyer Sub (each
such plan, program, policy or arrangement, a "Buyer Plan") for which length
of service is taken into account for any purpose, service with the Company
(or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service
credit) shall be treated as service with Buyer for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits, including
for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of
pension benefits); provided however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of
any preexisting condition limitations. Each Buyer Plan shall waive pre-
existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable
Company Plan. Company Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under
a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Buyer Plan.  
(c) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume and honor and shall cause
Buyer Sub to assume and to honor in accordance with their terms all
agreements listed in Section 7.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Benefit Agreements"). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Merger will
constitute a merger,   40    sale or a change in control of the Company
for all purposes under such agreements. The provisions of this Section 7.5(c)
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
director, officer or employee that is a party to any Benefit Agreement.  
(d) Buyer agrees to have in effect on the Closing Date a defined contribution
plan that meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and which
includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (such plan, the "Buyer Savings Plan"). Each
Company Employee who is eligible to defer compensation under the Company
401(k) Savings Plan (the "Company Savings Plan") on the Closing Date shall be
eligible to participate in and defer compensation under Buyer Savings Plan as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date but in no event greater than
30 days following the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by law,
Buyer shall permit the Company Employees who are participants in Buyer
Savings Plan to rollover their accounts balances in the Company Savings Plan
into Buyer Savings Plan as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date.   7.6. Indemnification. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company (the
"Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of
its predecessors or affiliates or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided in the Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law from such
Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by a
final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in
the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with Buyer; provided, however, that (1) Buyer shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption Buyer
shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Buyer elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
that there are issues which raise conflicts of   41    interest between
Buyer and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Buyer, and Buyer
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Parties, (2) Buyer shall in all cases be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties, (3) Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
and (4) Buyer shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
Indemnification under this Section 7.6, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify promptly Buyer
thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Buyer under this Section 7.6 except to the extent such failure
to notify materially prejudices Buyer. Buyer\'s obligations under
this Section 7.6 shall continue in full force and effect without limit from
the Effective Time.   (b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
six years from the Effective Time by the directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company (provided that Buyer may
substitute therefor policy or policies of at least the same coverage amounts
and containing terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not materially
less advantageous to such directors and officers of the Company than the
terms and conditions of the existing directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy of the Company) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event
shall Buyer be required to expend on an annual basis more than 200% of the
annual premiums currently expended by the Company for the insurance covering
the officers and directors of the Company (the "Insurance Amount"), and
further provided that if Buyer is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance
called for by this Section 7.6(b) Buyer shall use all reasonable best efforts
to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance
Amount with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such.   (c) In the event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person entity, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Buyer assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.6.   (d) The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and representatives.   42     7.7. Reasonable Best Efforts;
Additional Agreements. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Buyer, Buyer Sub and the Company agrees to cooperate fully
with each other and to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, at the time and in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger, including using reasonable
best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other
order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
Merger.   (b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer.   7.8. Current Information. During the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a
regular and frequent basis with representatives of Buyer and to report the
general status of the ongoing operations of the Company. The Company will
promptly notify Buyer of any material change in the normal course of business
or in the operation of the properties of the Company and of any governmental
complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the
same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of significant
litigation involving the Company, and will keep Buyer fully informed of such
events.   7.9. Dividends. Until the Effective Time, Buyer and the Company
shall coordinate the declaration and payment of any dividends in respect of
Buyer Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates and
the payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of Buyer and the
Company that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect
to their shares of Company Common Stock and/or any shares of Buyer Common
Stock that any such holder receives in exchange therefor pursuant to the
Merger.   7.10. Stockholder Approvals. (a) The Company shall duly take all
lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which
the Form S-4 becomes effective (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the
purpose of obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock to adopt this Agreement
(the "Required Company Vote") and, except as provided hereby, shall take
all reasonable action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by
such stockholders. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
stockholders of the Company (the "Company Recommendation"); provided,
however, that, if the Company receives a Superior Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company may (x) withdraw, modify, qualify in any manner
adverse to Buyer, condition or refuse to make such  
43    recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public
statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent
with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Company
Recommendation") if the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good
faith after consulting with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
the failure to take such action would breach, or would reasonably be expected
to result in a breach of, its fiduciary obligations under applicable law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement shall (unless
the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms) be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation.   (b) Buyer shall duly take all lawful action to call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as
practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective
(the "Buyer Stockholders Meeting" and together with the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the "Stockholders Meetings") for the purpose of obtaining the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Buyer Common Stock voted in person or by proxy at the Buyer Stockholders
Meeting to approve the issuance of the shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger and the Financings (the "Required Buyer Vote") and, except as
provided hereby, shall take all reasonable action to solicit such approval by
its stockholders. The Board of Directors of Buyer shall recommend such
approval by the stockholders of Buyer (the "Buyer Recommendation"); provided,
however, that, if the Buyer receives a Superior Proposal, the Board of
Directors of Buyer may (x) withdraw, modify, qualify in any manner adverse to
the Company, condition or refuse to make such recommendation or (y) take any
other action or make any other public statement in connection with the Buyer
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a
"Change in Buyer Recommendation") if the Board of Directors of Buyer
determines, in good faith after consulting with its outside financial and
legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would breach, or would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Buyer at the Buyer
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting or the adoption of
this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Buyer
of such obligation.   7.11. Subsequent Interim and Annual Financial
Statements. As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available,
but in no event more than 30 days, after the end of each calendar month
ending after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall furnish to Buyer
financial statements (including balance sheet, statement of operations and
stockholders\' equity) of the Company as of and for such month then ended.
All information furnished by the Company hereto pursuant to this Section 7.11
shall be held in confidence by Buyer to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.   7.12.
Reorganization; Certain Modifications. Buyer and the Company will (i) use all
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to constitute a
reorganization   44    under Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) not
take any action or fail to take any action required hereby that could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Buyer and
the Company shall execute and deliver officer\'s certificates containing
appropriate representations at such time or times as may be reasonably
requested by counsel, including the effective date of the Form S-4 and the
Closing Date, for purposes of rendering opinions with respect to the Tax
treatment of the Merger.   7.13. Exemption From Liability Under Section
16(b). Assuming that the Company delivers to Buyer the Section 16 Information
(as defined below) reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Board
of Directors of Buyer, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective
Time adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders
(as defined below) of Buyer Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock, and of options to purchase Buyer Common Stock upon conversion
of Company Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information provided by the Company to Buyer prior to the Effective Time, are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. "Section 16
Information" shall mean information accurate in all respects regarding the
Company Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each
such Company Insider and the number and description of the Company Options
held by each such Company Insider. "Company Insiders" shall mean those
officers and directors of Company who are subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the
Section 16 Information.   7.14. Stock Exchange Listing. Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National

efforts to satisfy all conditions to the Financing set forth in the Financing

Buyer will keep the Company and the Trustee reasonably informed of the status
of the Financing. The Company shall provide, and will cause its officers and
employees to provide, all necessary cooperation and information in connection
with the arrangement and obtaining of the Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer, including, without limitation, facilitating customary due
diligence and arranging senior officers, as selected by Buyer, to meet with
prospective lenders and investors in customary presentations (including "road
show" presentations) or otherwise. Buyer shall not amend, supplement, modify
or terminate (whether unilaterally or by mutual consent) any Financing
Commitment Letters, or waive any rights thereunder, prior to the termination
of this Agreement, without the written consent of the Company and the
Trustee.   45     7.16. Termination of Certain Company Plans. (a) The
Company shall terminate, effective immediately preceding the Closing Date
(the "Plan Termination Date"), any and all 401(k) plans sponsored by the
Company (collectively, the "Terminated Company Plans") unless Buyer provides
notice to the Company that such Terminated Company Plans shall not be
terminated. Buyer shall receive from the Company evidence that the Terminated
Company Plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company\'s
Board of Directors (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of Buyer), effective as of the Plan

all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary

agreement prior to the Closing Date.   7.18. Board Seat. Promptly following
the Effective Time, consistent with applicable law and its bylaws, the number
of directors on the Board of Directors of Buyer shall be increased by one

created), and a director designated by the special committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company and acceptable to Buyer shall be appointed as a
Class I director of Buyer.   7.19. Consent Order. The Company shall use its

(provided that the Trustee consents in writing to such termination);   (b)
by either Buyer or the Company upon written notice to the other party (i) 30
days after the date on which any request or application for a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or
recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite
Regulatory Approval, unless within the 30-day period following such denial or
withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed
with the applicable Governmental Entity; provided, however, that no party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(b) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants of such party set forth herein, or (ii) if
any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;   (c) by
either Buyer or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated on
or before September 30, 2004, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
set forth herein;   (d) by either Buyer or the Company (provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if
there shall have been a breach of any of the   49    representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement by the other party, which breach is
not cured within thirty days following written notice to the party committing
such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) unless the breach
of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would
entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby under Section 8.2(a) (in the case of a
breach of a representation or warranty by the Company) or Section 8.3(a) (in
the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by Buyer);   (e) by
either Buyer or the Company (provided that the terminating party is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days
following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach
from the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the Closing;   (f) (i) by either Buyer or the Company if
the Required Buyer Vote shall not have been obtained at the Buyer
Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;   (g)
by either Buyer or the Company if the other party shall have breached the
terms of Section 7.2 hereof in any respect materially adverse to the other
party;   (h) (i) by Buyer if the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have failed to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company or shall have effected a Change in the Company
Board Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so, whether or not
permitted by this Agreement, (ii) by the Company, if the Board of Directors
of Buyer shall have failed to recommend the issuance of Buyer Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger and the Financing by the stockholders of Buyer, or
shall have effected a change in the Buyer Board Recommendation, or shall have
resolved to do so, whether or not permitted by this Agreement, or (iii) the
Company or Buyer, as the case may be, if the other shall have materially
breached its obligations under Section 7.10 by failing to call, give notice
of, convene and hold its respective Stockholders Meeting in accordance with
Section 7.10; or   (i) by the Company, but only during such period of time
beginning on the date of distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to the stockholders of the Company and ending on the date that the Company
Stockholders Meeting is held (but in no event more than 45 days after the
date of distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus), in the event
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Superior Proposal
it is necessary to terminate this Agreement in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Company and to the Company\'s stockholders under
applicable law; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company
may terminate this   50    Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(i)
solely in order to concurrently enter into a definitive acquisition agreement
or other similar agreement related to a Superior Proposal; and provided
further, however, that this Agreement may be terminated pursuant to this
Section 9.1(i) only after the fifth day following Buyer\'s receipt of written
notice from the Company advising Buyer that the Board of Directors of the
Company is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, and only if, during such
five-day period, if Buyer so elects, the Company and its advisors shall have
negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the
transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms.   9.2. Effect of
Termination. (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
Buyer or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect and none of Buyer, the Company, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any
of them or the Trustee shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever
hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except
that (i) Sections 7.3(b), 9.2 and 10.2 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of this
Agreement.   (b) The Company and Buyer agree that the agreement contained
in Sections 9.2(c) and 9.2(d) below are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and constitutes liquidated damages and not a
penalty.   (c) The Company shall pay Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the sum of twelve million dollars (the "Termination Fee") if
this Agreement is terminated as follows:   (i) by Buyer pursuant to Section
9.1(g)  or 9.1(h) or by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(i), in which
case  the Company shall pay the full amount of the Termination Fee on the 
second Business Day following such termination; and   (ii) by (A) Buyer
pursuant to Sections  9.1(d) or 9.1(e), or (B) by either Buyer or the Company
pursuant to  Section 9.1(c) and at the time of such termination, no vote of
the  stockholders of the Company contemplated by this Agreement at the 
Company Stockholder Meeting shall have occurred, and in the case of  clauses
(A) and (B) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company  shall have
been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made  known to the
senior management or Board of Directors of the Company and  the Trustee (or
any person shall have publicly announced, communicated  or made known an
intention, whether or not conditional, to make an  Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company) at any time after the  date of this Agreement and on
or prior to the date of termination of  this Agreement, then the Company
shall pay (x) an amount equal to 1/3  of the Termination Fee on the second
Business Day following such  termination, and (y) if   51     within 12
months after such termination the Company enters into a  definitive agreement
with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition  Proposal, then the Company
shall pay the remainder of the Termination  Fee on the date of such execution
or consummation.   (d) Buyer shall pay the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Termination Fee if this Agreement is
terminated as follows:   (i) by the Company pursuant to Section  9.1(g) or
9.1(h), in which case Buyer shall pay the full amount of the  Termination Fee
on the second Business Day following such termination;  and   (ii) by (A)
the Company pursuant to  Sections 9.1(d) or 9.1(e), (B) by either Buyer or
the Company pursuant  to Section 9.1(f), due to a failure to receive the
Required Buyer Vote  or (C) by either Buyer or the Company pursuant to
Section 9.1(c) and at  the time of such termination, no vote of the
stockholders of Buyer  contemplated by this Agreement at the Buyer
Stockholders Meeting shall  have occurred, and in the case of clauses (A),
(B) and (C) an  Acquisition Proposal with respect to Buyer shall have been
publicly  announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the senior 
management or Board of Directors of Buyer (or any person shall have  publicly
announced, communicated or made known an intention, whether or  not
conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Buyer)  at any
time after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the  date of the
Buyer Stockholders Meeting, in the case of clause (B), or  the date of
termination of this Agreement, in the case of clauses (A)  or (C), then Buyer
shall pay (x) an amount equal to 1/3 of the  Termination Fee on the second
Business Day following such termination,  and (y) if within 12 months after
such termination Buyer or Buyer Sub  enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummates, an  Acquisition Proposal, then Buyer shall pay
the remainder of the  Termination Fee on the date of such execution or
consummation.   9.3. Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable
law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by
the stockholders of the Company and Buyer; provided, however, that this
Agreement may be so amended by the parties hereto only with the prior written
consent of the Trustee; provided further, however, that after any approval of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company\'s and
Buyer\'s stockholders, there may not be, without further approval of such
stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement which changes the amount or
form of the consideration to be delivered to the Company stockholders
hereunder other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto. The provisions of this   52    Section 9.3 are

and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document

shall consent in writing to any agreement on the part of the Company to any
such extension or waiver. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.   ARTICLE X  GENERAL

and Agreements. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and
