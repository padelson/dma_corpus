and binding upon the parties in accordance with _Section 2.05(f)_.

 



 

(e) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the " _Consultation Period_ "), Sellers and Acquiror will
seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

 



 

(f) If, at the end of the Consultation Period, Sellers and Acquiror have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, then Sellers and Acquiror
will submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement (along with a copy of the Net Worth Adjustment Report marked to
indicate those line items that are in dispute) to KPMG LLP (as determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.05(f)_, the " _Independent Accountant_ "). In the
event that KPMG LLP

 



      
 

 



 

refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Independent Accountant, the
parties shall cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent certified
public accounting firm in the United States of national recognition mutually
agreeable to the parties, in which event "Independent Accountant" shall mean
such firm. Within thirty (30) days after the submission of such matters to the
Independent Accountant, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Independent
Accountant will make a final determination, binding on the parties to this
Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items in the Net
Worth Adjustment Report as to which Sellers and Acquiror disagree as set out
in the Notice of Disagreement. With respect to each disputed line item, such
determination, if not in accordance with the position of Sellers or Acquiror,
shall not be more favorable to Sellers than the amounts advocated by Sellers
in the Notice of Disagreement or more favorable to Acquiror than the amounts
advocated by Acquiror in the Net Worth Adjustment Report with respect to such
disputed line item. The proceeding before the Independent Accountant shall be
an expert determination under the Laws of the State of New York governing
expert determination and appraisal proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Independent Accountants review of the Net Worth Adjustment Report shall
be limited to a determination of whether such document was prepared in
accordance with this Agreement, and the Independent Accountant shall not
review any line items or make any determination with respect to any matters
not subject to a dispute in the Notice of Disagreement. The Final Net Worth
Adjustment Report that is final and binding on the parties, as determined
either through (i) failure to deliver a Net Worth Adjustment Report and an
election by Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)(ii)_, (ii) failure to timely
deliver a Notice of Disagreement pursuant to _Section 2.05(d)_, (iii)
agreement of the parties pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_ or _2.05(e)_ or (iv)
through the action of the Independent Accountant pursuant to this _Section
2.05(f)_, is referred to as the " _Final Net Worth Adjustment Report_." The
final form of the consolidated balance sheet of the Companies as of the
Closing Date reflected in the Final Net Worth Adjustment Report is referred to
as the " _Final Balance Sheet_ " and the amount of the Net Worth and Net Worth
Adjustment Amount calculated therefrom, and set forth therein, are referred to
as the " _Final Net Worth_ " and the " _Final Net Worth Adjustment Amount_ ",
respectively.

 



 

(g) The cost of the Independent Accountants review and determination will be
shared equally by Sellers, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand.
During the review by the Independent Accountant, Acquiror and Sellers will
each make available to the Independent Accountant interviews with such
individuals, and such information, books and records and work papers, as may
be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to fulfill its
obligations under _Section 2.05(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
independent accountants of Sellers or Acquiror will not be obligated to make
any work papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and until such
firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

 



 

(h) The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " will be the amount equal to the Final
Net Worth Adjustment Amount _minus_ the Estimated Net Worth Adjustment Amount.
If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Acquiror will pay in
cash to Sellers the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing
Adjustment is a negative amount, then Sellers will pay in cash to Acquiror an
amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such
payment will be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final Purchase
Price is determined, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate
calculated and

 



      
 

 



 

payable in accordance with _Section 2.07_. The Purchase Price, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.05(h)_, shall be referred to herein as
the " _Final Purchase Price_."

or is related solely to, a Title IV Plan sponsored or maintained solely by an

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in compliance
with its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, other

Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Business. There are no pending or,
to Sellers Knowledge, threatened disputes or claims involving a Company
Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) that individually or in

Section 401(a) of the Code has received (or timely filed an application for) a
favorable determination, opinion or advisory letter from the IRS that such
plan is so qualified and no action or amendment has been taken or made that
could be reasonably anticipated to adversely affect the qualified status of
such plan.

 



 

(c) _Section 3.15(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists each "employee
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, sponsored, maintained,

Companies or any ERISA Affiliate of the Companies has or could have any
liability that is or at any relevant time was subject to Section 412 of the
Code, Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA (each, a " _Title IV Plan_ ").
Except as would not create a material liability with respect to the Business,

or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA; (ii) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan and no condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to present a risk that such proceedings will be
instituted; (iii) no "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA)
has occurred with respect to any Title IV Plan, nor has notice of any such
event been required to be filed for any Title IV Plan, in any case within the
past 12 months; (iv) no Title IV Plan has failed to satisfy the minimum
funding standard (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and none of the Companies or any ERISA

IV Plan, and there has been no determination that any such plan is, or is
expected to be, in "at risk" status (within the meaning of Section 303(i)(4)
of ERISA or Section 430(i)(4) of the Code); (v) the present value of all
accrued benefits under any Title IV Plan (based on those assumptions used to
fund such plan) did not, as of the most recent annual valuation date in

 



      
 

 



 

respect of each such plan, exceed the fair market value of the assets of the
plan allocable to such benefits. Except as would not create a material
liability with respect to the Business, neither the Companies nor ERISA
Affiliate thereof has incurred any liability under Section 412 of the Code,
Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in any liability to, or encumbrance on the assets, of any Company
(whether actual or contingent) under Title IV of ERISA.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.15(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan provides or is required to provide to any
Employee (or former employee of any Company) and no Companies are required to

to have any material liability on account of a violation of COBRA or similar
state Law.

 



 

(e) Except as would not individually or in the aggregate create a material
liability with respect to the Business, no "prohibited transaction" under

collective bargaining agreements or other labor agreements relating to the
Business or to which any Company is a party or by which any Company is bound.

 



 

(g) Except as would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Business, no Company is a party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or would result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount that would be
subject to the provisions of Sections 280G or 4999 of the Code (without regard
to the exceptions set forth in Sections 280G(b)(4) and 280G(b)(5) of the Code)
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Company has

liabilities or obligations, in either case, that would impair or adversely
affect such resources and capabilities. Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that

obtain those consents, approvals, licenses, permits, orders, qualifications,
authorizations or registrations set forth in _Section 4.03_ of the Acquiror
Disclosure Schedule. As of the date hereof, no Governmental Authority, with
respect to which any such consent, approval, license, permit, order,
qualification, authorization or registration is required to be obtained or
made in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements has, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, indicated to

action that is reasonably likely to prohibit, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements.

the probable success or profitability of the ownership, use or operation of
the Business and the Companies by Acquiror after the Closing or (iii) any

behalf of Sellers or by any Affiliate of Sellers or by any of their
Representatives.

its Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that the auditors and independent
accountants of Acquiror or its Affiliates shall not be obligated to make any

_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between CMFG Life, on the one hand and
Acquiror, on the other hand, are incorporated into this Agreement by reference
and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time
the confidentiality obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate. If, for any reason, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Companies), on the other hand,
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, treat as
confidential any information, and not use to the detriment of the other
parties hereto (including for the purposes of competing with the other parties
or their Affiliates), any information relating to or obtained from the other
parties or their Affiliates (including with respect to Acquiror following the
Closing, the Companies), regardless of the form in which such information is
communicated or maintained, and all notes, reports, analyses, compilations,
studies, files or other documents or material, whether prepared by such party,
its Affiliates or its Representatives, which are based on, contain or
otherwise reflect such information, except that the foregoing requirements of
this _Section 5.04(b)_ shall not apply to information relating to CUMIS
Retained Business or to the extent that (i) any such information becomes
available to the public other than (A) in the case of information relating to
Acquiror, as a result of disclosure by Sellers, their Affiliates or any of
their Representatives in breach of this _Section 5.04_ and (B) in the case of
information relating to Sellers, as a result of disclosure by Acquiror, any
Company (after the Closing Date) or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives in breach of this _Section 5.04_ or (ii) any such information
was or becomes available to such party on a non-confidential basis, directly
or indirectly, from a source (other than a party to this Agreement or any
Affiliate or Representative of such party) that is not known by such party,
its Affiliates or its Representatives, in each case, after reasonable inquiry,
to be bound by any confidentiality obligation to the other party, its
Affiliates or its Representatives with respect to such information, or
otherwise known by such party, its Affiliates or its Representatives, in each
case, after reasonable inquiry, to be prohibited from transmitting the
information to such party, its Affiliates or its Representatives by a
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation. Each of the parties hereto shall
instruct its Affiliates and Representatives having access to such information
of such obligation of confidentiality and agrees that it is responsible for
any action or failure to act that would constitute a breach or violation of
this _Section 5.04_ by such partys Affiliates or Representatives.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.04(b)_ to the contrary, in the
event that any party hereto or its respective Affiliates or Representatives is
requested or required under applicable Law or the applicable rules or
regulations of any securities exchange or similar self-regulatory organization
having jurisdiction over such party, its Affiliates or its Representatives, as
applicable (including by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process), to disclose any information required to be treated as confidential
pursuant to _Section 5.04(b)_, it is agreed that such party shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable (i) inform the other party or parties, as
applicable, of the terms of any such request or requirement to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (ii) consult

 



      
 

 



 

with the other party or parties, as applicable, on the advisability of taking
legally available measures to resist or narrow any such request or requirement
and (iii) cooperate with such other party or parties, as applicable, at such
other partys or parties, as applicable, expense, in pursuing any such
reasonable measures that such other party or parties, as applicable, determine
to pursue to resist or narrow any such request or requirement. In the event
that disclosure of such information is ultimately required, the disclosing
party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, give the other party
or parties, as applicable, written notice of the information to be disclosed
as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and then may furnish
that portion (and only that portion) of such information which it is required
to disclose under such applicable Laws or rules or regulations, and such
party, its Affiliate or its Representative, as the case may be, shall
cooperate with the other party or parties, as applicable, at such other
partys or parties, as applicable, expense, in its reasonable efforts to
obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded any information so furnished.

 



 

(d) Prior to Closing, no party to this Agreement or any Affiliate or
Representative of such party shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or public announcement or otherwise communicate with any news media in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or under the rules of any securities exchange on which
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates are listed, in which case the party required
to publish such press release or public announcement shall allow the other
parties a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or public
announcement in advance of such publication.

 



 

(e) Each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements and the terms and conditions set forth herein and
therein shall be kept strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed or
otherwise made available to any other Person and that copies of this Agreement

made available to the public, except where such disclosure, availability or
filing is required by applicable Law or under the rules of any securities
exchange on which Acquiror or any of its Affiliates are listed and only to the
extent required by such Law or rules, as applicable. In the event that such
disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law or under the
rules of any securities exchange on which Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
are listed, each of the parties hereto agrees, upon the reasonable request of
any of the other parties hereto, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain "confidential treatment" or similar treatment of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements and to redact such terms of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements that any other party hereto shall reasonably
request.

consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or
become necessary for their respective execution and delivery of, and the
performance of their respective obligations pursuant to, and the consummation
of, the transactions contemplated by, the Transaction Agreements, and (ii)
shall

 



      
 

 



 

take all actions as may be required or requested by any applicable

transactions contemplated hereunder within ten (10) Business Days of the date
hereof and (y) make all other filings required pursuant to other applicable
Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements as promptly as practicable. The parties will cooperate with the
reasonable requests of each other in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Sellers and Acquiror shall
not take any action that they should be reasonably aware would have the effect
of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals.

indicated that it may impose, conditions on its approval of the transactions

or promulgation of any applicable Law restraining or prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, or (ii) any permanent
or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements in accordance with
the terms thereof unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, then, to the extent
necessary to comply with such conditions or to prevent the taking of such
action or the enactment, entry, enforcement or promulgation of any such
applicable Law or to vacate, modify or suspend any such injunction or order,

communication it receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other party or
parties, as applicable, to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority and shall provide each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between such

 



      
 

 



 

party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand. Except as otherwise
required or requested by the applicable Governmental Authority, Sellers and
Acquiror shall not agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other party or parties, as applicable, in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
party or parties, as applicable, the opportunity to attend and participate at
such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and to _Section
5.02_, Sellers and Acquiror will coordinate and cooperate fully with each
other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other party or parties, as applicable, may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing and, if applicable, in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
party shall be required to disclose to any other party any of its or its
Affiliates confidential competitive information. No party shall be required
to comply with any provision of this _Section 5.05(c)_ to the extent that
such compliance would be prohibited by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Sellers and Acquiror shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any other consents and approvals (other than those addressed in

connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall not be required to pay or
commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any third
party from whom any such consent or approval may be required and no party
shall be required to agree to any conditions or restrictions imposed by any
third party that, individually or in the aggregate, in the judgment of such
party, would materially impair (or would reasonably be expected to materially
impair) the ability of such party to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements.

the going concern value of the business of the Companies and the Transferred
Business to the extent permitted by applicable Law and that Acquiror would not

respective Affiliates, agree that irreparable damage would occur in the case

shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, including the
remedy of specific performance, to prevent any breach of _Sections 5.09_ ,
_5.10_ , _5.11_ or _5.12_.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Seller Intellectual Property_. Except as provided in the
Transaction Agreements:

 



 

(a) Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that
Acquiror is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title
or interest in and to

 



      
 

 



 

any Intellectual Property owned by Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the
Companies), including the name "CUNA Mutual Group", or any trade names,
trademarks, Internet domain names, tag-lines, identifying logos or service
marks related thereto or employing the words "CUNA Mutual Group", or any
variation of the foregoing or any confusingly similar trade name, trademark,
Internet domain name, service mark or logo, or any trade names, trademarks or
Internet domain names set forth in _Section 5.14_ to the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (including all registrations and applications relating thereto)
(collectively, the " _Seller Names and Marks_ "), and, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this _Section 5.14_, neither Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall have any rights
in the Seller Names and Marks and neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall contest the ownership or
validity of any rights of Sellers or any of their Affiliates in or to the
Seller Names and Marks.

 



 

(b) Acquiror agrees that, except as otherwise provided in this _Section
5.14_, following the Closing Date, Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the
Companies) shall cease and discontinue all uses of the Seller Names and Marks,
either alone or in combination with other words and all marks, trade dress,
logos, monograms and other source identifiers similar to any of the foregoing
or embodying any of the foregoing alone or in combination with other words.
Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the
Companies), agrees that the rights of the Companies to the Seller Names and
Marks pursuant to the terms of any trademark agreements shall terminate on the
Closing Date.

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, and in no event later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, or such additional period as
mutually agreed by the parties in writing, Acquiror and its Affiliates
(including the Companies) shall re-label, destroy or exhaust all materials
bearing the Seller Names and Marks, including signage, advertising,
promotional materials, Software, packaging, inventory, electronic materials,
collateral goods, stationery, business cards, web sites, and other materials,
and make all filings with any office, agency or body to effect the elimination
of any use of the Seller Names and Marks from the businesses of the Companies,
so as to bring Acquiror and its Affiliates into compliance with this _Section
5.14_; _provided_ , that Acquiror shall commence the removal of the Seller
Names and Marks from all such materials immediately following the Closing Date
and shall immediately upon the Closing Date cease all use of the Seller Names
and Marks on all stationary, business cards, purchase orders, invoices, and
similar correspondence. Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that
use of the Seller Names and Marks during the period authorized by this
_Section 5.14_ shall be only with respect to goods and services of a level of
quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods and services with
respect to which the Companies used the Seller Names and Marks prior to
Closing. Acquiror shall take all necessary action to ensure that other users
of the Seller Names and Marks, whose rights terminate upon the Closing
pursuant to this _Section 5.14_, shall cease use of the Seller Names and
Marks, except as expressly authorized thereafter by Sellers. Acquiror, for
itself and its Affiliates, agrees that after the Closing Date Acquiror and its
Affiliates (including the Companies) will not expressly, or by implication, do
business as or represent themselves as Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

 



 

(d) In the event Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror (including the
Companies) violates any of its obligations under this _Section 5.14_, Sellers
and their Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in equity for such
damages or other relief as a court may deem

 



      
 

 



 

appropriate. Acquiror acknowledges that a violation of this _Section 5.14_
may cause Sellers and their Affiliates irreparable harm which may not be
adequately compensated for by money damages. Acquiror therefore agrees that in
the event of any actual or threatened violation of this _Section 5.14_,
Sellers and their Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies
that they may have, to a temporary restraining order and to preliminary and
final injunctive relief against Acquiror or such Affiliate of Acquiror to
prevent any violations of this _Section 5.14_, without the necessity of
posting a bond.

effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) such Employee shall be
eligible for total incentive

 



      
 

 



 

compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than the total incentive

employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the

herein is intended to limit the right of Acquiror or the Companies (A) to
terminate the employment of any Employee at any time, (B) to change or modify
any incentive compensation or employee benefit plan or arrangement at any time
and in any manner, or (C) to change or modify or terminate the terms or

result in duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) Acquiror shall cause the Companies to recognize and provide all accrued
but unused vacation and sick pay of the Employees as of the Closing Date.
Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.01(a)_ or _6.01(b)_ , after the

Companies to pay to the Employees, when due and payable pursuant to the
Companies annual bonus plans, programs and practices, annual bonuses in an

Sheet with respect to 2014 bonuses, annualized to reflect a twelve (12) month
period _minus_ (y) any amounts not payable to such Employees under the terms
of such bonus plans, programs and practices (the " _Aggregate Amount_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Aggregate Amount with respect

pay such excess to the Employees in the form of newly granted retention
bonuses payable as of December 31, 2016 contingent upon such employees
continued employment with one of the Companies through such date.

 



 

(f) Acquiror and the Companies shall, and hereby do, assume all liability and
obligation for, and none of Parent, Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall

of their Affiliates shall transfer to the Companies an amount of cash equal to
65% of the sum of (i) the amount payable on such date in respect of the
Transaction Bonus as determined by Sellers in accordance with the applicable
employment agreement and (ii) the amount of the employment Taxes to be paid in
respect of the Transaction Bonus payment; _provided_ , that Acquiror shall
notify Sellers within five (5) Business Days following the termination of
employment with the Companies of any Employee to whom a Transaction Bonus may
be payable and that has not previously been paid. After receipt of such funds,
Acquiror shall cause the Companies promptly to pay to the applicable Employee
when due the amount of the Transaction Bonus payments then payable and shall
be responsible for all withholding Taxes and reporting obligations that arise
in connection with the payment of the Transaction Bonus payments.

 



 

(i) The provisions of this _Article VI_ are solely for the benefit of
Sellers, Acquiror, the Companies and their respective Affiliates and nothing
in this _Article VI_, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee or
other service provider (including any Employee), or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits
of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Article VI_, express or implied, shall be (i) deemed to create any employee
benefit plan or amend any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) construed to prevent
Acquiror, Sellers, any Company or any of their respective Affiliates from
terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit
plan in accordance with its terms. Nothing in this _Article VI_ shall: (A)
grant any rights or benefits to any Person other than the Seller, the
Acquiror, the Companies and their respective Affiliates or (B) amend, or may
be construed as amending, any employee benefit plan.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 7.01 _Liability for Taxes_.

Parties against (i) any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage
attributable to all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) imposed on the
Companies pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 or similar provision of state or
local law solely as a result of the Companies having been a member of an
affiliated, combined, unitary or Consolidated Tax Group prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) Taxes imposed on the Companies for any taxable year or period
that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending

 



      
 

 



 

on and including the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall
not be liable for or pay, and shall not indemnify Acquiror from and against,
(A) any Taxes to the extent of the amount taken into account as a liability or
reserve for Taxes in preparing the Final Net Worth Adjustment Report, (B) any
Taxes that result from any actual or deemed election under Section 336(e) or
Section 338 of the Code or any similar provisions of state, local or foreign
Law as a result of the purchase of the Shares or that result from Acquiror,
any Affiliate of Acquiror or the Companies engaging in any activity or
transaction that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be treated as a purchase or sale of assets of the Companies for Tax
purposes and (C) any Taxes imposed on the Companies as a result of
transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly allocable (based
on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth in Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing
(Taxes described in this proviso, hereinafter " _Excluded Taxes_ "). Acquiror
and Sellers agree that, with respect to any transaction described in clause
(C) of the preceding sentence, the Companies and all persons related to the
Companies under Section 267(b) of the Code immediately after the Closing shall
treat the transaction for all federal income Tax purposes (in accordance with
Treas. Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) and (to the extent permitted) for other
income Tax purposes, as occurring at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date. Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit against)
Taxes allocable to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the
Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, except to the extent
that a related tax receivable is shown on the Final Balance Sheet as reflected
in the Final Net Worth Adjustment Report. Sellers and Acquiror shall cooperate
with, and provide reasonable and timely notice to, the other regarding the
availability of such refunds or credits and take such steps as may be
reasonably required on the part of Acquiror and its Affiliates to secure any
such refund or credit, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) Acquiror shall be liable for and pay (i) all Taxes imposed on the
Companies for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date
and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date and (ii) Excluded Taxes.

 



 

(c) For purposes of _Sections 7.01(a)_ and _7.01(b)_ , whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Companies for the
portion of a Straddle Period that includes (but does not end) on the Closing
Date, the amount of any income, capital or premium Taxes for the pre-closing
tax period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which any of the
Companies hold a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time).

 



 

(d) Acquiror shall be liable for and pay any real property transfer or gains
Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax
imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sellers and Acquiror
agree that Sellers make no representation, warranty, and provide no other
assurance, with respect to the amount of any Tax Attributes of the Companies,
or with respect to the availability on and after the Closing Date of any Tax
Attributes of the Companies. Sellers shall have no liability for

 



      
 

 



 

any Taxes resulting from or arising with respect to any sale of the Companies
(or any assets thereof) following the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Sellers indemnification obligations under this _Section 7.01_ shall
survive until the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations, _plus_
thirty (30) days, and shall be calculated on an after-tax basis pursuant to
_Section 10.07(e)_.

 



 

Section 7.02 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) (i) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies on a combined,
consolidated or unitary basis with Sellers or any Affiliate thereof (other
than the Companies), (ii) all other income Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to the Companies for taxable years or periods ending
on or before the Closing Date, and (iii) all other Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) on or prior to the Closing Date. In each
case Sellers shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of
such Tax Returns. Acquiror shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when
due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies
after the Closing Date (other than income Tax Returns with respect to periods
for which a consolidated, unitary or combined income Tax return of Sellers
will include the operations of the Companies) and Acquiror shall remit or
cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. The
Acquiror shall be reimbursed by Sellers for Taxes for which Sellers are liable
pursuant to _Section 7.01(a)_ that are paid by Acquiror in connection with
Tax Returns filed by them pursuant to this _Section 7.02(a)_ within fifteen
(15) days after payment by the Acquiror or the Companies of such Taxes.

 



 

(b) All Tax Returns that Acquiror is required to file or cause to be filed in
accordance with this _Section 7.02_ that relate to any taxable year or period
ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period shall be prepared
and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns,
no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing
and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods unless otherwise required by
Law. Acquiror shall permit Sellers to review and comment on each such Tax
Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing.

 



 

(c) None of Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror shall (or shall cause or
permit the Companies to) make or change any Tax election, file in any
jurisdiction not previously filed in, amend, refile or otherwise modify (or
grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax
Return or other filing in respect of Taxes relating in whole or in part to the
Companies with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be withheld if such action is
required by Law), or take any other action that would increase any Tax
liability or reduce any Tax benefit in respect of any taxable year or period
ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Acquiror, the Companies and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns of the Companies pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision
of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Acquiror and the Companies agree to (A) retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Acquiror or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority and (B) give the other Party reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
the other Party so requests, the Companies or Sellers, as the case may be,
shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(e) Acquiror and Sellers agree, upon request, to provide the other Party with
all information that either Party may require to report pursuant to Code §6043
or Code §6043A, or Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Sellers agree
to provide Acquiror, upon request, information that may be requested by
Acquiror to accurately complete and timely file Form 8806 (if applicable).

(a) Acquiror shall promptly notify Sellers in writing upon receipt by
Acquiror, any of its Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, the Companies of
notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits or assessments relating to any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date or any Straddle Period or relating to a Tax for which Sellers may
be liable pursuant to this Agreement. Following the Closing Date, Sellers
shall promptly notify Acquiror in writing upon receipt by Sellers of notice of
any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits or
assessments relating to any taxable period of the Companies ending on or
before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period, that will affect any taxable
period of the Companies ending after the Closing Date.

delayed.

Section 10.02 _Indemnification by Sellers_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing and subject to _Article VII_ and the other provisions

Representatives (collectively, the " _Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ ")
against, and reimburse any Acquiror Indemnified Party for, all Losses that

 



      
 

 



 

such Acquiror Indemnified Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become
subject to, as a result of:

 



 

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Sellers at the Closing;
or

 



 

(ii) any breach or failure by Sellers to perform any of their covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify or hold harmless any Acquiror Indemnified Party against,
or reimburse any Acquiror Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant to
_Section 10.02(a)(i)_ (other than Losses arising as a result of the
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in
_Sections 3.01_ , _3.02_ , _3.03(a)_ , _3.03(b), 3.15_ , _3.22_ and _3.25_ )
(i) with respect to any claim (or series of related claims arising from the
same underlying facts, events or circumstances) unless such claim (or series
of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $75,000 (nor shall any such item
that does not meet the $75,000 threshold be applied to or considered for
purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties Losses for which Sellers have responsibility under clause (ii) below)
and (ii) until the aggregate amount of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties
Losses exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price, after
which Sellers shall be obligated for all Losses of the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties that in the aggregate are in excess of such amount. The cumulative
aggregate indemnification obligation of Sellers under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_
shall in no event exceed twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the Purchase
Price (other than in respect of Losses arising solely as a result of (A) the
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in
_Sections 3.01_ , _3.02_ , _3.03(a)_ , _3.03(b)_ , _3.15_ , _3.22_ and _3.25_
, for which such indemnification obligation shall in no event exceed 100% of
the Purchase Price in the aggregate or (B) fraud).

 



 

Section 10.03 _Indemnification by Acquiror_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing and subject to _Article VII_ and the other provisions
of this _Article X_, Acquiror shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and
their Affiliates (but not the Companies) and Representatives (collectively,
the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and reimburse any Seller
Indemnified Party for, all Losses that such Seller Indemnified Party may at
any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of:

 



 

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by

or reimburse any Seller Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant to _Section

breach of any representation or warranty made by

 



      
 

 



 

Acquiror in _Sections 4.01_ and _4.10_ ) (i) with respect to any claim (or
series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances) unless such claim (or series of related claims arising from the
same underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of
$75,000 (nor shall any such item that does not meet the $75,000 threshold be
applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of
the Seller Indemnified Parties Losses for which Acquiror has responsibility
under clause (ii) below) and (ii) until the aggregate amount of the Seller
Indemnified Parties Losses exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the
Purchase Price, after which Acquiror shall be obligated for all Losses of the
Seller Indemnified Parties that in the aggregate are in excess of such amount.
The cumulative aggregate indemnification obligation of Acquiror under _Section
10.03(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of
the Purchase Price (other than in respect of Losses arising solely as a result
of (A) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Acquiror in _Sections 4.01_ and _4.10_ , for which such indemnification
obligation shall in no event exceed 100% of the Purchase Price in the
aggregate or (B) fraud).

 



 

Section 10.04 _Notification of Claims_.

 



 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any pending
or threatened claim or demand by a third party that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim
or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim
being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article
X_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure,
it being understood that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the
expiration of any applicable survival period specified in _Section 10.01_ for
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if, prior to such applicable date, a party hereto shall have notified the
other parties hereto in accordance with the requirements of this _Section
10.04(a)_ of a claim for indemnification under this _Article X_ (whether or
not formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such
claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
_Article X_ notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 10.04(a)_, the Indemnifying Party, by notice to the
Indemnified Party delivered within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of
notice of such claim, may, but is not obligated to, assume the defense and
control of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense. The Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably
necessary to defend such Third Party Claim prior to the time that it receives
a notice from the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the preceding
sentence. Sellers or Acquiror, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each
of its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of,

 



      
 

 



 

or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the
consent of any Indemnified Party, _provided_ , that (i) such settlement does
not involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party pays or causes to be paid all amounts arising out of such
settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement,
(iii) such settlement does not encumber any of the material assets of any
Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to
or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any
Indemnified Partys business and (iv) the Indemnifying Party obtains, as a
condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from any and all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(c) If an Indemnified Party shall have a claim for indemnification hereunder
for any claim other than a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, as
promptly as is practicable and in any event within twenty (20) days of the
date on which the Indemnified Party had knowledge of such claim, give written
notice to the Indemnifying Party setting forth (i) a reasonably detailed
description of the claim, (ii) a good faith estimate of the amount of the
claim, and (iii) the specific representation(s), warranties or provision(s) of
this Agreement that the Indemnified Party assumes to be breached, and such
notice shall be accompanied by copies of all available material documentation
that may be necessary for the purposes of enabling the Indemnifying Party to
take any and all required actions in respect of the matter and Loss subject of
the claim. The failure to make delivery of the notice of claim by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party within the twenty (20) day period
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability under this
_Article X_ with respect to such matter, so long as the notice of claim is
given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in _Section
10.01_ and except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is in any way
prejudiced (including with respect to its right of defense) by failure to give
the notice of claim.

 



 

Section 10.05 _Payment_. In the event an Action for indemnification under this
_Article X_ shall have been finally determined, the amount of such final
determination shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, on demand in immediately
available funds. An Action, and the liability for and amount of damages
therefor, shall be deemed to be "finally determined" for purposes of this
_Article X_ when the parties to such Action have so determined by mutual
agreement or, if disputed, when a final nonappealable Governmental Order shall
have been entered.

 



 

Section 10.06 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedies_. Each of Sellers and
Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that:

 



 

(a) any liability for indemnification of a Loss hereunder and under any other
Transaction Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of such Loss;

 



 

(b) prior to the Closing, other than in the case of actual fraud by Sellers or
their Affiliates or Representatives, the sole and exclusive remedy of Acquiror
for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder shall be
refusal to close the purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder; and

 



       
 

 



 

(c) following the Closing, other than in the case of actual fraud by Acquiror
or Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and
except for breaches or non-performance of provisions in this Agreement for
which the remedy of specific performance is available pursuant to _Section
11.12_, the indemnification provisions of _Article X_ and, with respect to
Taxes, _Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach
of the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or instrument delivered hereunder, and for any failure to perform
or comply with any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. If
there shall be any conflict between the provisions of this _Article X_ and
_Section 7.03_ (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of _Section 7.03_
shall control with respect to Tax contests.

 



 

Section 10.07 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 



 

(a) Sellers and Acquiror agree, for themselves and on behalf of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each
indemnification obligation in this Agreement (i) all Losses shall be net of
any insurance (net of any related deductible or expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery) paid or payable to the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the Losses giving rise to any right of
indemnification hereunder, (ii) in no event shall the Indemnifying Party have
liability to the Indemnified Party for any consequential, special, incidental,
indirect, punitive or exemplary damages, lost profits, diminution of value or
similar items (other than any such damages, lost profits, diminution of value
or similar items actually paid to any unaffiliated third party) and (iii) in
no event shall Sellers have any liability or obligation to any Acquiror
Indemnified Party to the extent that any Loss, or portion thereof, as
applicable, for which indemnification is sought hereunder is reflected or
reserved for or otherwise taken into account in determining the Final Purchase
Price.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the event that any fact, event or circumstance allows Acquiror or one of its
Affiliates to seek payment or otherwise results in payment to Acquiror or one
of its Affiliates under the terms of the Amended and Restated Reinsurance
Agreements and such fact, event or circumstance would also constitute a breach
of or inaccuracy in any of Sellers representations or warranties under this
Agreement, Sellers shall have no liability or obligation under this _Article
X_ to any Acquiror Indemnified Party with respect to such breach or
inaccuracy.

 



 

(c) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any
amount in respect of any Loss for which an Indemnifying Party has actually
reimbursed it pursuant to this _Article X_, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after
deducting therefrom the amount of expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of the sum of the amounts previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
claim.

 



 

(d) The parties shall report each indemnification payment made in respect of a
Loss as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal income Tax purposes.

 



 

(e) Any indemnification obligation hereunder with respect to any Loss shall be
calculated after taking into account all reductions in federal, state, local
and foreign Taxes

 



      
 

 



 

(including estimated Taxes) realized by the Indemnified Party as a result of
the event giving rise to such Loss, using reasonable assumptions.

 



 

Section 10.08 _Reserves_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.23_,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the other
Transaction Agreements or any other agreement, document or instrument to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that Sellers make no representation or
warranty with respect to, and nothing contained in this Agreement, any other
Transaction Agreements or in any other agreement, document or instrument to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
is intended or shall be construed to be a representation or warranty (express
or implied) of Sellers, for any purpose of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Agreements or any other agreement, document or instrument to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
with respect to (a) the adequacy or sufficiency of any of the reserves with
respect to the Business, (b) the future experience or profitability of the
Business or (c) the effect of the adequacy or sufficiency of such reserves on
any "line item" or asset, liability or equity amount.

Section 11.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Except as
provided in the following sentences, upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible. Each of the parties expressly acknowledges that
_Sections 5.09_ , _5.10_ and _5.11_ are reasonable and valid in all respects
and irrevocably waives (and irrevocably agrees not to raise) as a defense any
issue of reasonableness (including the reasonableness of the activity
restrictions, territory or the duration and scope of these sections) in any
proceeding to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the intention of the
parties being to provide for the legitimate and reasonable protection of the
interests of Acquiror, Sellers and their respective Affiliates. The parties
have endeavored to limit each Sellers rights to compete to the extent
necessary to protect Acquiror from unfair competition in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
a determination is made that any temporal, territorial or activity-related
restriction on competition contained in this Agreement is too broad to permit
enforcement thereof to its fullest extent, then such restriction shall be
enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and Sellers and Acquiror
hereby consent and agree that _Sections 5.09_ , _5.10_ and

 



      
 

 



 

 _5.11_ may be judicially reformed, revised, modified or partially enforced in
any proceeding brought by Acquiror to enforce this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto and supersede
all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not in conflict with this Agreement,
between or on behalf of Sellers or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Acquiror or its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the subject
matter of the Transaction Agreements.

 



 

Section 11.05 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation
of law or otherwise by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror may assign
its rights hereunder to any of its Affiliates, but no such assignment shall
release Acquiror from any liability or obligation under this Agreement. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 11.05_ shall be void.

 



 

Section 11.06 _Binding Effect; Persons Benefitting_. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns. Except as provided in _Section
5.16_ with respect to DandO Indemnified Persons and _Article X_ with respect to
the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Acquiror Indemnified Parties, this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.07 _Amendment; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by all
the parties hereto. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.

 



 

Section 11.08 _Disclosure Schedules_. Matters reflected in any Section of a
Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in
any Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or
indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement, and
no party shall use the fact of reference to or disclosure of any item or other
matter in a Disclosure Schedule in any dispute as to whether any item or other
matter not disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for the
purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference
to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or
Governmental Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.09 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally:

 



 

(a) submits for itself and its property in any Action arising out of or
relating to the Transaction Agreements, the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, the formation, breach, termination or validity of the
Transaction Agreements or the recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of the Transaction Agreements, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of New York sitting in the County of New York, the court
of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and
appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the foregoing, and
agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and
determined in such New York courts or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such
federal court;

 



 

(b) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue or
jurisdiction of any such Action in any such court or that such Action was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

 



 

(c) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in _Section 11.02_; and

 



 

(d) agrees that nothing in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement
shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner
permitted by the Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall in all respects be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New
York without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles of such state to
the extent such principles would require or permit the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
AGREEMENT, OR ITS PERFORMANCE UNDER OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific wording or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall be
entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief, without any requirement to
post any bond or other undertaking, to prevent or cure breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court referenced in _Section 11.09(a)_ having jurisdiction, such remedy being
in addition to any other remedy to which

 



      
 

 



 

any party may be entitled at law or in equity. The parties agree not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or cure breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by Sellers or Acquiror, as applicable, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
Sellers or Acquiror, as applicable, under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties to each such agreement in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
