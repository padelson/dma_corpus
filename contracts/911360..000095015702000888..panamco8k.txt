Item 5.   Other Events.

     On December 22, 2002, Panamerican Beverages, Inc., a corporation
organized under the laws of the Republic of Panama ("Panamco"), entered into
an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement"), among Cola-Cola
FEMSA, S.A. de C.V., a corporation organized under the laws of the United
Mexican States ("Coca-Cola FEMSA"), Midtown Sub, Inc., a corporation organized
under the laws of the Republic of Panama, and Panamco. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.

     Under the terms of the Merger Agreement:

     (1) Midtown Sub, Inc. will merge into Panamco (the "Merger"), with
Panamco surviving the Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Coca-Cola FEMSA;

     (2) holders of shares of Panamco's Class A Common Stock (other than The
Coca-Cola Company) will receive in the Merger $22 per share in cash; and

     (3) holders of shares of Panamco's Class B Common Stock (other than The
Coca-Cola Company) will receive in the Merger $38 per share in cash; and

     (4) The Coca-Cola Company, which holds 28.5 million shares of Class A
Common Stock, 2.2 million shares of Class B Common Stock, and 2 shares of
Series C Preferred Stock of Panamco, will, instead of cash, receive in the
Merger approximately 304 million unlisted Coca-Cola FEMSA Series D shares in
exchange for its Panamco Class A, Class B and Series C shares.

     The consummation of the Merger is subject to several significant
conditions, including (a) the approval of the Merger by the holders of a
majority of Panamco's Class B shares; (b) the approval of the Merger by
holders of a majority of Panamco's Class A shares that do not own Class B
shares and that cast votes on the matter; (c) the approval of the Merger by
all the holders of Panamco's Series C shares; (d) the securing of financing
and the maintenance of specified credit ratings by Coca-Cola FEMSA; and (e)
customary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

     The transaction will be financed with $2.05 billion of new indebtedness,
for which Coca-Cola FEMSA has received commitments from JPMorgan Chase and
Morgan Stanley.

     Subsidiaries of The Coca-Cola Company and certain other significant
holders of Class B shares, holding in the aggregate a majority of the Class B
shares and all the Series C shares, have entered into stockholder's agreements
pursuant to which they have agreed to vote in favor of the Merger. These
stockholder's agreements are filed hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and 99.4,
respectively.

     The Merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2003,
although no assurance can be given as to whether or when the Merger will
actually be consummated.

     The text of a press release issued by Panamco, Coca-Cola FEMSA and
Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. on December 23, 2002, announcing the
signing of the Merger Agreement is incorporated by reference here in as
Exhibit 99.1.

     Section 2.01. Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or any
holder of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

          (a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub
     shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and

          (iii) in accordance with Section 2.03, one or more Promissory Notes
               (as defined in Section 2.03) that, in the aggregate, entitle the
               holders thereof (which holders shall be restricted to one or more
               of TCCC and its designated Affiliates) to subscribe to
               304,045,678 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Series D
               shares of Parent, no par value (the "Parent Series D Shares"),

               Company, U.S. $.01 par value (the "Company Class C Stock") and
               the aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of Class D
               Preferred Stock of the Company, U.S. $.01 par value ("Company
               Class D Stock") issued pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement with
               TCCC and certain Subsidiaries of TCCC (the "TCCC Stockholders
               Agreement"), (such consideration, the "TCCC Consideration" and,
               together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger
               Consideration").

          (iv) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
               the outstanding Parent Series D Shares are changed into a
               different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
               division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
               split,

               consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
               other similar transaction, or if Parent pays any extraordinary
               dividend or distribution or pays any dividend or distribution in
               kind, then the TCCC Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
               to provide the holders of Promissory Notes with the same economic
               effect as contemplated prior thereto.

     Section 2.02. Stock Options; Restricted Stock. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to cancel, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Stock granted under the Company's Equity Incentive Plan, the Company's
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Stock Option Agreement of Mr.
Cooling, dated November 10, 2000, and the Stock Option Agreement of Mr.
Schimberg, dated November 10, 2000 (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Company Stock Option"), with the holder thereof
becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable income or
employment tax withholding) per share of Company Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Class A Cash Consideration
over (ii) the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, and shall
have no further rights with respect to any such Company Stock Option. Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.02(a) as soon as possible but in any event no later than the
second business day following the Effective Time.

          (b) Each share of Company Class A Stock held by Mr. Cooling and Mr.
     Schimberg (the "Restricted Shareholders") that are subject to the
     restrictions set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreements (as defined
     below) as of the Effective Time (after giving effect to the vesting of a
     portion of such shares at the Effective Time) shall be converted into the
     right to receive Class A Cash Consideration and the Class A Cash
     Consideration to be received upon surrender of the Company Certificates
     representing such shares of Company Class A Stock to the Paying Agent in
     accordance with Section 2.03 shall be deposited into escrow. 31.03% of such
     Class A Consideration held in escrow for the benefit of each Restricted
     Shareholder shall be released to such Restricted Shareholder in the event
     the Average Closing Price (as defined below) equals or exceeds 110.22% of
     the Initial Price (as defined below) on or before November 10, 2005 and any
     and all Class A Consideration held in escrow for the benefit of such
     Restricted Shareholder shall be released to such Restricted Shareholder in
     the event the Average Closing Price equals or exceeds 132.95% of the
     Initial Price on or before November 10, 2006. The Restricted Shareholders
     shall forfeit any of the Class A Cash Consideration remaining in escrow
     after November 10, 2006 and such amount shall be released to Parent. The
     "Initial Price" shall mean the Average Closing Price as of the Closing
     Date. The "Average Closing Price" with respect to any day shall mean the
     average closing price of the Parent's ADS over the 15 consecutive trading
     days immediately preceding such day using the closing prices for the
     Parent's ADS reported in The Wall Street Journal's New York Stock Exchange
     Composite Transactions. The "Restricted Stock Agreements" shall mean the
     Restricted Stock Agreement between the Company and Mr. Schimberg dated
     November 10, 2000 and amended as of March 6, 2002 and the Restricted Stock
     Agreement between the Company and Mr. Cooling dated November 10, 2000 and
     amended as of March 6, 2002.

          (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments
     to the terms of such Company Stock Plans and any related stock option
     agreements and the Restricted Stock Agreements that are necessary to give
     effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.02.

     Section 2.03. Exchange of Company Certificates. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deliver to Merger Sub one or more promissory notes (the
"Promissory Notes") with an aggregate principal amount equal to
U.S.$673,765,224.

          (b) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
     Corporation to deliver the Promissory Notes to the holders of the Company
     Class C Stock and the Company Class D Stock immediately upon such holders'
     surrender to the Surviving Corporation of the certificates evidencing such
     shares of Company Class C Stock and Company Class D Stock. Immediately upon
     surrender of the Promissory Notes for cancellation to Parent, the
     surrendering shareholders (which shall be restricted to one or more of TCCC
     and its designated Affiliates) shall receive from Parent (and Parent shall
     deliver), subject to Section 2.01(c)(iv), 304,045,678 Parent Series D
     Shares. Upon the surrender of the Promissory Notes, the Parent Series D
     Shares shall be delivered in certificated form and shall, unless not
     required under applicable securities Laws (as defined in Section 3.10), be
     stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in the following form:

          (i)  The shares represented by this certificate have not been
               registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
               amended, and may not be transferred, sold or otherwise disposed
               of except pursuant to an effective registration statement or
               pursuant to an exemption from registration under such Act and in
               compliance with all other applicable securities laws.

          (ii) The shares represented by this certificate are subject to
               restrictions on transfer, certain other restrictions, certain
               rights of the shareholders of the Company to purchase such shares
               and certain other rights the terms and conditions of which are
               set forth in the Company's By-Laws [for definitive certificates,
               add the following:

               reproduced on the reverse of this certificate] and the Service
               Agreement, dated June 21, 1993, between the Company and the
               Trustee Division of Banca Serfin, S.A. and the Shareholders
               Agreement dated as of June 21, 1993, as such Agreements may have
               been amended. No transfer of such shares will be made on the
               stock register of the Corporation unless accompanied by evidence
               of compliance with the terms of such By-Laws and Agreements.

     No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Series D Shares or
     book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon cancellation of any
     Promissory Notes. Any holder of a Promissory Note who would otherwise be
     entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent




                                       5
<PAGE>


     Series D Share shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon
     surrender of such holder's Promissory Note(s), be paid an amount in cash
     (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying such
     fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account
     all fractional share interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be
     entitled by U.S.$2.22.

          (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to Merger Sub
     cash equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration and shall designate a bank
     or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as an agent
     (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Cash Consideration in
     accordance with Sections 2.01(c)(i) and 2.01(c)(ii) upon surrender of
     certificates formerly representing shares of Company Class A Stock and
     Company Class B Stock (the "Company Certificates"). Parent shall take all
     steps necessary to enable, and shall cause, the Surviving Corporation to
     deliver to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Company
     Certificates immediately following the Effective Time cash sufficient to
     pay the aggregate Cash Consideration (such cash being referred to
     hereinafter as the "Exchange Fund").

          (d) Promptly following the Effective Time but in no event later than
     five days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
     Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate (i) a form
     of letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be
     effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Stock shall
     pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying
     Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other
     provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (the "Letter of Transmittal"),
     (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such shares of Company
     Class A Stock and Company Class B Stock in exchange for the Cash
     Consideration, and (iii) applicable tax forms with respect to withholding
     any amounts from the Cash Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company
     Certificate to the Paying Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal,
     duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto and
     such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
     holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
     therefor the amount of cash which the Company Class A Stock or Company
     Class B Stock formerly represented by such Certificate shall have converted
     into pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
     the Cash Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares
     of Company Class A Stock which are not registered in the transfer records
     of the Company, a check for the Class A Cash Consideration may be issued
     with respect to such shares of Company Class A Stock to such a transferee
     if the Company Certificate representing such Company Class A Stock is
     presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
     evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
     transfer taxes have been paid.

     Section 2.04. No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. All Promissory
Notes issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued
or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to shares of Company
Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article II, each Company
Certificate and each certificate representing Company Class C Stock and Company
Class D Stock shall be deemed at any time after the




                                       6
<PAGE>


Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (i)
the Class A Cash Consideration, (ii) the Class B Cash Consideration or (iii) the
TCCC Consideration. All shares of Company Stock when so converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
canceled and retired.

     Section 2.05. Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Certificates six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the
instruction of Parent and any holders of Company Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation and Parent for the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01 as general creditors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent.

     Section 2.06. No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Company Certificates or certificates representing Company
Class C Stock or Company Class D Stock shall not have been surrendered prior to
five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.09(a)), any such
Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

     Section 2.07. Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation. If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund is
inadequate to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable hereunder, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall in any event, subject to Section 2.06 (No
Liability), be liable for payment thereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

     Section 2.08. Lost Company Certificates. If any Company Certificate or
certificate representing Company Class C Stock or Company Class D Stock shall
have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate or certificate
representing Company Class C Stock or Company Class D Stock to be lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Company Certificate or certificate representing Company Class C
Stock or Company Class D Stock, the Paying Agent or Merger Sub, as the case may
be, will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Company
Certificate or certificate representing Company Class C Stock or Company Class D
Stock the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Stock formerly represented thereby in each case, pursuant to this Agreement.

     Section 2.09. Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (x) from the
Cash Consideration




                                       7
<PAGE>


otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
Stock or Restricted Company Stock and (y) from any amount otherwise payable with
respect to any Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.02, such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code (as defined in Section 10.11(e)) and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to or deposited with the
appropriate taxing authority by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Company Stock, Restricted Company Stock or Company Stock Options in respect to
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

     Section 2.10. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets deemed acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

     Section 2.11. Stock Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly
representing Company Stock entitled to convert into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Paying Agent for any reason, such certificates shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

                                  Article III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     Except as set forth (i) in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section
3.04(a)); (ii) in the section of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company
to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Letter") that specifically relates to the correspondingly numbered Section and
subsection of this Article III or (iii) in any other section of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent that the relation between the disclosure and the
numbered Section and subsection of this Article III is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure, the Company hereby represents and warrants to each
of Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

     Section 3.01. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) The Company
and each of its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 10.11(h)) is a
corporation or legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and, except to
the extent it has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as




                                       8
<PAGE>


defined in Section 10.11(f)) on the Company, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have all requisite corporate, partnership or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
businesses as now conducted.

          (b) Section 3.01(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
     list of all Subsidiaries of the Company that would be required to be listed
     in accordance with paragraph (b)(21) of Item 601 of Regulation S-K of the
     U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in an exhibit to an
     annual report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC, assuming the
     fiscal year covered by such report ended on the date of this Agreement

          (c) The Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries is duly
     qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
     jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
     nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
     licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or
     licensed and in good standing has not had, and would not reasonably be
     expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
     Effect on the Company.

          (d) The Company has heretofore delivered or made available to Parent
     accurate and complete copies of the articles or certificate of
     incorporation and by-laws or other similar organizational documents, as

Agreement, the Required Company Votes). All resolutions of the Company Board
described above were approved by all directors other than Mr. Fayard (who did
not participate) and Mr. Schimberg (who abstained). In addition, with respect to
a resolution to determine that the agreement of merger contained in this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and fair
to, and in the best interests of, the holders of the Company Class A Stock,
other than TCCC and its Subsidiaries, all directors (other than Mr. Fayard (who
did not participate), Mr. Schimberg (who abstained) and all other directors who
hold shares of Company Class B Stock (who abstained)) voted in favor. This
Agreement and the Stockholder Agreements to which the Company is a party have
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitute a
valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with their terms.

          (b) The Company Board has directed that the agreement of merger

     Class B Stock and the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
     holders of all outstanding shares of Company Class C Stock (together, the
     "Required Company Votes") are the only votes of the holders of any class or
     series of capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt the agreement of
     merger contained within this Agreement and to ask the holders of the
     Company Class A Stock to approve the agreement of merger contained in this
     Agreement. No other vote or approval of the stockholders of the Company is
     required by Panama Law or the Company Articles and the Amended and Restated
     By-Laws of the Company, dated as of May 3, 2002 (together with the Company
     Articles, each as currently in effect, the "Company Organizational
     Documents"), in order for the Company to approve and adopt the agreement of
     merger contained within this Agreement, and to ask the holders of the
     Company Class A Stock to approve the agreement of merger contained in this
     Agreement, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by any

          (c) The Company Board, after due inquiry and discussion, determined
     that Messrs. Jung, Furlan and Postl (the "Specified Directors") do not have
     any conflict that may impair their judgment with respect to the approval of
     the resolution described in the penultimate sentence of Section 3.03(a). In
     approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
     Board took into account discussions between the Specified Directors and
     major holders of shares of Company Class B Stock (other than TCCC and its
     Subsidiaries) regarding the allocation of the Cash Consideration between
     the shares of Company Class A Stock and the shares of Company Class B
     Stock.

Decree, and this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreements, the Merger and the other

     Section 4.04. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the
SEC or mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time immediately following
any amendment or supplement thereto or at the time the Company Stockholder
Meeting is held, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Transaction Statement (other than portions of the
Transaction Statement attributable to the Company) will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no
representations regarding any information with respect to the Company that is in
conformity with information furnished in writing by the Company specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Transaction Statement. The
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub or any other person deemed to
constitute part of the "offeror" in the Declaration, when the Declaration was
delivered to the Company and on the date of this Agreement, is true, correct and
complete in all material respects, and does not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein,
in each case as and only to the extent required by the Decree.

     Section 4.05. Ownership of Company Stock. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their respective subsidiaries

action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub,
which questions the validity of or in any material way challenges this Agreement
or any Stockholder Agreement or any action to be taken by Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
by any Stockholder Agreement or that seeks to prevent or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Stockholder Agreement.

Parent funds pursuant to (i) two term loan facilities and (ii) a bridge loan
facility ((the "Bank Commitments"), pursuant to a letter agreement dated the
date hereof (the "Commitment Letter"), and together with the FEMSA Commitment,
the "Commitments") and such Commitments are in full force and effect and have
not been amended or rescinded. As of the Closing Date, if U.S.$2.31 billion is
disbursed on and subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitments, then
such disbursement shall be sufficient to permit Parent and Merger Sub to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration, to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement, each Stockholder Agreement and the Commitments. To the knowledge of
Parent on the date hereof (based exclusively on its conversations with the

warranties of the Company set forth in Article III) as

Sub or any of their Affiliates.

(B) access by Parent and Merger Sub and their authorized representatives and the
prospective lenders to Parent and Merger Sub (and their counsel and advisors) to
competitively sensitive information shall be restricted to those persons who
have a need to know such information for due diligence and integration planning
purposes. If any material information is withheld from Parent, Merger Sub and/or
their prospective lenders pursuant to the last proviso to the preceding
sentence, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
waivers or consents from third parties necessary to provide such confidential
information to Parent, Merger Sub and/or their prospective lenders or to
implement procedures so that privileged information may be provided to Parent,
Merger Sub and/or their prospective lenders without prejudicing the privilege
pertaining to such information.

          (b) Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company shall
     furnish to Parent, concurrently with the delivery thereof to the Chief
     Executive Officer of the




                                       34

     Company, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company or the Company Board,
     such definitive quarterly and monthly financial data as are prepared for
     distribution to such an executive or the Company Board, as the case may be.

          (c) Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company shall
     furnish to Parent, a copy of all filings made by the Company with the
     National Securities Commission of the Republic of Panama (to the extent not
     filed with the SEC). (d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and will
     cause its authorized representatives to hold (including the prospective
     lenders to Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel and advisors) in
     confidence all documents and information concerning the Company and its
     Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the
     Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and the Company in effect as of
     the date hereof (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

          (e) Notwithstanding any provision in Section 6.02(a), the Company will
     make available, as promptly as possible to Parent true and complete copies
     of (i) all material Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
     preceding three taxable years and (ii) any material audit report issued
     within the last three years (or otherwise with respect to any audit or
     proceeding in progress) relating to Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary.

     Section 6.03. Parent Covenants. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement or as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter, prior to the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries will, without the
prior written consent of the Company take, propose to take, or agree in writing
or otherwise to take, any action which (a) would make the representations or
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement, when made or on and as of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, which need be true
and correct only as of the specified date) (i) which are qualified as to
materiality, untrue or incorrect or (ii) which are not so qualified, untrue in
any material respect or (b) would be reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VIII hereof not being satisfied.

use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto and to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be filed with the SEC and to be mailed to the Company's

Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on
the other hand, with respect thereto. Parent shall reasonably promptly provide
any information or responses to comments, or other assistance, reasonably
requested in connection with the foregoing. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy

of the SEC with respect thereto (orally or in writing), the Company (i) shall
provide Parent and its counsel an opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and (ii) shall give reasonable consideration to all
comments proposed by Parent or its counsel.

immediately prior to the Effective Time, deliver to the permitted designees of
TCCC under the TCCC Stockholders Agreement a number of nonassessable shares of
Company Class D Stock required pursuant to the TCCC Stockholders Agreement in
exchange for all shares of Company Class A Stock and Company Class B Stock held

and the Merger by the holders of the majority of outstanding Company Class A
Stock present or represented by proxy at such meeting, that are not Disqualified
Holders (such approval, together with the Required Company Votes, the "Company
Stockholder Approvals"). Except as otherwise permitted by Section 7.04, the
Company Board shall recommend approval of this Agreement and include in the
Proxy Statement such recommendation. "Disqualified Holders" means TCCC and its
Subsidiaries, Venbottling and its Subsidiaries, the officers and directors of
the Company, and any other Person whom the secretary of the Company (or other
officer or agent of the Company authorized to tabulate votes) is advised
beneficially owns shares of Company Class B Stock.

     Section 7.03. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other Parties to this Agreement in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable





                                       36
<PAGE>


Laws to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Stockholder Agreement as promptly as practicable, including (i)
defending all lawsuits and proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order or injunction vacated and reversed;
(ii) taking of actions necessary to cause the conditions precedent in Article
VIII to be satisfied, including, as necessary, to avoid any suit, claim,
investigation, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity; and (iii)
obtaining all necessary consents, approvals and waivers from third parties. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make or
cause to be made an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and all filings that are advisable or required by
applicable Antitrust Law, foreign investment Law or other Laws in the Republic
of Panama, the Federative Republic of Brazil, the United Mexican States and
other countries with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or any
Stockholder Agreement as promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this Section 7.03
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act or such other Laws as soon as practicable.

          (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the
     efforts referenced in Section 7.03(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and
     authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
     the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law or any foreign investment Law, use
     its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with the other
     Party in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
     any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
     private party; and (ii) notify the other Party promptly following the
     receipt of any material communication received by such Party from, or given
     by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of
     the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity and of any
     communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
     private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
     hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman
     Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal
     Trade Commission Act, as amended, applicable antitrust Laws in the
     Federative Republic of Brazil, the United Mexican States and the Republic
     of Venezuela and all other Laws in any other jurisdiction in which the
     Company or its Subsidiaries operate that are designed or intended to
     prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
     monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
     merger or acquisition.

          (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
     Parties contained in Sections 7.03(a) and 7.03(b), each of Parent and the
     Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections,
     if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Entity or other Person with
     respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or
     any foreign investment Law. In connection with the foregoing, if any
     administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding
     by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
     challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
     any Antitrust Law or any foreign





                                       37
<PAGE>

     investment Law, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
     all respects with the other Party and use its respective reasonable best
     efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
     vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
     other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
     and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
     provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 7.03 shall (i) limit a
     Party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or
     9.02(c) so long as such Party has theretofore complied in all material
     respects with its obligations under this Section 7.03, (ii) require Parent
     to agree to any conditions which would impose (A) any limitations on
     Parent's ownership or operation of all or any portion of its, any of its
     Subsidiaries', or the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business or
     assets, or to compel Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or
     hold separate all or any portion of its, any of its Subsidiaries' or the
     Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business or assets, (B) any
     limitations on the ability of Parent to acquire or hold or to exercise full
     rights of ownership of the Company Stock, (C) any obligations on Parent or
     any of its Subsidiaries or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
     maintain facilities, operations, places of business, employment levels,
     products or businesses or (D) any other obligation, restriction,
     limitation, qualification or other conditions, which, in the case of any of
     clauses (A) through (D) above, would, individually or in the aggregate, be
     reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent, have a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or materially impair the benefits
     sought to be derived from the Merger, (iii) require the Company to agree to
     any material dispositions, limitations, consents, commitments, agreements
     or other material actions, other than any of the foregoing that in each
     such case may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger (or permit
     the Company to agree to any of the foregoing even if so conditioned if such
     actions would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
     have a material adverse effect on Parent, have a Material Adverse Effect on
     the Company, or materially impair the benefits sought to be derived from
     the Merger) or (iv) require any party to agree to pay or pay at any time
     any material amounts (other than the applicable Merger Consideration to be
     paid at the Closing and other than any amount required to be paid under
     existing contractual arrangements or contractual arrangements permitted by
     Section 6.01) to one or more stockholders of the Company in connection with
     the Merger.

          (d) The Company further agrees to cooperate with Parent in arranging
     for such pay-off letters from bank lenders to the Company and its
     Subsidiaries, as are reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
     Parent's plans for refinancing debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries at
     the Closing.

          (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its
     Subsidiaries to seek or obtain any debt or equity financing or investment
     from any Person, or require any Person to make such financing or investment
     available, other than as expressly set forth in Section 7.13.

     Section 7.04. Acquisition Proposals. (a) The Company will not, and it will
cause its Subsidiaries and each officer, director or employee of, and any
investment banker,




                                       38
<PAGE>

attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section
10.11(a)); (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to or in connection with, or
take any other action to facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries
or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) enter into any binding or non-binding
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) amend or grant any
waiver, exemption or release with respect to any of the restrictions under the
Company Organizational Documents, that would in any way facilitate an
Acquisition Proposal or amend or grant any waiver or release or with respect to
the limitation on ownership of shares of Company Class A Stock, the limitation
on the transfer of Company Class B Stock without triggering conversion to
Company Class A Stock, or the Conversion Number (as defined in the Company
Organizational Documents); provided that, nothing contained in this Section
7.04(a) shall prohibit the Company Board from furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent
that (A) the Company Board (including the affirmative vote of the majority of
the independent directors), reasonably determines in good faith that such action
is necessary for the Company Board to comply with its duties under applicable
Law to act in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, (B) the Company
Board (including the affirmative vote of the majority of the independent
directors) reasonably determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal,
if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the identity
of the Person making the proposal, and believes in good faith, after
consultation with and taking into account the advice of an independent,
nationally recognized financial advisor, would, if consummated, result in a
transaction more favorable to the Company's stockholders taken as a whole from a
financial point of view than the Merger (any such Acquisition Proposal
satisfying clauses (A) and (B) being referred to herein as a "Superior
Proposal"), and (C) prior to taking such action, the Company (x) provides five
Business Days' prior written notice to Parent to the effect that it is proposing
to take such action, together with the applicable information specified in the
next sentence, and (y) receives from such Person an executed confidentiality and
standstill agreement in reasonably customary form. The Company shall notify
Parent of any Acquisition Proposal or request for information by any Person who
is considering making an Acquisition Proposal (including all material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the Person making it) as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours) after its receipt thereof, and
shall promptly provide Parent with a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or
amendments or supplements thereto, and shall thereafter inform Parent on a
current basis of the status of any inquiries, discussions or negotiations with
such third party, and any material changes to the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly give Parent a copy of any information
delivered to such Person which has not previously been reviewed by Parent.
Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any possible Acquisition Proposal and shall notify each such Person, whom it,
or any officer, director, investment advisor, financial advisor, attorney or
other representative retained by it, has had discussions with during the 60 days
prior





                                       39
<PAGE>

to the date of this Agreement, that the Company Board no longer seeks or
requests the making of any Acquisition Proposal, withdraws any consent
theretofore given to the making of an Acquisition Proposal and requests the
return of all confidential information provided by the Company to any such
Party.

          (b) The Company Board will not withdraw, modify or amend, or propose
     to withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent, its
     recommendation that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the Merger
     (or publicly announce any intention to do so) unless (i) the Company has
     fully complied with the terms of Section 7.04(a), (ii) an unsolicited bona
     fide written Superior Proposal is pending at the time the Company Board
     determines to take any such action, (iii) the Company Board (including the
     affirmative vote of the majority of the independent directors), reasonably
     determines in good faith that such action is necessary for the Company
     Board to comply with its duties under applicable Law to act in the best
     interests of the Company's stockholders and (iv) at least five Business
     Days before such action by the Company Board, the Company shall have
     delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends
     to take such action, together with the applicable information specified in
     the penultimate sentence of Section 7.04(a) (and provided opportunities to
     Parent to submit revised proposals to it during this period of at least
     five Business Days). Any such withdrawal, amendment or modification of the
     recommendation shall not (i) change the adoption of this Agreement or any
     other approval of the Company Board in any respect that would have the
     effect of causing the threshold restrictions on Company Stock ownership
     under any Takeover Statute to be applicable to the transactions
     contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or the transactions contemplated
     by the Stockholder Agreement, or (ii) change the obligation of the Company
     to present this Agreement for approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting
     on the earliest practicable date. At any such meeting following any
     withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Company's recommendation of
     this Agreement, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders
     without a positive recommendation (although the adoption of this Agreement
     by the Company Board may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the
     Company Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a positive
     recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
     amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law. Nothing
     contained in this Section 7.04 shall prohibit the Company from taking and
     disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
     Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

          (c) Nothing in this Section 7.04 shall (i) permit the Company to
     terminate this Agreement (except as provided in Article IX) or (ii) affect
     any other obligations of the Company under this Agreement.

     Section 7.05. Public Announcements. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, will consult with the other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement, except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement.





                                       40

     Section 7.06. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a)
Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in favor of the current or
former directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents or in any agreement listed in Section 7.06 of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms from the Effective Time until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions.

          (b) Without limiting the Company's obligations under Section 7.12, for
     a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
     maintained in effect the policies of directors' and officers' liability
     insurance maintained by the Company for the benefit of those persons who
     are covered by such policies at the Effective Time (or Parent may
     substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage) with respect to
     matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, to the extent that such
     liability insurance can be maintained at a cost to Parent not greater than
     250 percent of the annual premium applicable to the June 2002 - June 2003
     period (as of the date of this Agreement) for the current Company
     directors' and officers' liability insurance as set forth in Section 7.06
     of the Company Disclosure Letter; provided that, if such insurance cannot
     be so maintained or obtained at such costs, Parent shall cause the
     Surviving Corporation to maintain or obtain as much of such insurance as
     can be so maintained or obtained at a cost equal to 250 percent of the
     annual premium of the Company for such insurance applicable to the June
     2002 - June 2003 period (as of the date of this Agreement).

          (c) Without limiting the obligations of Parent pursuant to this
     Section 7.06, it is understood that Parent may elect to cause the Surviving
     Corporation to change the jurisdiction of its incorporation after the
     Closing.

     Section 7.07. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall, upon
obtaining knowledge of any of the following, give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent or Merger Sub shall, upon obtaining knowledge of any of the following,
give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any
event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement, which is
qualified as to materiality, to be untrue or inaccurate, or any representation
or warranty of such Party not so qualified, to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any material failure
of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder, (iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or
non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause any condition to the
obligations of any Party to effect the transactions contemplated hereby not to
be satisfied, (iv) any notice or other written or material oral communication
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, (v) any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or other proceedings (or communications indicating
that the same may be contemplated) commenced or threatened against the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries which, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.12 (Litigation) or which relate to the
consummation of the Merger or (vi) any notice or other written communication
from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be





                                       41
<PAGE>

required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall
not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the rights
or remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

     Section 7.08. SEC Filings. The Company shall furnish to Parent copies of
all forms, reports, certifications and other documents which it files with the
SEC pursuant to Section 13(a), 14(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Regulations 13A, 14A, 14C and
Rules 15d-1 through 15d-21, on or after the date hereof, and the Company
warrants that, as of the respective dates thereof, such reports and other
documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in
such reports (including the related notes) will comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, will be prepared in
conformity with U.S. GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis (except as specifically indicated in the notes thereto), and on
that basis fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

     Section 7.09. Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 9.05 (Effect of
Termination and Abandonment), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
Expenses and Transfer Taxes (as defined in this Section 7.09) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, shall be paid by the Person incurring such Expenses or
Transfer Taxes (including by withholding or deduction from any payment hereunder
to such Person by a payor on behalf of such Person). The Company shall cooperate
with Merger Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns
with respect to any Transfer Taxes incurred by any of the Parties hereto. As
used in this Agreement, (i) "Expenses" includes all out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to a Party and its Affiliates) incurred by a Party or on
its behalf in connection with, or related to, the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the preparation, filing, printing and mailing of
the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other
matters related to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) "Transfer
Taxes" means all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp,
recording and other similar Taxes (including interest penalties and additions to
any such Taxes).

     Section 7.10. Antitakeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or any Stockholder Agreement, each of Parent and
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Stockholder Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and by any
Stockholder Agreement and otherwise act to




                                       42
<PAGE>

minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Stockholder Agreement.

     Section 7.11. Director Resignations. On the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause to be delivered to Parent duly executed resignations, effective as of the
Effective Time, of each member of the Company Board and shall take such other
action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

     Section 7.12. Employee Matters. (a) Parent shall honor and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, the
Company Plans disclosed on Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event) ; provided, however, that, subject to Sections 7.12(b) and (c), nothing
herein is intended to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to amend or terminate any such plans, programs, policies or arrangements in
accordance with their terms and nothing herein shall be interpreted to require
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue the Company Stock Plans.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, and for the avoidance of doubt, Parent
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to,
amend, modify or terminate the Company's Key Executive Severance, Retention and
Non-Competition Plan and the Company's Key Employee Severance, Retention and
Non-Competition Plan in any manner adverse to individuals who are participants
in such plans on the date hereof and who are still participants immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

          (b) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective
     Time and ending on the later of (i) the first anniversary of the Effective
     Time or (ii) December 31, 2004, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
     to provide compensation, bonus opportunity and employee benefits (excluding
     any benefits attributable to equity based plans) to employees of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries whose primary work location is in the United
     States of America immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "U.S.
     Employees") that are substantially similar in value in the aggregate to
     those provided to the U.S. Employees immediately prior to the Effective
     Time and determined based on the information made available to Parent by
     the Company.

          (c) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual
     other than benefit accrual under severance and vacation plans) under the
     employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the
     Surviving Corporation) providing benefits to any employees of the Company
     and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Affected
     Employees") following the Effective Time, each Affected Employee shall be
     credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
     Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Effective
     Time, to the same extent as such Affected Employee was entitled before the
     Effective Time to credit for such service under any similar employee
     benefit plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to the same extent
     that similarly situated employees of the Parent or its Subsidiaries receive
     credit for past service under such plans. The foregoing provision shall not
     effect any Affected Employees' benefits accrued under any Company Plan
     prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
     shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition
     limitation under any welfare benefit





                                       43
<PAGE>

     plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Affected
     Employees and their eligible dependents participate (except to the extent
     that such pre-existing condition limitation would have been applicable
     under the comparable Company welfare benefit plans immediately prior to the
     Effective Time) and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any
     co-payments and deductibles incurred prior to the Effective Time (or such
     earlier or later transition date to new welfare benefits plans) occurs, in
     satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
     any welfare benefit plans in which Affected Employees participate after the
     Effective Time in respect of the plan year which such deductible or
     co-payment applies.

          (d) Nothing provided herein shall affect in any way the Parent and
     Surviving Corporation's ability to terminate the employment of any Affected
     Employee at any time.

     Section 7.13. Financing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the financing in accordance with, and subject to, the Commitments (the
"Financing"). Without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not
amend any material term of the Commitments in a way that would adversely affect
the Company. Parent shall not terminate the mandate letter referenced in the
Commitment Letter. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in its efforts
to satisfy its obligations under this Section 7.13, including, assisting Parent
in the preparation of any documentation relating to the Financing, and granting
any guarantees and security interests required for the Financing that are
effective only from and after the Effective Time; provided that, neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to pay any commitment or similar
fees prior to the Effective Time.

     Section 7.14. Standstill. If this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 9.03(c) or by Parent pursuant to Section 9.02(a) at a time
when the conditions in Sections 8.02(e) and 8.02(f) have not both been satisfied
or waived (and the failure of such conditions to have been satisfied is not, in
either case, due to a breach of this Agreement by the Company) and the only
other condition, if any, in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 that would not be satisfied
at such time is Section 8.02(c) (such a termination, a "Financing Termination"),
the time period referenced in the first sentence of paragraph 7 of the
Confidentiality Agreement will be extended until May 14, 2005.

                    correct in all respects, unless the failure of such
                    representation or warranty, together with the failure of all
                    other representations and warranties in the same Section, to

          (b) The Company shall have performed or complied in all material
     respects with all covenants and agreements contained herein required to be

     Company (or an effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries that, were such effect

                    if such representation or warranty shall fail to be true and
                    correct in all respects, unless the failure of all such
                    representations and warranties to be true and correct has
                    not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
                    individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
                    on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its
                    obligations under this Agreement.

          (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in all
     material respects with all covenants and agreements contained herein

                    consummate, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal; or

               (ii) (A) on or after the date hereof and at or before the
                    termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall
                    have been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
                    any of its stockholders or any Person shall have publicly
                    announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make

                    of its Subsidiaries, (B) this Agreement is terminated by
                    either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or
                    by Parent pursuant to Section 9.04(b)(ii) and (C) within 15
                    months of such termination, the Company enters into an
                    agreement to consummate, or consummates, any Acquisition
                    Proposal; or

               (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
                    Section 9.03(b);

     then the Company shall (A) pay Parent a termination fee of
     U.S.$125,000,000.00 (one hundred and twenty-five million dollars) in
     same-day funds, on (x) the date the Company terminates this Agreement
     pursuant to Section 9.03(b) (and such termination shall not be effective
     until such payment has been made in full), or (y) in the case of a
     termination contemplated in Section 9.05(b)(i) or Section 9.05(b)(ii), the

     consummation of any Acquisition Proposal, and (B) reimburse all Expenses of
     Parent and Merger Sub not in excess of U.S.$15,000,000. Solely for the
     purposes of this Section 9.05, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have
     the meaning set forth in Section 10.11(a) except that (A) the term
     "material portion" in clause (ii) of such definition shall not be deemed to
     apply to less than 25% of the assets or operations of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, provided that, without intending to raise
     the minimum threshold for what constitutes a "material portion," it is
     understood that, for purposes of Section 9.05 and for all other purposes,
     substantially all of the assets or operations of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries located in Mexico shall at all times constitute a "material
     portion"; (B) all references to 15% in clause (iii) of such definition
     shall be deemed to be references to 35% and (C) clause (iii)(C) of such
     definition shall be deemed deleted. The Company acknowledges that the
     agreements contained in this Section 9.05(b) are an integral part of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
     agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this
     Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amounts
     due pursuant to this Section 9.05(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
     Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for
     the fee and Expenses set forth in this Section 9.05(b), the Company shall
     pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in

     to time during such period plus two percent (2%). Acceptance by Parent of
     the fee due under this Section 9.05(b) shall constitute acceptance by
     Parent of the validity of any termination of this Agreement.

          (c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
     pursuant to a Financing Termination, then the Parent shall (i) pay the
     Company a termination fee of U.S.$125,000,000.00 (one hundred and
     twenty-five million dollars) in same-day funds within five Business Days of
     the date of such termination and (ii) reimburse all Expenses of the Company
     not in excess of U.S.$15,000,000. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
     the agreements contained in this Section 9.05(c) are an integral part of
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
     agreements, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement;
     accordingly, if Parent and Merger Sub fail to promptly pay the amounts due
     pursuant to this Section 9.05(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, the
     Company commences a suit which results in a judgment against Parent for the
     fee and the reimbursement of the Expenses set forth in this Section
     9.05(c), Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including
     attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest from
     the date of termination of this Agreement on the amounts owned at the prime
     rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time during such period plus

     Section 9.05(c) shall constitute acceptance by the Company of the validity
     of any termination of this Agreement.

     Section 9.06. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or after approval of the
Merger by the Company Stockholder Approvals but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which requires the approval of the stockholders of the
Company or Parent under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all the Parties.

     Section 9.07. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each Party (for these purposes, Parent and Merger Sub shall together be deemed
one Party and the Company shall be deemed the other Party) may (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
Party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other Party contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the other Party with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
either Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of
either Party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided,
however, that, if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to a
Financing Termination, the terms of Section 7.14 shall be deemed to amend

     assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and

     Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
     inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their

or adverse modification by the Company Board of its approval or recommendation
of the Merger or the Merger Agreement or (e) the time at which the Merger
Agreement is no longer in full force and effect in accordance with its terms on

arising hereunder before such termination, and provided, further, that the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 8
of this Agreement and of the Company set forth in Section 9 of this Agreement,
and the provisions of Sections 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 shall survive any such
termination if the Effective Time occurs.

     SECTION 11. Shareholder Capacity. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary:

     (a) No director, officer, partner, member, employee or designee of either
Shareholder who is or becomes, during the term hereof a director or officer of
the Company makes any representation, warranty, undertaking or agreement herein
in his or her capacity as such a director or officer.

     (b) Each Shareholder has entered into this Agreement solely in such
Shareholder's capacity as the Beneficial Owner of Covered Shares and nothing
herein shall limit or affect any actions taken or omitted to be taken at any
time by any director, officer, partner, member, employee or designee, as
applicable, of such Shareholder in his or her capacity as an officer or director
of the Company.

     (c) Neither Shareholder shall have any liability to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates under this Agreement or
otherwise as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by any
director, officer, partner, member, employee or designee, as applicable, of such
Shareholder in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company.

     SECTION 12. Business Indemnification. (a) After the Effective Time, Parent
(in such capacity, the "Indemnifying Party") agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Shareholder Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses
(other than Losses with respect to the value of the Existing Investment) that
arise out of or are based upon:

          (i) the existence in any form, report, certification or document
     required to be filed by Parent with the SEC from and after January 1, 2000
     and prior to the date of this Agreement, including any information,
     financial statements, exhibits or schedules included or incorporated by
     reference therein (the "Parent SEC Reports"), when filed (or, if amended,
     superseded or supplemented by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
     then on the date of such filing), of any untrue statement of a material
     fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated or
     incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
     statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
     made, not misleading;

          (ii) the failure, in any material respect, of the consolidated
     financial statements (including the related notes) of Parent included (or
     incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports filed with the SEC
     since January 1, 2002, when filed (or, if amended, superseded or
     supplemented by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the
     date of


                                       12
<PAGE>


     such filing) to (x) comply as to form in all material respects with
     applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
     of the SEC applicable with respect thereto, (y) have been prepared in
     conformity with Mexican GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited interim
     financial statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the
     SEC), applied on a consistent basis (except as specifically indicated in
     the notes thereto), or (z) have fairly presented the consolidated financial
     position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
     thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
     periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial
     statements, to normal year-end adjustments); or

          (iii) except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports, any liabilities
     or obligations, as of the date hereof, of Parent and its Subsidiaries of
     any nature, whether or not accrued, absolute, contingent, liquidated or
     unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to become due and whether or not
     required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under Mexican GAAP,
     except liabilities or obligations which have not had, and would not
     reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
     material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial
     condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     (b) Any amounts paid under Section 12(a) shall not exceed U.S.$673,765,224.
No claim for indemnification under this Section 12(a) may be made by the
Shareholder Indemnified Parties unless notice of such claim is provided to
Parent during a period of two years following the Effective Time. No claim for
indemnification under Section 12(a) may be made with respect to matters recorded
in the minutes of the meetings of the Parent Board prior to the date of this
Agreement.

     SECTION 13. Transaction Indemnification. After the Effective Time, the
Indemnifying Party hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder
Indemnified Parties against and from all Losses that any such Shareholder
Indemnified Party incurs as a result of any Action, insofar as such Losses arise
as a result of, or with respect to, (i) any breach of fiduciary duties by
members of the Company Board or the Parent Board in connection with the approval
of the Merger, the Merger Agreement, this Agreement, the other Stockholders
Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby or (ii) any untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Proxy Statement (including any
amendments or supplements thereto) or any omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, that, (x) the Indemnifying Party shall not have
any liability under clause (i) above to the extent such Losses are found by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by any willful or
intentional conduct of any Shareholder Indemnified Party, (y) the Indemnifying
Party shall not have any liability under clause (ii) above with respect to any
information furnished by any Shareholder Indemnified Party for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, and (z) for purposes of this Section 13, Losses shall not
include any Losses in value with respect to the capital stock of Parent owned by
any Shareholder Indemnified Party.

     SECTION 14. Indemnification Procedures. (a) If any Action is instituted for
which a Shareholder Indemnified Party intends to claim any Losses in accordance
with Section 12 or Section 13, such Shareholder Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of such Action. The failure of a Shareholder
Indemnified Party to give any notice required


                                       13
<PAGE>


by this Section shall not affect any Shareholder Indemnified Party's rights
under this Section except to the extent such failure is actually prejudicial to
the rights or obligations of the Indemnifying Party.

     (b) If a claim made pursuant to Section 12 or Section 13 arises out of the
claim of any third party, or if there is any claim against a third party
available by virtue of the circumstances relating thereto, the Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice referred to above
to notify the Shareholder Indemnified Party that it elects to conduct and
control such action. If the Indemnifying Party does not give the foregoing
notice, the Shareholder Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend,
contest and, subject to the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise such
action in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, and the Indemnifying Party
shall, upon request from the Shareholder Indemnified Party, promptly pay to such
Shareholder Indemnified Party, in accordance with the other terms of Section 12
or 13, the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided hereunder.
If the Indemnifying Party gives the foregoing notice, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its
own choosing and at its sole expense, the conduct and settlement of such action
and the Shareholder Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in connection therewith; provided, however, that (a) the Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the consent of the affected Shareholder Indemnified
Party, enter into any settlement the effect of which is to create or impose any
lien upon any of the properties or assets of such Shareholder Indemnified Party;
(b) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to any settlement without the prior
written consent of the affected Shareholder Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (c) the Indemnifying Party shall
not enter into any settlement the effect of which is to permit any injunction,
declaratory judgment or other nonmonetary relief to be entered against any
Shareholder Indemnified Party; (d) the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Shareholder Indemnified Party to participate in such conduct or settlement
through counsel chosen by the Shareholder Indemnified Party, with the fees and
expenses of such counsel borne by the Shareholder Indemnified Party unless under
then applicable standards of professional conduct a conflict would exist, or be
reasonably foreseeable to arise, between the Indemnifying Party, on the one
hand, and the Shareholder Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, in which event
such fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party,
but under no circumstance shall the Indemnifying Party be required to pay the
expenses of more than one such separate counsel in connection with such claim;
and (e) the Indemnifying Party shall agree promptly to reimburse the Shareholder
Indemnified Party for the full amount of any Losses resulting from such action
(except for expenses borne by the Shareholder Indemnified Party pursuant to
clause (d) hereof) incurred by the Shareholder Indemnified Party, including
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel for the Shareholder
Indemnified Party.

     SECTION 15. Tax Treatment of the Transaction. (a) It is the intent of the
parties hereto that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
this Agreement will qualify as nontaxable transactions under Section 351 of the
Code and as nontaxable transactions to the parties hereto under the Laws of
Mexico and Panama. Parent (and, as applicable, FEMSA) will take all of the
following actions in order that the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement will be nontaxable under Section 351 of the Code:



                                       14
<PAGE>


          (i) Parent will take all action necessary to cause the organizational
     documents of Parent to be amended prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting
     to provide the holders of the Parent Series L Shares with the right to
     elect two directors to the Parent Board;

          (ii) Parent and FEMSA will cause all equity financing (the "Equity
     Financing") provided by FEMSA and its Subsidiaries to Parent pursuant to
     the FEMSA Commitment to be provided by the Subsidiary of FEMSA (the "FEMSA
     Transferor") that, as of the date hereof and as of the date such equity
     financing is provided, owns all of the Parent Series A Shares;

          (iii) Parent represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that as of the
     date hereof and as of the date of the Equity Financing, it does not, and
     will not, have any plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of the
     shares of the Company received upon the Merger and, until twelve months
     after the Effective Time, will not sell or otherwise dispose of such Series
     A Shares without the prior written consent of TCCC, which consent shall not
     be unreasonably withheld;

          (iv) Until December 31, 2008, and except if Parent disposes of shares
     of the Company received upon the Merger in a manner described in Treasury
     Regulation section 1.367(a)-8(g)(2)(i), Parent will not sell or otherwise
     dispose of such shares without the prior written consent of TCCC, which
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;

          (v) Each of Parent and Company represents, warrants, covenants and
     agrees that as of the date hereof and as of the date of the Equity
     Financing, it does not, and will not, have any plan or intention to sell or
     otherwise dispose of substantially all (as defined in Rev. Proc. 77-37,
     1977-2 C.B. 568) of the assets of the Company (or cause such disposition)
     and, until twelve months after the Effective Time, will not sell or
     otherwise dispose of substantially all of such assets (or cause such
     disposition) without the prior written consent of TCCC, which consent shall
     not be unreasonably withheld;

          (vi) Until December 31, 2008, and except for any disposition of
     Company assets in a manner described in Treasury Regulation section
     1.367(a)-8(g)(3), Parent will not permit the Company to sell or otherwise
     dispose of substantially all (as defined in Rev. Proc. 77-37, 1977-2 C.B.
     568) of its assets without the prior written consent of TCCC, which consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (b) Each of FEMSA and Parent represents, warrants, covenants and agrees
that as of the date hereof and as of the date of the Equity Financing, (x) the
FEMSA Transferor does not, and will not, have any plan or intention to sell or
otherwise dispose of the Parent Series A Shares that it owns at such times or
will acquire in exchange for the Equity Financing and, until twelve months after
the Effective Time, will not sell or otherwise dispose of such Series A Shares
without the prior written consent of TCCC, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (y) there are no options, warrants, convertible debt or
other rights outstanding to acquire shares of Parent stock, the exercise of
which would cause the FEMSA Transferor and the Shareholders to fail to control
(within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) Parent after the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, taking into account
such exercise; and (z) Parent does not and will not have any plan or intent to
cause the issuance


                                       15
<PAGE>


by Parent of shares of Parent stock, options, warrants, convertible debt or
other rights to acquire shares of Parent stock, which shares or the exercise of
which options, warrants, convertible debt or other rights to acquire shares of
Parent stock would cause the FEMSA Transferor and the Shareholders not to be in
control (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) of Parent after the
transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, taking
into account such issuance or exercise.

     (c) Parent and FEMSA will, and will cause the FEMSA Transferor, Merger Sub
and, after the Effective Time, the Company to, refrain from taking any action
that would be inconsistent with the intent to qualify the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this Agreement as nontaxable to the
parties hereto under the Laws of Mexico and Panama, except, with respect to
Panama, Parent and FEMSA may take the actions permitted by the second sentence
of Section 15(d) under the circumstances in which Parent or FEMSA receives an
opinion from Panamanian counsel mutually acceptable to Parent or FEMSA, as the
case may be, and TCCC, that a party to any transaction contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and this Agreement is more likely than not subject to
Panamanian tax in respect of such transaction.

     (d) Each of the parties will treat the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and this Agreement for all U.S. federal, state, local, Mexican
and Panamanian tax purposes as a nontaxable transaction with respect to TCCC and
the Shareholders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and unless,
with respect to Panama, Parent or FEMSA receives an opinion from Panamanian
counsel mutually acceptable to Parent or FEMSA, as the case may be, and TCCC,
that TCCC or a Shareholder is more likely than not subject to Panamanian tax in
respect of any transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement, (i) none of the parties will file any tax returns or other written
submissions with any relevant taxing authority that are inconsistent with the
position that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement qualifies as a nontaxable transaction under Section 351 of the Code
and as a nontaxable transaction under the Laws of Mexico and Panama, and (ii)
none of the Parent, Merger Sub or the Company will withhold any amounts or other
consideration payable to the Shareholders as a result of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement or pay over to any
Governmental Entity any such amounts in respect of taxes or otherwise.

     SECTION 16. Payments by Parent. The parties hereby agree that any amount
payable by Parent pursuant to Section 12 or 13 hereof or any amount of damages
or settlement payable by Parent resulting from any breach of Section 15 hereof
shall be equal to the product of (a) such amount without regard to this Section
16, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be one, and the
denominator of which shall be one minus the percentage representing the
aggregate percentage economic interest in the outstanding capital stock of
Parent represented by the outstanding capital stock of Parent held by TCCC and
its Subsidiaries, determined in each case at the time such payment is made by
Parent.

     SECTION 17. Miscellaneous. (a) Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties (together, in the case of the
Company and Parent, with the Merger Agreement and the Stockholder Agreements (as
defined in the Merger Agreement)) with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with


                                       16
<PAGE>



respect to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement, nor any of the
rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be transferred by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided, however, that
each Shareholder may transfer any of its respective rights and obligations to
any transferee permitted by Section 2(a).

     (b) Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, except (i) as provided pursuant to any other written
agreement or (ii) that the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by TCCC or
the Shareholders in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be reimbursed by Parent to the extent that such
reimbursement is approved by the Audit Committee of the Parent Board.

     (c) Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

     (d) Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, changed, supplemented, or
otherwise modified or terminated, except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto. In addition, no waiver or
release of compliance by any other party with any representation, agreement,
obligation or condition otherwise required to be complied with by any such party
under this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and executed by Parent
or the respective Shareholder.

     (e) Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been given
upon receipt) by hand delivery in writing or by facsimile transmission with

valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such
right, power or remedy by such party. The failure of any party hereto to
exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise
available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by
any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or
practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute
a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power
or remedy or to demand such compliance.

or otherwise seeks a vote or consent of, its stockholders for the purpose of
approving and adopting the Merger Agreement and the Merger or in connection with
the approval of a resolution asking the holders of the Company Class A Stock to

Voting Trustees shall vote, or provide a consent with respect to, all
then-outstanding shares of Company Class B Stock represented by the Owned

Agreement and the Merger and in favor of asking the holders of the Company Class

representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company

Stockholder Parties hereunder, each Stockholder Party further agrees to vote all
then-outstanding Owned Certificates Beneficially Owned by such Stockholder Party
against, and not provide consents with respect to such Owned Certificates to,
(i) any amendment to the Voting Trust Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to frustrate the Merger, the Merger Agreement, this Agreement or the
Trust Amendment, or prevent or materially impede or delay the Merger, (ii) any
proposals to remove a Voting Trustee, (iii) any proposals to increase the number
of Voting Trustees under the Voting Trust from two, and (iv) any proposal to
terminate the Voting Trust.

     (c) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that the obligations
under this Section 3 shall not be affected by any recommendation of the
Company's board of directors at the time of such meeting or consent
solicitation.

<PAGE>



other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application

remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at
law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any party hereto with its

                                   Exhibit A

                             VOTING TRUST AMENDMENT

     AMENDMENT, dated as of December 22, 2002 (this "Agreement") of the Voting

the "Voting Trust Agreement").

                                    RECITALS

     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the voting trust (the "Voting Trust"), established pursuant to the Voting Trust
Agreement, the voting trustees of the Voting Trust and certain holders of voting
trust certificates of the Voting Trust (the "Specified Voting Trust

Agreement") with Panamerican Beverages, Inc., a corporation organized under the
laws of the Republic of Panama (the "Company"), Coca-Cola Femsa, S.A. de C.V., a
corporation organized under the laws of the United Mexican States ("Parent") and
Midtown Sub Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of
Panama and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub");

     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Stockholder Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, are entering into
an Agreement of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other
things, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement;

     WHEREAS, the Specified Voting Trust Beneficiaries collectively own Trust
Certificates (as defined in the Stockholder Agreement) representing 70% or more
of the voting power of the shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company, U.S.
$0.01 par value (the "Company Class B Stock"), subject to the Voting Trust; and

     WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to enter into the Merger Agreement,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have required that the Specified Voting Trust
Beneficiaries approve the amendments to the Voting Trust Agreement set forth in
this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, to induce the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to enter into,
and in consideration for their entering into, the Merger Agreement, the
Specified Voting Trust Beneficiaries agree as follows:

          1.   The Voting Trust Agreement is hereby amended, with immediate
               effect, to provide that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
               in the Voting Trust Agreement, (i) the execution and delivery of
               this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement by the Voting Trust,
               the Voting Trustees (as defined in the Stockholder Agreement) and
               the Specified Voting Trust Beneficiaries do not and the
               performance of this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement by
               the Voting Trust, the Voting Trustees and the Specified Voting
               Trust Beneficiaries will not conflict with, result in any
               violation of, require any consent under or constitute a default
               (whether with notice or lapse of time or both) under the Voting
               Trust Agreement or

               give rise to any right of first refusal or trigger any transfer
               restriction under the Voting Trust Agreement, (ii) the
               consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms and
               conditions of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a transfer
               of any Trust Certificate or give rise to any right of first
               refusal pursuant to Section 3.3 or any other provision of the
               Voting Trust Agreement, (iii) until the termination of the
               Stockholder Agreement, the Voting Trustees shall (at each meeting
               of stockholders of the Company and in connection with each
               consent solicitation) to the extent, in each case, that the
               matters in question are not Pass-Through Matters (as defined in
               the Stockholder Agreement), vote all then-outstanding shares of
               Company Class B Stock owned by the Voting Trust against, and not
               provide consents with respect to such shares to any Contrary
               Matter (as defined in the Stockholder Agreement), and (iv) prior
               to the termination of the Stockholder Agreement in accordance
               with its terms, the amendments to the Voting Trust Agreement set
               forth in this Agreement may not be modified, amended, suspended
               or terminated, without the written consent of the Company, Parent
               and Merger Sub.

          2.   For purposes of Article 4D, Section (iii)(j) of the Company
               Articles (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the execution and
               delivery of the Stockholder Agreement by the Voting Trust, the
               Voting Trustees and the Stockholder Parties, and the performance
               of the Stockholder Agreement and the transactions contemplated
               thereby are in accordance with the Voting Trust.

          3.   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
               with the laws of the Republic of Panama, without regard to the
               principles of conflict of law. In case any provision of this
               Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable in whole
               or in part, neither the invalidity nor the unenforceability of
               this Agreement shall in any way be affected.

          4.   This Agreement is for the benefit of the Company, Parent and
               Merger Sub and shall be enforceable severally by them.

          5.   This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which may
               be deemed to be an original instrument but all together shall
               constitute but one instrument and only one set of rights and
               obligations shall arise therefrom.

caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first above
