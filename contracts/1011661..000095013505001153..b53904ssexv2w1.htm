Adverse Effect on Target.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | Other than as contemplated by this Agreement or in
connection with, or in compliance with, the provisions of the Securities Laws
and the Investment Laws, to the knowledge of Target: (i) there is no legal
impediment to the completion of Targets covenants set out in this Agreement;
and (ii) no filing or registration with, or authorization, consent or
approval of, any domestic or foreign public body or authority is required of
Target in connection with the covenants of Target set out in this Agreement,
except for such filings or registrations which, if not made, or for such
authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not received, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on Target, or impair the ability of Target to
comply with its covenants set out in this Agreement.  
    

6.4. _Litigation._ Except as disclosed publicly or in writing to SSandC, there
are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or affecting Target or any of
its subsidiaries at law or in equity or before or by any governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, which
action, suit or proceeding involves a possibility of any judgment against, or
liability of, Target or any of its subsidiaries, which, if successful, would
have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, or impair the ability of Target to
comply with any of its covenants set out in this Agreement.   

6.5. _Taxes, etc._ Except as disclosed in writing to SSandC, Target has duly and
on a timely basis filed all tax returns required to be filed by Target, other

of which, as at the close of business on February 16, 2005, 9,697,591 Target
Common Shares and 1,344,400 Target Class C Shares, and no more, were issued
and outstanding. All outstanding Target Common Shares and Target Class C
Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable shares in the capital of Target. Target is not aware of any
"adverse claims" (as defined in section 53 of the OBCA) against any of the
Target Shares. There are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements or
commitments of any nature whatsoever requiring the issuance, sale or transfer
by Target of any shares of Target (including, without limitation, Target
Shares) or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable
for, or otherwise evidencing a right to acquire, any Target Shares, except:
(x) the right of a holder of Target Class C Shares to convert such Target
Class C Shares into Target Common Shares on a one-for-one basis and (y) the
rights of holders of Target Options to exercise such options to purchase
Target Common Shares. Schedule 6.6 contains a complete and accurate
description of the Target Options, including the number of Target Common
Shares issuable upon the exercise of Target Options and the exercise prices

Disclosure Documents did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading and complied in all material respects with all
requirements of applicable law. The audited financial statements
and unaudited interim financial statements of Target and its consolidated
subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Target Public
Disclosure Documents were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in Canada and fairly present the  
---|---|--- 
      ##### 

  

  

 19  

       |   | consolidated financial position, results of operations
and changes in financial position of Target and its consolidated subsidiaries

the case of any unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments).  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | Target will deliver to SSandC as soon as they become
available true and complete copies of any report or statement required to be
filed by Target with any securities regulatory authorities or required to be
sent by Target to Target Shareholders subsequent to the date of this
Agreement. As of their respective dates, such reports and statements
(excluding any information therein provided by SSandC, as to which Target makes
no representation) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they are made, not misleading and will comply in all material respects with
all requirements of applicable law. The consolidated financial statements of
Target to be included in such reports and statements (excluding any
information therein provided by SSandC, as to which Target makes no
representation) will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in Canada (except (i) as otherwise indicated in such
financial statements and the notes thereto or, in the case of
audited statements, in the related report of Targets independent auditors or
(ii) in the case of unaudited interim statements, to the extent they may not
include footnotes or may be condensed or summary statements) and will present
fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and changes
in financial position of Target as of the dates thereof and for the periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).  
    

6.8. _No Material Adverse Change._ Except as disclosed publicly or in writing
to SSandC, since February 29, 2004, there has not been any Material Adverse
Change in respect of Target.     ##### 

  

  

 20  

6.9. _Conduct of Business._ Except as disclosed publicly or in writing to
SSandC, since February 29, 2004, neither Target nor any of its subsidiaries has
taken any action that would be in violation of section 7 if such provision
had been in effect since that date, other than violations which would not
have any Material Adverse Effect on Target, or would not materially impair
Targets ability to comply with its covenants set out in this
Agreement.   

6.10. _Advisory and Other Fees._ Target has not retained any financial
adviser, broker, agent or finder or paid or agreed to pay any financial
adviser, broker, agent or finder on account of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, except that BMO Nesbitt
Burns Inc. has been retained as Targets financial adviser in connection with
certain matters, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The fees payable by Target to BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. in respect of the Offer
will not exceed Cdn.$ 2.3 million. Target has heretofore delivered to SSandC
true and complete copies of its agreement with BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc.   

6.11. _Change of Control Provisions._ Except as disclosed in Schedule 6.11,
there are no provisions in any material agreement of Target or its
subsidiaries agreements that would terminate such material agreement or that
would permit any person to terminate such material agreement or to take any
other action if SSandC were to acquire any Target Shares under the Offer or if
SSandC were to proceed with a Compulsory Acquisition Transaction or a
Subsequent Acquisition Transaction.   

6.12. _United States Relationships._ Target and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, currently hold less than US$50 million of assets (on a book-value
basis) located in the United States and had less than US$50 million in sales
in and into the United States for Targets last fiscal year and will have
less than US$ 50 million in sales in and to the United States for Targets
fiscal year ending February 28, 2005. Targets most recent annual report or
annual information form filed or submitted by Target with applicable
securities regulators in Canada do not indicate that U.S. holders hold 25% or
more of the Target Shares, and Target does not have actual knowledge that
the level of ownership by U.S. holders of the Target Shares equals or exceeds
25% of the total of such outstanding class of securities. The term "U.S.
holder" means any person whose address appears on the records of Target,
any      ##### 

  

   

 21  

voting or other trustee, any depository, any share transfer agent or any
person acting in a similar capacity on behalf of Target, as being located in
the United States.

or make any investment (excluding normal cash management activities and
capital investments in accordance with the Targets business plans in
existence on the date hereof) either by purchase of shares or
securities, contributions of capital (other than to wholly owned
subsidiaries), property transfer, or purchase of, other than in the ordinary
course of business, any property or assets of any other individual or entity;
(iii) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or any other material

endorse or otherwise as an accommodation become responsible for,
the obligations of any other individual or entity, or make any loans or

be materially  
---|---|--- 
     ##### 

  

   

       

23    

       |   | adverse to the business, operations, or financial
condition of Target and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to the ability

required under the terms of any other written contract, certain bonuses to be
authorized by the Targets board in the aggregate amount of Cdn.$115,000, and

9.3. _Notice to SS andC Concerning Alternative Transaction._ Target will
immediately notify SSandC, at first orally and then promptly in writing, of any
Alternative Transaction that becomes known to Target, or any amendment to any

28   

9.5. _Proceeding With a Superior Proposal._ Subject to SSandCs rights and
Targets obligations under section 9.6, Target may accept, approve or
recommend or enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement to proceed
with a Superior Proposal in respect of which there has been no breach of this
Article 9, but only if:    

       | (a)   | Target has complied with its obligations under
section 9.2 and the other provisions of this Article 9 and has provided SSandC
with a copy of the Superior Proposal; and  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | a period (the "Response Period") of five business days
shall have elapsed from the date on which SSandC received written notice from
the board of directors of Target that the board of directors of Target
determined, subject only to compliance with this section 9.5 and section 9.6,
to accept, approve, recommend or enter into a binding agreement to proceed
with the Superior Proposal.  
    

9.6. _Response by SS andC._ During the Response Period, SSandC will have the
right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of the Offer. The
board of directors of Target will review any such proposal by SSandC to amend
the terms of the Offer, including, without limitation, an increase in, or
modification of, the consideration to be received by the Target Shareholders,
to determine, in accordance with section 9.2, whether the Acquisition
Proposal to which SSandC is responding would be a Superior Proposal when
assessed against the Offer as it is proposed by SSandC to be amended. If the
board of directors of Target does not so determine, the board of directors
of Target will promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer as described
in section 2.6. If the board of directors of Target does so determine, Target
may approve, recommend, accept or enter into an agreement, understanding or
arrangement to proceed with the Superior Proposal.   

9.7. _Amendment to any Acquisition Proposal._ Each successive amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal that results in an increase in, or modification of, the
consideration (or value of such consideration) to be received by the Target
Shareholders shall constitute a      ##### 

  

     

29   

new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of sections 9.5 and 9.6 and SSandC
shall be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each such Acquisition
Proposal.

Agreement until it has been terminated in accordance with this Article
10.   

10.2. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated, by written notice

time SSandC first takes up and pays for Target Shares under the Offer:

if SSandC shall not have taken up and paid for Target Shares under the Offer on
or before the Outside Date, unless the reason for SSandC not so taking up and
paying for the Target Shares shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform any of the obligations under this
Agreement required to be performed by such party; or  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | by SSandC, if the Offer terminates or expires at the Expiry

waived; or  
      
     | (c)   | by either SSandC or Target, if the board of directors of
Target, pursuant to section 9.2 or 9.5 shall withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation concerning the Offer; or  
      
     | (d)   | by either SSandC or Target, if the board of directors of
Target approves, recommends or accepts, or enters into any agreement (other
than a confidentiality agreement) in respect of, a Superior Proposal; or  
      
     | (e)   | by either SSandC or Target, if the other such party shall
not have complied in all material respects with such other partys covenants
and obligations under this Agreement to be complied with at or prior to the
Expiry Time, or if any of the  
      #####

       |   | representations and warranties of such other party
under this Agreement is not true and correct in all material respects.

10.2(c), where the reason for the termination is a change in the
recommendation of the Targets board because of a Superior Proposal that SSandC
has declined to match under section 9.6 ; or  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | termination of this Agreement pursuant to subsection
10.2(d); or  
      
     | (c)   | the acquisition prior to the Expiry Time of Target Shares

by any group of persons acting jointly or in concert (other than Katotakis or
any person controlled by Katotakis) if, as a result of such acquisition, such
person or group would beneficially own or exercise control or direction over
50% or more of the Target Shares then outstanding; or

such termination by SSandC occurs prior to the purchase by SSandC of Target Shares
pursuant to the Offer, the Offer shall be terminated without any Target
Shares being so purchased. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
in this section 10.4 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of
any provision of this Agreement.

SCHEDULE 1.1    

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER    

General Terms    

The Offer shall be made by a take-over bid circular to all Target Shareholders
and prepared in compliance with the Securities Act (Ontario) and other
applicable provincial securities laws. The Offer shall be open for at least
35 days from the date the Offer is mailed to the Target Shareholders, subject
to the right of SSandC to extend the period during which Target Shares may
be deposited under the Offer or such longer period as may be required to
satisfy all of the conditions set forth below (the "Expiry Time").    

Price of the Offer    

The Offer shall be Cdn.$17.70, in cash consideration, per Target
Share.    

Target Options    

Subject to obtaining TSX and any other necessary approvals, Target will amend
the terms of the Target Options (vested and unvested) to provide that each
Target Option may be surrendered to Target, during the surrender period
hereinafter described, in exchange for cash in an amount equal to the product
of (i) the number of Target Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Target
Option and (ii) Cdn.$17.70 minus the exercise price per Target Share under
the Target Option. The surrender period will be the period of 30 days
commencing on the date that SSandC first takes up Target Shares under the
Offer. Target will give prompt written notice to Target Optionholders of such
amendment to the terms of the Target Options and upon the commencement of the
surrender period.     #####

Conditions of the Offer

up or pay for any Target Shares deposited under the Offer) or extend the
period of time during which the Offer is open (in which event, SSandC may
postpone taking up and paying for any Target Shares deposited under the

would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Target;

Expiry Time, as it may be extended, any temporary restraining order,

---|---|--- 
     

The conditions listed above are for the exclusive benefit of SSandC, and SSandC
may assert them regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any of the
conditions. Unless precluded from doing so by applicable law, SSandC may, in
its sole discretion, waive any of these conditions in whole or in part, other
than the Minimum Tender Condition. The determination as to whether any
condition has been satisfied shall be in SSandCs reasonable judgment and will
be final and binding on all parties. The failure by SSandC at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
right and each right shall be deemed a continuing right that may be asserted
at any time and from time to time until immediately following the Expiry Time
and, as to conditions involving receipt of necessary government approvals,
thereafter.    

SSandC reserves the right to terminate the Offer on or prior to the Expiry Time
if any condition to the Offer remains unsatisfied or has not been
waived.    

If the Minimum Tender Condition is satisfied and SSandC takes up Target Shares
under the Offer, SSandC shall forthwith so state in a press release and shall,
unless at least 90% of the Target Shares have been tendered to the Offer,
extend the Expiry Time by a minimum of 10 days.
