Transmittal by any Stockholder, duly completed and validly signed in
accordance with its instructions, and surrender of Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented such shares of Common Stock (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) (other than with respect to Excluded Shares), such
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the payments, if any, set forth in _Section 8.2_ , in each
case in accordance with the provisions hereof, in respect of such shares, and
the Book-Entry Shares or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any
cash to be delivered upon compliance with the procedures described above, may
be issued to the transferee if the Paying Agent receives documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable transfer taxes have been paid or that transfer taxes are not
applicable. All cash paid as Per Share Merger Consideration upon
the surrender of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the applicable shares of Common Stock. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable as provided above.

(iii) _Transaction Expenses_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to pay the Transaction Expenses to the
applicable payees thereof.

(c) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Stockholders for one (1) year after the Effective
Time shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered by the
Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation. Any Stockholder (other than with
respect to Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) for, and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for such
StockholderÂ’s shares of Common Stock upon surrender of its Book-Entry Shares
or Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof). Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of shares of
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person
of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the number of shares of
Common Stock formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

 



14 Section 3.3 _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The merger
consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
all shares of Common Stock (and all Options and all RSUs), and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Common Stock
(or Options or RSUs) that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. From
and after the Effective Time, the Stockholders shall cease to have any rights
with respect to shares of Common Stock, all Optionholders shall cease to have
any rights with respect to Options and all RSU Holders shall cease to have any
rights with respect to RSUs, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
merger consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Article III_.

 

Section 3.4 _Equity Awards_.

Incentive Plan, each then outstanding Option that has an exercise price that
is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration, whether or not exercisable or

Share Merger Option Consideration and (ii) the payments, if any, set forth
in  _Section 8.2_, in each case in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Subject to delivery by each Option holder to the Surviving Corporation of an
equity award surrender agreement that has been duly completed and validly
signed (in form and substance to be provided by the Company prior to the
Effective Time and to be reasonably acceptable to Parent) (the " _Equity Award
Surrender Agreement_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of
any such Option, immediately after the Effective Time, for each such Option
canceled an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share Merger
Option Consideration (the aggregate amount payable in respect of Options
pursuant to this _Section 3.4_, the " _Option Cancellation Amount_ "), in
each case, less required withholding Taxes. To the extent that any outstanding
Option has an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Per Share
Merger Consideration, such Option shall be cancelled upon the Effective Time,
without any consideration being paid to the applicable Optionholder
whatsoever. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this  _Section 3.4(a)_.

 



15 (b) At the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Incentive Plan, each then outstanding time-based vesting restricted stock
unit award (including for the purpose of this _Section 3.4(b)_ , any RSUs that
are vested but have not yet been settled at the Effective Time) granted
pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan (each, an " _RSU_ ") shall vest, be
canceled and converted into the right receive (i) the Per Share Merger RSU
Consideration (as defined below) and (ii) the payments, if any, set forth in
_Section 8.2_, in each case in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Subject to each RSU holderÂ’s delivery to the Surviving Corporation of an
Equity Award Surrender Agreement that has been duly completed and validly
signed, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, each holder of any such RSU,
immediately after the Effective Time, for each such RSU an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Per Share Merger RSU Consideration (the
aggregate amount payable in respect of RSUs pursuant to this _Section 3.4_,
the " _RSU Payment Amount_ "), in each case, less required withholding Taxes.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.4(b)_.

 

(c) On the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Company, for
the benefit of the Optionholders and the RSU Holders, a cash amount equal to
(i) the Option Cancellation Amount, plus (ii) the RSU Payment Amount.

 

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
Stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall
be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to
such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost its right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such holderÂ’s shares of Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration
for each such share, in accordance with  _Section 3.1_, without interest.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice and a copy of any written demands
for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the
Company relating to StockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal, and, at ParentÂ’s
expense, Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal by
Stockholders under the DGCL, so long as Parent does not create any pre-

or their SubsidiariesÂ’ assets, properties, businesses, product lines, or
services, or any interest or interests therein; or (y) take or commit to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit or agree to limit its freedom
of action or that of the Company (or any Subsidiary, division or Affiliate of
either Parent or the Company) or the Named Entities in any respect in order to
(i) resolve, avoid or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be
asserted by a Governmental Body in the PRC (and not by any Governmental Body
outside the PRC) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii)
avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned, any decree, order or judgment made by a Governmental

on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry
of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned or terminated, any
decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would restrain, prevent, or delay the Closing prior to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including by pursuing all available
avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative
action.

with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. The parties shall comply at the
earliest practicable time, and in any event no later than required by CFIUS or
any CFIUS member agency, with any request for additional information,
documents or other materials, and will cooperate with each other in

investigation or other inquiry of CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency. The
parties shall each use their best efforts to promptly inform the other party

practicable, including, but not limited to, executing a letter of assurance
or entering into another form of mitigation agreement with CFIUS or CFIUS
member agencies on terms, conditions, or measures sought by CFIUS, _provided
however_ , that neither party shall be required to take or agree to take any
undertaking that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent or its Affiliates be
obligated to execute any settlements, undertakings, consent decrees,
stipulations, or other agreements with CFIUS or CFIUS member agencies that
would (i) limit ParentÂ’s or its AffiliatesÂ’ ability to acquire, or require the
sale,

 



46  divestiture, or other disposition of, one or more of the assets, properties,
product lines, or services or any interests therein of the Surviving
Corporation, (ii) remove (A) oversight, management and control by Parent or
its Affiliates, or (B) physical or other access by them to, assets, books and

more of the CompanyÂ’s U.S. net sales in the financial year 2015 or that are
located outside the United States, or (iii) require Parent or its Affiliates
to hold their ownership interests in the Surviving Corporation through proxy

in this Agreement (including _Sections 6.5(b)_ and _6.5(c)_ ) to the contrary,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (A) be required to make

6.5_ and in connection with the Debt Financing Documents to the extent
any such action could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability
of any kind to any such director, officer or employee.

Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation by the Company, its

the Closing Date.

 



49 Section 6.6 _Confidentiality_. Parent acknowledges that the information
provided to it in connection with this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is
subject to the terms of Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

Section 6.7  _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who
at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including fees
and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the Company),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the
fact that an Indemnitee was a director, officer or employee of the Company or
such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the IndemniteeÂ’s
capacity as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of the
Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company
or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or
other enterprise (including any employee benefit plans)), in each case under
(A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time as provided in the CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time,
shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and
the Surviving Corporation to, pay any expenses (including fees and expenses
of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 6.7_ (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this _Section 6.7_ ) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection
with investigating or defending any such to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law;
_provided_ , however, that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for
any settlement effected without the Surviving CorporationÂ’s prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



50 (b) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and
control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any
acts or omissions covered under this _Section 6.7_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") with
counsel selected by the Indemnitee, which shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent;  _provided_ , however, that Parent shall be permitted to participate
in the defense of such Claim at its own expense. Each of Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense
of any Claim and shall provide access to properties (including the Real
Property) and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be
furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.

(c) For the six (6)-year period commencing at the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any
additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (provided
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may (i) substitute therefor policies,
issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) obtain as of the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time). In no event will Parent or
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for each covered year an
amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium for such insurance (the
" _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage is terminated, cancelled,
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will maintain such
insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of the six-year period for
a premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. True and complete copies of
current and effective directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies
have been provided to Parent.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification
is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_).

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation or the transferee of such properties and assets
shall expressly assume and be responsible for all of the obligations thereof
set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 



51 Section 6.8 _Publicity_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld, unless, in the judgment of the Company or
Parent, as applicable, public disclosure is otherwise required by applicable
Law (including applicable securities Laws) or by the applicable rules of any
stock exchange on which Parent lists securities, provided that, to the extent
required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult
with the other party with respect to the text thereof. The Company and Parent
agree that the initial press release to be issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be in a form mutually agreed.

 

Section 6.9 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to
provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Employees_ ") (i) for the period of twelve (12) months immediately following
the Closing Date, (x) at least the same level of base salary and hourly wages
as in effect on the Closing Date, and (y) employee benefit and incentive
plans, programs, contracts and arrangements that are substantially similar, in
the aggregate, to similar employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and
arrangements provided by the Company and its Affiliates to Company Employees
prior to the Closing Date; and (z) coverage under the severance plans or
policies no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those severance plans or
policies provided by the Company and its Affiliates to Company Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date or severance benefits applicable to
similarly situated employees of Parent; and (ii) for the period immediately
following the Closing Date until December 31, 2017, substantially similar, in
the aggregate, cash incentive bonus opportunity as in effect on the Closing
Date. From and after the Closing Date, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall
honor, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with
their terms, all employment, retention and severance agreements and all
severance, incentive and bonus plans, programs and arrangements as in effect
on the Closing Date that are applicable to any current or former employees or
directors of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions, including the
amendment and termination provisions, thereof. Parent or one of its
Affiliates shall recognize the service of the Company Employees with the
Company and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent
and its Affiliates in connection with any pension or welfare benefit plans
and policies (including vacations, paid time-off, and holiday policies)
maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ")
which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its
Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility, benefit
entitlement and benefit accrual, provided that service credit shall not be
required with respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan, or to the extent that service credit would result in a
duplication of benefits. Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, to
the extent commercially and administratively practicable, (i) waive, or cause
its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and at-
work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Company Employees under any welfare benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made available to Company

 



52  Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its Affiliates, and
(ii) provide credit to Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under the employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries during
the portion of the relevant plan year including the Closing Date.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_ to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Parent Plan or Company Benefit Plan, or
shall limit the right of Parent or one of its Affiliates or the Surviving
Corporation to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Parent Plan or
Company Benefit Plan following the Effective Time. If (i) a party other than
the parties hereto makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any
provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any Parent Plan or Company
Benefit Plan, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such
plan even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then,
solely with respect to such plan, such provision shall lapse retroactively and
shall have no amendatory effect with respect thereto.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.9_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person,
including, without limitation, any current or former employees or directors
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, any participant in any Company Benefit
Plan or any Parent Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to
continued employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 6.10 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partyÂ’s
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand that (i)
nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other partyÂ’s operations
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete and independent control and supervision
over its operations.

acquisition", "fair price", "supermajority", "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and their respective
boards, shall cooperate and grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.12 _Exchangeable Notes_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company

continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause all of
its and their representatives to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes hereof, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean

its Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation,
recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination transaction
involving the Company; (ii) the issuance, acquisition or sale of shares of

of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations promulgated
thereunder) the right of any such "disqualified individual" to receive the
Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to soliciting such waivers and approval,
the Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and approval materials to
Parent for its reasonable review no later than three (3) Business Days prior

280G Benefits fail to be approved as contemplated above, such Waived 280G
Benefits shall not be made or provided. Prior to Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent that a vote of the
stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.19_ and that either (i) the requisite number of
votes of the Stockholders of the Company was obtained with respect to the
Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ ") or (ii) the 280G Approval was
not obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be
made or provided.

Section 8.1 _Survival_. The representations, warranties and covenants of the
parties hereto contained herein shall not survive the Effective Time, except

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 8.2_ , the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement shall entitle Parent and its Affiliates and their respective
representatives and

 



57  permitted assigns (each, a " _Parent Indemnitee_ ") to the disbursement of

to indemnify each Parent Indemnitee against, and reimburse each Parent
Indemnitee for, any Losses (" _Indemnifiable Losses_ ") described in _Schedule
8.2(a)_ or _Schedule 8.2(b)_ , respectively, and required to be paid by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a final
resolution with the relevant Governmental Body (a " _Resolution_ ") of the
matters set forth in _Schedule 8.2(a)_ (the " _First Indemnifiable Matter_ ")

regarding any Indemnifiable Matter (including any such directions regarding
the settlement, compromise, appeal or litigation), provided that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to follow any such directions regarding a
settlement or compromise that would (A) result in Indemnifiable Losses that
would exceed the amount in the First Indemnity Escrow Account or the Second
Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable, (B) cause the Surviving Corporation
(or an Affiliate thereof) to incur material liabilities with respect to a
period beginning after the Closing Date, or (C) not result in a complete
Resolution of either the First Indemnifiable Matter or the Second
Indemnifiable Matter, as applicable.

 



58 (d) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
applicable Indemnity Escrow Account for the reasonable costs of outside

Indemnifiable Matter.

 

(e) Within fifteen (15) Business Days following a Resolution after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the
New York Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, instructing

Account (i) to the applicable Parent Indemnitee an amount equal to the lesser
of (x) the Indemnifiable Losses resulting from such Resolution (less any prior
disbursements in respect of the applicable Indemnifiable Matter pursuant to
the proviso below) and (y) the balance of the applicable Indemnity Escrow
Account, and then (ii) (A) to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Stockholders, and (B) to the Surviving Corporation for payroll processing and
distribution at the next administratively practicable payroll date to each
Optionholder and RSU Holder, in each case, on a pro-rata basis (calculated
based on the shares of Common Stock, Options, and RSUs, held by each
Stockholder, Optionholder and RSU Holder, as applicable, immediately prior to
the Effective Time) any funds remaining in the applicable Indemnity Escrow
Account after the disbursement to the applicable Parent Indemnitee; _provided_
, _however_ , that if certain portions or aspects of an Indemnifiable Matter
are finally resolved prior to the Resolution of such Indemnifiable Matter,
then by mutual agreement of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Stockholders Representative, the amount of Indemnifiable Losses resulting from
such resolution shall be disbursed from the applicable Indemnity Escrow
Account to Parent within fifteen (15) Business Days following such resolution.

(f) If there is no Resolution of the Second Indemnifiable Matter prior to the
Resolution of the First Indemnifiable Matter after the Closing, then the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
provide a joint written instruction to the New York Escrow Agent within
fifteen (15) Business Days of the Resolution of the First Indemnifiable Matter
instructing the New York Escrow Agent to disburse (A) fifty percent (50%) of
the balance of the Second Indemnity Escrow Account to the applicable Parent
Indemnitee and (B) fifty percent (50%) of the balance of the Second Indemnity
Escrow Account (I) to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Stockholders, and (II) to the Surviving Corporation for payroll processing and
distribution at the next administratively practicable payroll date to each
Optionholder and RSU Holder, in each case, on a pro-rata basis (calculated
based on the shares of Common Stock, Options, and RSUs, held by each
Stockholder, Optionholder and RSU Holder, as applicable, immediately prior to
the Effective Time).

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
if there is a Resolution of the First Indemnifiable Matter and a Resolution
of the Second Indemnifiable Matter prior to the Closing, then:

 

(i) the Base Consideration shall be reduced by the lesser of (x) the
Indemnifiable Losses resulting from the Resolution of the First Indemnifiable
Matter and (y) US$50,000,000;

 



59 (ii) the Base Consideration shall be further reduced by the lesser of (x) the
Indemnifiable Losses resulting from the Resolution of the Second
Indemnifiable Matter and (y) US$10,000,000;

(iii) the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall equal zero; and

(iv) the other provisions of this _Section 8.2_ shall cease to have any
effect.

 

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
there is a Resolution of the First Indemnifiable Matter but no Resolution of
the Second Indemnifiable Matter prior to the Closing, then:

(i) the Base Consideration shall be reduced by the lesser of (x) the
Indemnifiable Losses resulting from such Resolution plus US$5,000,000 and (y)
US$55,000,000;

(ii) the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall equal zero; and

(iii) the other provisions of this _Section 8.2_ shall cease to have any
effect.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
there is a Resolution of the Second Indemnifiable Matter but no Resolution of
the First Indemnifiable Matter prior to the Closing, then:

(i) the Base Consideration shall be reduced by the lesser of (x) the
Indemnifiable Losses resulting from such Resolution and (y) US$10,000,000;

(ii) the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall equal US$50,000,000; and

(iii) the other provisions of this _Section 8.2_ shall, to the extent relating
to the Second Indemnifiable Matter or the Second Indemnity Escrow Account,
cease to have any effect.

(j) For Tax purposes, any disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Accounts to
the Stockholders (by way of the Paying Agent) shall be treated as adjustments
to the purchase price, except to the extent otherwise required by Law.

adverse determination which is not nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence); _provided_ , (i) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.2(c)_ shall not be available to the Company or
Parent, as applicable, if the issuance of such final nonappealable Order was

_Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.1(b)_ , and (B) by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the End Date or, if such breach or failure is capable of being cured

of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) if it
occurred or was continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section
7.2(b)_ , and (B) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if
such breach or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, Parent or

Date or thirty (30) days after receiving written notice from the Company
describing such breach or failure in reasonably detail;

(f) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_

(i) that no such termination shall relieve Parent of any liability of Parent
under this Agreement, including payment of the Parent Termination Fee and
other amounts if payable pursuant to _Section 9.6_ ; (ii) subject to the terms
of this Agreement, if such termination shall result from the (A) failure of
either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of
the other party or (B) failure of either party to perform an agreement or
covenant contained herein, such party shall not be relieved of any liability
to the other party as a result of such failure or breach; (iii) the
provisions of _Section 6.8_ , this _Section 9.4_ , _Section 9.5_ , _Section
9.6_, _Article X_ and _Article I_ hereof and the provisions of

(a) Concurrently, or prior to, with the date hereof, Parent and the Company
have opened an escrow account with the HK Escrow Agent (" _HK Escrow Account_
"), entered into the HK Escrow Agreement with the HK Escrow Agent, and
delivered to the HK Escrow Agent all documentation and other information that
the HK Escrow Agent reasonably determines is necessary under applicable "know
your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including the
Patriot Act), pursuant to which the HK Escrow Agent will administer the HK
Escrow Account. All costs, fees, charges and expenses assessed by the HK
Escrow Agent to maintain the HK Escrow Account as required hereunder, and any
and all penalties, obligations and liabilities associated therewith or arising
therefrom shall be paid by Parent.

 

(b) Concurrently with the execution hereof, Parent shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to the HK Escrow Agent US$100,000,000 (" _Parent Termination
Fee_ ") to be held in the HK Escrow Account, and administered by the HK Escrow
Agent, as collateral and security for the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee in accordance with this Agreement and the HK Escrow Agreement.

(c) In the event the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section
9.6_ hereof, Parent and the Company shall deliver a joint written instruction
to the HK Escrow Agent to release the funds held in the HK Escrow Account in
an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee to the Company or its designee
in accordance with the HK Escrow Agreement. If the Parent Termination Fee is
not payable pursuant to _Section 9.6_ , or if after payment to the Company of
the Parent Termination Fee additional funds remain in the HK Escrow, Parent
and the Company shall promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the HK
Escrow Agent to release such remaining funds to Parent or its designee in
accordance with the terms of the HK Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 9.6 _Termination Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event that:

(i) (A) One or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ or
_Section 7.1(d)_ (in each case solely in respect of an Order of a Governmental
Body in the PRC or due to

 



63  Laws of a Governmental Body in the PRC) has not been satisfied and (B) this
Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ , _provided_ , that the Company is not then in material breach of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement such that
Parent would not be obligated to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under _Section 7.1(a)_ and  _Section 7.1(b)_ ;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.2(c)_ (solely in respect of an Order of a Governmental Body in the
PRC or due to Laws of a Governmental Body in the PRC), provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of the representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement such that Company or
Parent would not be obligated to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under _Section 7.1(a)_ and _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.2(a)_ and
_Section 7.2(b)_ , as applicable; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.2(e)_
or _Section 9.2(f)_ ,

 

then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company or its designee an
amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee ( _provided_ , that in the
event that the Parent Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to _Section
9.6(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.6(a)(ii)_ , the Parent Termination Fee shall be equal
to US$60,000,000) either directly or out of the HK Escrow Account as promptly
as possible (but in any event within two (2) Business Days after such
termination), by wire transfer of immediately available funds; _provided_ ,
that if Parent has paid or caused to be paid to the Company or its designee
the Parent Termination Fee directly, the funds in the HK Escrow Account shall
be simultaneously released and returned to Parent or its designee. In no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 

(b) In the event that Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due
and in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, Parent shall
reimburse the Company for costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by
the Company (including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of this _Section 9.6_ , together with
interest on such unpaid Parent Termination Fee commencing on the date that
the Parent Termination Fee became due, at a rate equal to three percent (3%)
per annum. Such collection expenses shall not otherwise diminish in any way
the payment obligations hereunder.

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 9.6_ are an integral part of the
transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) the damages resulting from termination
of this Agreement under circumstances where a Parent Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and,
therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 9.6(a)_ are not a penalty
but rather constitute amounts akin to liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger,
and (iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section 9.6_ , the parties
hereto would not have entered into this Agreement.

taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of
any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further
or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

Section 10.4 _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement, including all claims
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or relating to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware

 



65  without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 10.5 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Any dispute, claim, controversy or difference arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any question regarding its existence, validity,

"), shall be determined by final and binding arbitration administered by the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution of the American Arbitration
Association (" _ICDR_ ") in accordance with its International Arbitration
Rules (the " _ICDR Rules_ ").

(b) The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the

more respondents). Such arbitrator nominations shall be made within twenty
(20) days of receipt by respondent (or respondents as the case may be) of a
request for arbitration or in default thereof appointed by the ICDR in
accordance with the ICDR Rules. The third, presiding, arbitrator shall be
appointed by agreement of the two party-appointed arbitrators within fourteen
(14) days of the appointment of the second arbitrator or in default of such

(d) The seat or place of arbitration shall be New York, New York. The
arbitration shall be held, and the award shall be rendered in the English

successor and assigns. The arbitrators will have no authority to award
consequential, special or punitive damages.

(f) Except as may be required by law, no party may disclose the existence,
content (including all submissions made to the arbitral tribunal and the
transcript of any proceedings) or any and all orders, decisions, and awards
issued by the arbitral tribunal without the prior written consent of the other
parties, unless necessary to protect or pursue a legal right, including the
right to seek annulment, recognition, and/or enforcement of any award.

Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered

Section 10.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.8 _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as contemplated by
_Section 3.1_ (with respect to the StockholdersÂ’ right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration), and _Section 3.4_ (with respect to the
OptionholdersÂ’ right to receive the Option Cancellation Amount and the RSU
HoldersÂ’ right to receive the RSU Payment Amount), nothing in this Agreement
shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any
person or entity not a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, subject to the provisions of _Section 6.9(c)_ , the
Company shall have the right to enforce the rights of the Stockholders, the
Optionholders and the RSU Holders to pursue damages in the event of ParentÂ’s
or Merger SubÂ’s willful and material breach of this Agreement. In addition,
the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation to enforce any rights
of the Stockholders, the Optionholders and the RSU Holders under this
Agreement. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made by any party, directly or indirectly (by operation of
Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be
void, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
one or more of their Affiliates at any time (provided that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder
or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due
to Parent or Merger Sub).

Section 10.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

 

Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding

 



68  directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this
Agreement, any Company Documents, or any transaction contemplated hereby or
thereby. Each party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Company Documents, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section 10.10_.

 

Section 10.11 _Representative_.

 

(a) The Stockholders Representative shall be the agent and attorney-in-fact
for each of the Stockholders and the Optionholders under this Agreement and
the other agreements contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 10.11_. In the event of the resignation, death or incapacity of the
Stockholders Representative, a successor Stockholder
Representative reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall thereafter be
appointed by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and such successor
Stockholders Representative.

 

(b) The Stockholders Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to act
for, and on behalf of, any or all of the Stockholders and the Optionholders
(with full power of substitution in the premises) in connection with such
matters as are reasonably necessary for the consummation and administration of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby including
executing and delivering all agreements, amendments, certificates, receipts,
consents, elections, instructions and other documents contemplated by, or
deemed by the Stockholders Representative to be necessary or desirable in
connection with, this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the other
agreements contemplated hereby and thereby and the transactions contemplated
herein or therein. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on such
appointment and to treat the Stockholders Representative as the duly appointed
attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder and Optionholder. Notices given to the
Stockholders Representative in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement shall constitute notice to the Stockholders and the Optionholders
for all purposes under this Agreement.

(c) The appointment of the Stockholders Representative is an agency coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the Stockholders
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section 10.11_ shall
be effective and absolutely binding on each Stockholder and Optionholder
notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such Stockholder or
Optionholder, except for actions or omissions of the Stockholders
Representative constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence. The death
or incapacity, or dissolution or other termination of existence, of any
Stockholder or Optionholder shall not terminate the authority and agency of
the Stockholders Representative. Parent, Merger Sub and any other party to
any document contemplated by this Agreement in dealing with the Stockholders
Representative may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any
act of the Stockholders Representative as the act of the Stockholder
or Optionholder.

(d) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder,
Optionholder or to any other Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub), with
respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders
Representative in its role as Stockholders

 



69  Representative under or in connection with this Agreement, unless such
action or omission results from or arises out of willful misconduct or gross
negligence on the part of the Stockholders Representative, and the
Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder or
Optionholder in the event that, in the exercise of his or its reasonable
judgment, the Stockholders Representative believes there will not be
adequate resources available to cover potential costs and expenses to contest
a claim made by Parent or Merger Sub.

(e) The Stockholders Representative may act pursuant to the advice of counsel
with respect to any matter relating to this Agreement and shall not be liable
for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such
advice. The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any
Order, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to
it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the
service thereof. The Stockholders Representative may act in reliance upon any
instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the
Person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute
any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized
to do so. The Stockholders Representative may conclusively presume that the
undersigned representative of any party hereto which is an entity other than
a natural person has full power and authority to instruct the Stockholders
Representative on behalf of that party unless written notice to the contrary
is delivered to the Stockholders Representative.

 

(f) The Stockholders Representative shall receive reimbursement from, and be
indemnified from, the Indemnity Escrow Account, for any and all expenses,
charges and liabilities, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, incurred by the
Stockholders Representative in the performance or discharge of its duties
pursuant to this _Section 10.11_.

 

Section 10.12 _Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that Parent and Merger Sub would suffer irreparable
damage in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages or legal remedies, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that,
in addition to any other remedies, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Company or
its Subsidiaries and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and
granted in connection therewith. The Company and its Subsidiaries hereto
hereby waive: (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance,
including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate; and (ii)
any requirement to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.
