reduce the amounts payable to holders of Shares pursuant to this Article IV.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Immediately after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) ( _i_ ) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as the Mutual Group and the Company may reasonably agree, and ( _ii_ )
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(g)) equal to ( _x_ ) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e))
multiplied by ( _y_ ) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for Shares owned
by the Mutual Group or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Mutual Group. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented
to the Surviving Corporation, the Mutual Group or the Paying Agent for
transfer, except for Shares owned by the Mutual Group or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Mutual Group, and pursuant to the
terms of Section 4(f), it shall be cancelled and exchanged for a cash amount
in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to ( _x_ ) the number of
Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by ( _y_ ) the Per Share
Merger Consideration.



 

\- 10 -

   

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, the Mutual
Group, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Mutual Group or the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be reasonably required by the Mutual Group or the Surviving
Corporation as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(f)  _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company
shall give the Mutual Group the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Mutual Group,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Mutual Group and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or the Mutual Group, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (
_i_ ) shall be remitted by the Mutual Group or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and ( _ii_ ) shall be
treated for all purposes of this  



 

\- 11 -

   

 Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the
Mutual Group, as the case may be.

4.3 _Treatment of Company Awards_.

(a) In accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plan, the Company shall
provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plan
that, in each case, is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time
(whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled, and the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive at the Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as
practicable thereafter from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for
such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the
number of Shares previously subject to such Option, and ( _ii_ ) the excess,
if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
Share previously subject to such Option, less any required withholding taxes.

(b) The Company shall provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Share that is subject to a restricted share award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and remains subject to vesting or
other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Company Stock Plan (including "Career
Shares" and Shares credited to restricted share awards as
dividend equivalents) (each a " _Restricted Share_ ") shall vest and become
free of all such restrictions as of the Effective Time, and at the Effective
Time the holder thereof shall, subject to this Article IV, be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration from the Company in exchange for
each such Restricted Share, less any required withholding taxes.

(c) The Company (at the direction of the Special Committee) shall, after the
date hereof, take all actions necessary to provide that any outstanding
offering periods in effect as of the opening of business on the date hereof
under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any other plan, program
or arrangement intending to qualify as a stock purchase plan under Section 423
of the Code (the " _Company ESPP_ ") shall continue through the next
scheduled purchase date pursuant to their terms and shall ensure that no new
offering periods thereunder shall commence following the date hereof.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company (at the direction of the
Special Committee) and the compensation committee of the board of directors of
the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and use its
reasonable best efforts to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.3(a), 4.3(b)
and 4.3(c). The Company (at the direction of the Special Committee) shall use
its reasonable best efforts to ensure that from and after the Effective
Time neither the Mutual Group nor the Surviving Corporation will be required
to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant
to or in settlement of Company Awards.

4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for  



 

\- 12 -

   

 Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Mutual
Group and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by the Mutual Group and

ARTICLE VII

Covenants 

7.1 _Interim Operations_. After the date hereof and prior to the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the businesses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be operated and conducted in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice, except as required by
applicable Law. Neither AMI nor AMF shall take or permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries (including the Company or its Subsidiaries) to take
any action or omit to take any action that is reasonably likely to ( _i_ )
result in any of the conditions of the Merger set forth in Article VIII not
being satisfied or ( _ii_ ) prevent the consummation of the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Mutual Group shall not be required hereby to
take or agree to any action that is reasonably likely to result in an Adverse
Condition.

7.2 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company (at the direction of the
Special Committee) agrees that neither the Special Committee nor any of its
members shall, and the Special Committee shall instruct and cause
its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or
the making of any Acquisition Proposal;



 

\- 16 -

   

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any confidential or non-public information
to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal (except solely to provide
written notice of the existence of these provisions); or

(iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time,
but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company (at
the direction of the Special Committee) may (A) provide information in
response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed standard confidentiality agreement
and promptly discloses (and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such
information to the Mutual Group to the extent not previously provided to it or
(B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if
and only to the extent that, prior to taking any action described in clause
(A) or (B) above, (x) the Special Committee determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) the Special Committee has
determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal.

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means ( _i_ ) any proposal or offer with respect to
a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and ( _ii_ ) any proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the total voting power of any
class of equity securities of the Company, or 25% or more of the consolidated
total assets (including, without limitation, equity securities of
its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
involving more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the Special
Committee (after consultation with independent financial and outside legal
advisors) has determined in good faith, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making
the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions
and conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the Companys
stockholders (other than the Mutual Group and its direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiaries) from a  



 

\- 17 -

   

 financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed (assuming that the Mutual Group is willing to vote in favor of the
Acquisition Proposal, but with the parties hereto acknowledging and agreeing
that nothing herein obligates the Mutual Group in any way to vote in favor of
the Acquisition Proposal). 

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
Special Committee shall not directly or indirectly:

(i) withhold, withdraw or modify (or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw
or modify), in a manner adverse to the Mutual Group, the Company
Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or

(ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose to approve, adopt or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to (but
not after) the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Special
Committee may withhold or withdraw the Company Recommendation if the Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation of the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_
that if the Change of Recommendation is due to the existence of a Superior
Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation_ "), the Special
Committee shall not make such Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation
unless the Special Committee has given the Mutual Group written notice of its
intention to take this action at least two Business Days prior to its taking
this action (it being understood that this intention or notice or the
disclosure of either will not constitute a Superior Proposal Change of
Recommendation entitling the Mutual Group or the Special Committee, as
applicable, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(c)). The
Special Committee agrees that ( _x_ ) during the two Business Day
period prior to its making a Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation, the
Mutual Group will be permitted to propose to the Special Committee revisions
to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
Special Committee and its Representatives will, if requested by the Mutual
Group, negotiate in good faith with the Mutual Group and its Representatives
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by the Mutual Group, and ( _y_ ) the Special Committee may
make a Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation in the case of an
Acquisition Proposal that was a Superior Proposal only if it continues to be a
Superior Proposal in light of any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement to which the Mutual Group and the Special
Committee have agreed prior to the expiration of such two Business Day period.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosures_. Nothing contained in Section 7.2(a) shall
be deemed to prohibit the Company (at the direction of the Special Committee)
or the directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition  



 

\- 18 -

   

 Proposal; _provided_ that the Special Committee may not effect a Change of
Recommendation unless permitted to do so under, and in compliance with,
this Section 7.2; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any "stop, look and
listen" or substantially similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Change
of Recommendation.

(e) _Notice_. The Special Committee shall promptly (and, in any event, within
48 hours) notify the Mutual Group if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements).

7.3 _Information Supplied_. The Company (at the direction of the Special
Committee) shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary
form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any

the direction of the Special Committee), AMI and AMF shall prepare and file
with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, a Schedule 13E-3 under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act (such
Schedule 13-E, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Schedule
13E-3_ "). Each of the Company, AMI and AMF agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3 as filed by it will
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. (i) Each of AMI and AMF agrees
that none of the information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or Schedule
13E-3 and (ii) the Company agrees that none of the information supplied by it
with respect to this Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby for inclusion or incorporation by referenced in the Proxy
Statement or Schedule 13E-3, will, in the case of each of clauses (i) and
(ii), at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company or at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. 

7.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company (at the direction of the Special
Committee) will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders Meeting_
") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to
a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 7.2(c), the Special
Committee shall recommend such adoption and use all commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit such adoption of this Agreement.

direction of the Special Committee), AMI and AMF shall promptly notify the
other such parties and the Special Committee of the receipt of all comments of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 and of any
request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information. Each of the Company (at the direction of the Special
Committee), AMI and AMF shall promptly provide to the other such parties and
the Special Committee copies of all correspondence between it and/or any of
its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and
Schedule 13E-3. The Company (at the direction of the Special Committee), AMI
and AMF shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide prompt
responses to the SEC with respect to all comments from the SEC received on
the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3, and the Company (at the direction of
the Special Committee) shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
as promptly as reasonably possible after the date the SEC staff advises that
it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing
the Proxy Statement.

(b) _Action by Mutual Group_. The Mutual Group agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause
to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under this Agreement and applicable Laws (in each case with the consultation
and consent of the Special Committee, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
obtaining the Aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with _Schedule 6.8_
of the Mutual Group Disclosure Letter, as soon as practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings, including filings
with Insurance Authorities, and to obtain as promptly as reasonably
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 7.5(b) shall require, or be construed to require, AMI
or AMF in connection with receipt of any regulatory approval to proffer to, or
agree or commit to, any prohibition, limitation, restraint, restriction or
impairment with respect to any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights,
businesses, operations or businesses of any of AMI, AMF or their respective
Subsidiaries, or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any required
sale, divestiture, transfer, license, lease, disposition of or encumbrance or
hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) arrangement with respect to
any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights, operations or businesses of
AMI, AMF or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or conduct the business of AMI, AMF or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in a
specified manner or otherwise limit the freedom of action, or agree to limit

 respective Subsidiaries, or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
such a manner that, individually or in the aggregate, materially and
adversely affects the benefits to the Mutual Group and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, that the
Mutual Group reasonably expected to derive from consummation of the Merger (an
" _Adverse Condition_ "); _provided, however_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
the definition of "Adverse Condition" shall exclude reasonable restrictions,
limitations or conditions ordinarily imposed by an applicable
Governmental Entity in similar transactions. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, the Mutual Group and the Special
Committee (on behalf of the Company) shall have the right to participate in
all matters with any Governmental Entity in connection with any filing,
report or application relating to this Agreement made or to be made with any
Governmental Entity, and any responses to inquiries therefrom and any
discussions therewith, _provided_ that the Mutual Group, the Company and the
Special Committee shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the others on and consider in good faith
the views of the others in connection with, all of the information
relating to any of AMI, AMF, the Company or the Special Committee, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries (as applicable), that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy
Statement and Schedule 13E-3).

(c) _Information_. The Company (at the direction of the Special Committee and
to the extent reasonably known by the Special Committee) and each of AMI and
AMF shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement, Schedule 13E-3 or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of AMI, AMF, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company, AMI, AMF and the Special Committee each
shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of written notices or other written communications received
by AMI, AMF, the Company or the Special Committee, as the case may be, or any
of its Subsidiaries (as applicable), from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. AMI and AMF shall give prompt notice to the
Special Committee of any change, fact or condition that is reasonably expected
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, and each of AMI, AMF and the
Special Committee shall give prompt notice to the others of any failure of
any condition to any partys obligations to effect the Merger. For the
avoidance of doubt such notice shall not be deemed to cure a breach of the
representations and warranties of the Company, AMI or AMF, as applicable, or
limit in any manner the Companys, AMIs or AMFs causes of action and
remedies in Law and equity.

7.6 _Certain Transactions Prior to or at Effective Time_. _Schedule 7.6_ to
the Mutual Group Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete list of the
Subsidiaries of the Company that are licensed to conduct the business of
insurance (the " _Company Insurance Subsidiaries_ "). Prior to or at Closing,
as and when requested by the Mutual Group, the Company (in each case with the
consultation of the Special Committee) shall, and shall cause the applicable
Company Insurance Subsidiaries to, take all corporate and other actions
necessary or appropriate to effect the transactions set forth on _Schedule
6.8_ of the Mutual Group Disclosure Letter. Prior to (i) the Closing and (ii)
the taking of any action to effect the transactions set forth in paragraph 2
on _Schedule 6.8_ of the Mutual Group Disclosure Letter, the Mutual Group
shall cause the Companys chief financial officer to prepare, execute and
deliver a certificate to the Companys Board of Directors confirming that the
actions to be taken pursuant to this Section 7.6 as set forth in paragraph 2
on _Schedule 6.8_ are compliant with Section 10-2b-6.40 of the Code of
Alabama.

7.7 _Publicity_. Except with respect to any Change of Recommendation made in
accordance with this Agreement, the Special Committee and the Mutual Group
each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including Nasdaq)
with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of Nasdaq or by the request of
any Governmental Entity.

7.8  _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense. 

7.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Mutual Group shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when
acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under Delaware Law and its certificate of incorporation and
by-laws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under and in accordance with the provisions of the Companys
certificate of incorporation and by-laws in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ that any determination required to be made with  



 

\- 22 -

   

 respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the
standards set forth under the Companys by-laws shall be made by independent
counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (such independent counsel to be
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation).

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 7.9, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation thereof,
but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party and then only to such
extent. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), ( _i_ )
the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense,
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues that
raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the
use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest, _provided_ that the smallest number of
counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; ( _ii_ ) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter to the
extent reasonable; and ( _iii_ ) the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and
_provided further_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law or the
Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws in effect on the date
hereof.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause, and if the Company
is unable to, the Mutual Group shall cause, the Surviving Corporation as of
the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with
a claims period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any  



 

\- 23 -

   

 reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Mutual Group shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with benefits and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Mutual Group shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6) year period with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any DandO Insurance
required by this Section 7.9(c) an annual premium amount in excess of 250% of
the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns ( _i_ )
shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or ( _ii_ ) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
Section 7.9.

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.9 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

7.10 _Other Actions by the Company_.

(a) _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. 

(b) _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors
of the Company may adopt resolutions that specify ( _i_ ) the name of each
individual whose disposition of Shares (including Company Options and other
derivative securities with respect to Shares) is to be exempted, ( _ii_ ) the
number of Shares (including Company Options and other derivative securities
with respect to Shares) to be disposed of by each such individual, and ( _iii_
) that the approval is granted for purposes of exempting the disposition from
Section 16(b) of the  



 

\- 24 -

   

 Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3(e) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall
provide to counsel of the Mutual Group for its review a true and
complete copy of such resolutions to be adopted by the board of directors of
the Company prior to such adoption.

(c) _Tax Certificate_. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company may
provide the Mutual Group a statement pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(c)(3) certifying that the Company is not a U.S. real property
interest (as defined by the Code).

7.11 _The Mutual Group Vote_.

(a) Without limiting the effect of any vote or consent of the Mutual Group
with respect to any Merger Sub Stock prior to the date hereof, each of AMI
and AMF agrees to vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a
consent to be given with respect to) any shares of Merger Sub Stock
beneficially owned by it or with respect to which it has the power (by
agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a
consent), in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement at any
meeting of stockholders of Merger Sub at which this Agreement shall be
submitted for adoption and approval and at all adjournments or postponements
thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of stockholders of Merger Sub by
consent in lieu of a meeting).

(b) Each of AMI and AMF shall vote or cause to be voted any Shares
beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which
it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement, proxy
or otherwise) to cause to be voted, in each case as of the date hereof, in
favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement at any meeting of
stockholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall be submitted for
adoption and approval and at all adjournments or postponements thereof. With
respect to such Shares, each of AMI and AMF agrees that any action to adopt
and approve this Agreement shall be made only at a duly convened meeting of
stockholders of the Company for such purpose and that neither AMI, AMF, nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall act by written consent in lieu of a
meeting to approve and adopt this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

7.12 _Continuation of the Special Committee_. The Mutual Group and Merger Sub
agree that, from and after the date of this Agreement, subject to applicable
Law, at all times prior to the earlier of (x) the Closing or (y) the
termination of this Agreement, they shall not authorize their designees to the
Companys board of directors to terminate the existence of the
Special Committee or materially change its duties or authority or its current
membership (so long as its existing members are willing to serve and have not
been removed for cause). Prior to the earlier of (x) the Closing or (y) the
termination of this Agreement, the Mutual Group and Merger Sub shall not seek
to remove the members of the Special Committee from the Companys board of
directors (other than in the case of removal for cause, as determined in good
faith by the Companys board of directors) and, should all the members of the
Special Committee cease to so serve, the Mutual Group or Merger Sub shall not
restrict the Companys board of  



 

\- 25 -

   

 directors from causing the election of an individual or individuals to the
board of directors of the Company who constitutes an "independent" director
under the applicable Nasdaq rules and causing the appointment of such director
or directors to be a member or members of the Special Committee, as the case
may be.

10.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 7.9 (which
is intended for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties), the Mutual Group and
the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including, without
limitation, the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set
forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third-party
beneficiaries under Section 7.9 shall not arise unless and until the Effective
Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 10.3
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

10.9 _Obligations of the Mutual Group and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of AMI or AMF to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of AMI or
AMF, respectively, to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires the Company to take any
action at the direction of the Special Committee, then such action (including
any such action required by this Section 10.9) shall only be taken at
the direction of the Special Committee.

10.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, ( _a_ ) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision, and ( _b_ ) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

10.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
Law or otherwise. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is
void.
