Merger becoming effective at the Effective Time:

 

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger that does not qualify as a
Dissenting Share ( _"Participating Company Common Stock"_ ) shall, ipso facto
and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, become and be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration from
Buyer. No interest shall accrue or be payable with respect to the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 

(b) Each Company Certificate representing share(s) of Participating Company
Common Stock ( _"Participating Company Certificate"_ ), shall represent only
the right to receive from Buyer the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to each share of Participating Company Common Stock represented
thereby.

 

(c) Each share of issued and outstanding Company Common Stock owned of record
immediately prior to the Effective Time by Buyer, Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, treasury stock, shall
be canceled and retired, and no cash shall be payable with respect thereto;
_provided, however,_ that shares of Company Common Stock owned of record
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the ESOP, Buyer, Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in a fiduciary capacity shall not be cancelled
and retired as provided above.

 

(d) Each Company Stock Option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time ( _"Participating Company Stock Option"_ ) shall, ipso
facto and without any action on the part of holder thereof, become and be
converted into the right to receive the difference between the Per Share
Merger Consideration and the option exercise price applicable to such
Participating Company Stock Option (the _"Option Spread"_ ) with respect to
each share of Company Common Stock covered by such Participating Company Stock
Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of Company and the
committee or committees established under the Company Stock Option Plan, shall
take such actions or make such determinations as may be required under the
Company Stock Option Plan, subject to the approval of Buyer, to

  effect the provisions of this Agreement, including amending the Company Stock
Option Plan so that each Participating Company Stock Option, whether vested or
not, will, at the Effective Time, be converted into cash equal to an amount

respect to the Option Spread.

 

(e) Each share of the common stock of NewCo that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall, ipso facto and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become and be converted
into one (1) issued and outstanding share of the common stock of the Surviving
Corporation ( _"Surviving Corporation Common Stock"_ ), and all of such shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be owned by Buyer. The
certificates representing shares of common stock of NewCo issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be
deemed to represent an identical number of shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock.

  _

Section 2.05. Payment for Participating Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the parties hereto shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Paying Agent a list of the names and

Time there shall be no further registrations or transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall make available or cause to

), or send by overnight mail or messenger delivery to a Participating
Stockholder who requests such delivery (at such Participating Stockholder\'s
expense), a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Participating Stockholder\'s Participating Company
Certificate(s) ( _"Letter of Transmittal"_ ). Upon a Participating
Stockholder\'s surrender to the Paying Agent of his, her or its Participating
Company Certificate(s) (or such documentation as is acceptable to and required

instructions thereto, such Participating Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive from the Paying Agent, and Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to
promptly pay such Participating Stockholder, by means of a check mailed via
regular U.S. mail to such Participating Stockholder, an amount equal to the
Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Participating Company Common Stock represented by such Participating
Stockholder\'s Participating Company Certificate(s) so surrendered (the
_"Participating Stockholder Merger Consideration"_ ). Buyer shall cause the
Paying Agent to take all steps reasonable or advisable to

  permit each Participating Stockholder to surrender his, her or its
Participating Company Certificate(s) prior to the Effective Time so as to
receive prompt payment of the Participating Stockholder Merger Consideration
with respect thereto after the Effective Time.

 

(d) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Participating Company Certificate(s) surrendered, it shall be a condition
of any such payment that the Participating Company Certificate(s) so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise executed in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Participating Company Certificate(s)
surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of Buyer or the Paying Agent
that any such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(e) One hundred eighty (180) days following the Effective Time, (i) Buyer
shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to Buyer a list of the names and
addresses of all Participating Stockholders who have not then surrendered
their Participating Company Certificate(s) to receive the Participating
Stockholder Merger Consideration to which they are entitled to hereunder, and
(ii) Buyer shall be entitled at its election to cause the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
made available to the Paying Agent which have not been disbursed to
Participating Stockholders. Upon the delivery of such funds to Buyer, such
Participating Stockholders shall be entitled to look to Buyer only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of the Participating Stockholder
Merger Consideration required to be made according to the terms hereof.

 

(f) The Participating Stockholder Merger Consideration paid to each
Participating Stockholder pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall constitute and
represent full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to each share of

Participating Company Stock Options; and (b) at the Effective Time, all
Participating Company Stock Options shall be cancelled. Immediately after the
Effective Time, Buyer shall pay, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to
pay, each holder of a Participating Company Stock Option identified on the
list delivered by Company to Buyer as provided above, for each Participating
Company Stock Option held, whether vested or not, an amount in cash equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Participating
Company Stock Option multiplied by the Option Spread, less any required Tax
withholdings. The payment of the consideration pursuant to this Section 2.06
shall be in full satisfaction of all

  rights pertaining to the Company Stock Option Plan and the Participating
Company Stock Options.

  _

Section 2.07. Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Article II or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Paying Agent nor any
party hereto shall be liable to a former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Stock Options for any funds delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable escheat or abandoned property laws.

  _

Section 2.08. Dissenting Shares_. The holder of any Dissenting Shares shall
have the rights, subject to the limitations, provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL. If at any time a holder of Dissenting Shares shall lose or withdraw such
holder\'s rights to appraisal with respect to such holder\'s shares of Company
Common Stock, then each such share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.04 herein.
Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any notices of dissent filed
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by Company, withdrawals of
demands for payment and any other instruments served in connection with the
exercise by stockholders of Company of their dissenters\' rights pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to notices of dissent and demands
for payment under the DGCL. Company shall not, except with the prior written

agreement or other instrument, permit concession, grant, franchise, license,
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation

disclosed in Schedule 3.03 of the Disclosure Schedule of Buyer and NewCo which
was delivered by Buyer to Company on the date hereof (the _"Disclosure

of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal or state
governmental authority is required by or with respect to Buyer or NewCo (as
the case may be) in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer or NewCo, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the absence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect
upon Buyer or NewCo (as the case may be) except for: (a) the Regulatory
Applications and all consents, approvals and authorizations associated
therewith; (b) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware; (c) any anti-trust filings, consents, waivers

to enjoin consummation of the transactions provided for herein or to obtain
other relief in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any court, governmental department, commission, agency,
instrumentality or arbitrator outstanding against Buyer or NewCo (as the case

capacities as such, having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen in
the future, would have any such effect.

Buyer Subsidiary, no federal, state or local governmental agency, commission
or other entity has initiated any proceeding or, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
investigation into the business or operations of Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary
within the past two (2) years. There is no unresolved violation, criticism or
exception by the Federal Reserve Board, the Commissioner, the FDIC or other
agency, commission or entity with respect to any report or statement referred
to herein that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Buyer on a consolidated basis.

stock of each Company Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and
issued, and are fully paid and non-assessable. None of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of any Company Subsidiary are subject to any preemptive

(other than to Company) by reason of any options, warrants, scrip, rights to
subscribe to, calls, or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to,
or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of the

existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States, and is duly
qualified to do business and

  in good standing with the OCC and in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business transacted

Effect on Company or the Bank. The Bank has the corporate power and authority
necessary for it to own, operate or lease its assets, properties and business

permitted under applicable laws. The Company has no Knowledge of any special
assessments with respect to those deposits insured by the Savings Association
Insurance Fund. The liquidation account established by the Bank in connection
with the Conversion has been maintained since its establishment in accordance
with applicable laws and the records with respect to said account are complete

existing or former savings or demand account holders of the Bank.

timely made to the IRS prior to the end of the applicable remedial amendment
period under Section 401(b) of the Code (a copy of each such determination
letter or pending application is included in Schedule 4.17 of the Disclosure
Schedule of Company), and, to the Knowledge of Company, there exist no
circumstances likely to materially adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Company Qualified Plan. To the Knowledge of Company, all such Company
Qualified Plans established or maintained by Company or any Company Subsidiary
or to which Company or any

  Company Subsidiary contribute are in compliance with all applicable
requirements of ERISA, and are in compliance with all applicable requirements
(including qualification and non-discrimination requirements in effect as of
the Closing Date) of the Code for obtaining the tax benefits the Code
thereupon permits with respect to such Company Qualified Plans. Neither
Company nor any Company Subsidiary maintains a defined benefit pension plan

or pending claim (other than benefit claims made in the ordinary course) by or
on behalf of or against any of the Company Benefit Plans (or with respect to
the administration of any of such Plans) now or heretofore maintained by
Company or any Company Subsidiary which allege violations of applicable state
or federal law which are reasonably likely to result in a material Liability
on the part of Company or any Company Subsidiary or any such Plan.

 

(d) Company and each Company Subsidiary and all other persons having fiduciary
or other responsibilities or duties with respect to the Company Benefit Plans
are and have since the inception of each such Plan been in substantial
compliance with, and each such Plan is and has been operated in substantial
accordance with, its provisions and in substantial compliance with the
applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such Plan, including the
rules and regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( _"PBGC"_ ) and the IRS under ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable law. No Company Benefit Plan has engaged in or been a
party to a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or

Company, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any payments, or

potential Takeover Proposal with respect to Company or any Company Subsidiary
or (ii) shall (A) solicit, initiate, participate in discussions of, or
encourage or take any other action to facilitate any inquiry or proposal, or

prohibitions. Any action described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section

_"BFKPN"_ ), disclosure is required under applicable law as to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company may
provide information at the request of or enter into negotiations with a third
party with respect to an unsolicited Takeover Proposal (defined below) if the

take such action, and _provided further,_ that Company may not, in any event,
provide to such third party any information which it has not provided to
Buyer. Company shall promptly notify Buyer orally and in writing in the event

disclosed in such preliminary report that are reasonably approved in writing
by Buyer.

 

(b) Surveys certified in accordance with current ALTA land survey standards by

hereof.

   

_Section 5.06. Environmental Investigation_. (a) Buyer shall engage or caused
to be engaged an environmental consultant to conduct a preliminary ( _"Phase
I"_ ) environmental assessment of each of the parcels of real estate used in
the operation of the businesses of Company and any Company Subsidiary and any
other real estate owned by Company or any Company Subsidiary. The fees and
expenses of the consultant with respect to the Phase I assessments shall be
paid by Company. The consultant shall complete and deliver the Phase I
assessments not later than forty-five (45) days after the date of this
Agreement. If in the reasonable opinion of Buyer any material adverse
environmental conditions are found, suspected, or would tend to be indicated
by the report of the consultant, then the parties shall obtain from one or
more mutually acceptable consultants or contractors, as appropriate, an
estimate of the cost of any further environmental investigation, sampling,
analysis, remediation, or other follow-up work that may be necessary to
address those conditions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

 

(b) Upon receipt of the estimate of the costs of all follow-up work to the
Phase I assessments or any subsequent investigation phases that may be
conducted, the parties shall attempt to agree upon a course of action for
further investigation and remediation of any environmental condition
suspected, found to exist, or that would tend to be indicated by the report of
the consultant. All post-Phase I investigations or assessments (the cost of
which shall be paid by Company), all work plans for any post-Phase I
assessments or remediation, and any removal or remediation actions that may be
performed, shall be mutually satisfactory to Buyer and Company. If the work
plans or removal or remediation actions would cost more than $1,000,000
(individually or in the aggregate) to complete, Buyer and Company shall
discuss a mutually acceptable modification of this Agreement. Buyer and
Company shall cooperate in the review, approval, and implementation of all
work plans.

 

(c) If the parties are unable to agree upon a course of action for further
investigation and remediation of an environmental condition or issue raised by
an environmental assessment and/or a mutually acceptable modification to this
Agreement, and the condition or issue is not one for which it can be
determined to a reasonable degree of certainty that the risk and expense to
which Buyer, its Subsidiaries, Company or any Company Subsidiary would be
subject as owner of the property involved can be quantified, in good faith,
and limited to an amount less than $1,000,000, then Buyer may abandon this
Agreement by the earlier to occur of (i) sixty (60) days after the receipt of
the Phase I assessments, or (ii) the receipt of all consents and approvals

  of government regulatory authorities as legally required to consummate the
Merger and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods.

commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the Closing Date, Buyer
agrees (except as contemplated by this Agreement or to the extent that Company
shall otherwise consent in writing) that:

reasonable efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with Company in obtaining) any

contemplated hereby. Buyer will not, nor will it permit any of the its
Subsidiaries to, knowingly or willfully take any action that would adversely
affect its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  same, _provided_ that such efforts, if not successful, shall not be deemed to
satisfy any condition precedent to the Merger.

 

_Section 6.07. Press Releases_. At all times prior to the Closing Date, each
party shall mutually agree with the other prior to the issuance of any press
release or other information to the press or any third party for general
circulation with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

agreed upon press release promptly following the execution of this Agreement
which shall be prepared and filed in accordance with Rule 165 under the
Securities Act, Rule 14a-12 of the Securities Exchange Act and Regulation FD
of the Securities Exchange Act; _provided, further_ Buyer and Company shall
agree to a mutually agreeable form of notice to the employees of Company, the
Bank and Company Investments promptly following the execution of this
Agreement.

 

_Section 6.08. Delivery of Supplements to Disclosure Schedules_. Five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each party will supplement or amend
its Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if
existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedule or
which is necessary to correct any information in the Disclosure Schedule or in
any representation and warranty made by the disclosing party which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby. For purposes of determining the accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in Article III and Article IV hereof
in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section
7.01(a) and Section 7.02(a) hereof, the Disclosure Schedules of Company and
Buyer shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein as of
the date of this Agreement unless changes thereto are agreed upon by the
parties hereto in writing.

 

_Section 6.09. Resolution of Company Benefit Plans_. Company and Buyer shall
cooperate in effecting the following treatment of the Company Benefit Plans,
except as mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Company prior to the Effective
Time:

   

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any Company Benefit Plan sponsored by
Company or any Company Subsidiary may or may not, in Buyer\'s sole discretion,
be continued after the Effective Time without a termination or discontinuance
thereof as a result of the Merger, subject to the power reserved to the
Surviving Corporation or any applicable Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation under each such plan to subsequently amend or terminate the plan,
which amendments or terminations shall comply with applicable law. All
participants under the ESOP and the Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
shall at the Effective Time, be fully vested in all benefits thereunder upon
the termination of each such plan at the Effective Time.

   

(b) At or as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time as Buyer shall
reasonably determine, Buyer shall provide, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to
provide, to each employee of Company and any Company Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time ( _"Company Employees"_ ) the opportunity to participate in
each employee benefit plan and program maintained by Buyer or its Subsidiaries
for similarly-situated employees (the _"Buyer Benefit Plans"_ ) _provided_
that with respect to such Buyer Benefit Plans, 55 Company Employees shall be given credit for service with Company or any
Company Subsidiary in determining eligibility for and vesting in benefits
thereunder, but not for purposes of benefit accrual; _provided further_ that
Company Employees shall not be subject to any waiting periods or pre-existing
condition exclusions under the Buyer Benefit Plans to the extent that such
periods are longer or restrictions impose a greater limitation than the
periods or limitations imposed under the Company Benefit Plans; and _provided
further_ that to the extent that the initial period of coverage for Company
Employees under any Buyer Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA is not a full 12-month period of
coverage, Company Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Buyer
Benefit Plans for any deductibles and co-insurance payments made by such
Company Employees under the Company Benefit Plans during the balance of such
12-month period of coverage. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall obligate
Buyer to provide or cause to be provided any benefits duplicative to those
provided under any Company Benefit Plan continued pursuant to Section 6.09(a)
hereof, including extending participation in any Buyer Benefit Plan which is
an "employee pension benefit plan" under ERISA with respect to any portion of
the year during which benefits are accrued to Company Employees under the ESOP
or the Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, the power of Buyer, a Company Subsidiary or any Subsidiary
of Buyer to amend or terminate any benefit plan or program, including any
Company Benefit Plan shall not be altered or affected. Moreover, this
Agreement shall not confer upon any Company Employee any rights or remedies
hereunder and shall not constitute a contract of employment or create any
rights, to be retained or otherwise, in employment at Buyer, a Company
Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of Buyer.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, the ESOP shall be terminated in accordance with
its terms. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall be permitted to make
such changes to the ESOP as it deems appropriate to carry out the provisions
of the ESOP and this Section 6.09(c) and shall file a request for
determination with the IRS with respect to the termination of the ESOP.
Company shall submit to Buyer for its review and comment such ESOP changes
before they are made and the request for determination before it is filed with
the IRS. Buyer acknowledges that approval of the Merger by the stockholders of
Company shall constitute a "change in control" under the ESOP and that,
pursuant to the terms thereof, the ESOP Trustee may sell a sufficient number
of unallocated shares of Company Common Stock to repay the then outstanding
ESOP Loan in full, and that the ESOP Trustee may sell such shares to Company.
As soon as practicable after receipt of a favorable determination letter from
the IRS with respect to the termination, the assets of the ESOP shall be
distributed to the participants and beneficiaries or transferred pursuant to
an eligible rollover distribution as a participant or beneficiary may direct
(including a rollover into a qualified plan of Buyer, if approved by Buyer, in
which the individual is then participating). Prior to the Effective Time,
Company and each Company Subsidiary shall be entitled to make contributions to
the ESOP for purposes of making prepayments on the ESOP Loan, _provided_ such
prepayments are fully deductible by Company or the Company Subsidiary under
Section 404 of the Code (without regard to the carryover provisions of Section
404) and

    otherwise in compliance with Section 415 of the Code and do not adversely
affect the tax qualified status of the ESOP under Section 401(a) and 4975 of
the Code.

 

(d) Each Company Employee terminated involuntarily by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time who is an "Eligible Employee" (as
defined in Buyer\'s severance pay plan effective as of December 1, 1999, as
amended from time to time) and not subject to an eligibility exclusion
thereunder shall be eligible to receive severance payments from Buyer
(including outplacement services) pursuant to any severance pay plan offered
by Buyer to its employees at that time, _provided, however_ , any former
officer of Company or any Company Subsidiary who is terminated involuntarily
by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason except for cause within
thirty (30) days of the Effective Time shall receive severance payments from
Buyer ( _provided_ no such payment shall exceed one year\'s salary) equal to
two (2) month\'s salary plus one (1) week\'s salary for every year of service.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each Company Employee shall be
eligible for severance payments pursuant to this Section 6.09(d) (including
outplacement services) only if such Company Employee is not a party to a
written employment agreement or a change of control and non compete agreement
with Company or any Company Subsidiary or who is not eligible for severance
payments under any other contract or agreement. The Director Retirement Plan
between Company and its directors shall be terminated at the Effective Time
and the maximum benefits payable thereunder shall be paid in a cash lump sum
to the directors. The good faith estimate of Company of the amount of the
maximum benefits payable under the Director Retirement Plan with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereunder and the recipients thereof are set
forth on Schedule 6.09(e) of the Disclosure Schedule of Company, subject to
the exceptions included on Schedule 6.09(e). At the Effective Time, Buyer
shall make lump-sum payments equal to the present value of the cost of post
retirement health care benefits for retired health plan participants who have
agreed to receive such payments, and the present value of the cost of post-
retirement health care benefits for eligible directors under the Director
Retirement Plan who have agreed to receive such payments, which amount shall
be based on the life expectancy of the participant and future cost of living
adjustments as calculated in amounts determined by an actuary mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Company. Company agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Buyer in persuading such participants to accept such lump-
sum payments. Buyer agrees to continue to provide after the Closing these
post-retirement health care benefits to any participant who chooses not to
accept such payments. Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
assist Buyer in persuading the directors that have Director\'s Compensation
Agreements to accept a cash lump-sum payment for the periodic payments due
thereunder. Buyer agrees to continue to pay after the Closing these periodic
payments to any director who chooses not to accept such lump sum payment. The
good faith estimate of Company of the amount of the maximum amount payable by
Buyer to directors under the Director\'s Compensation Agreements, including
amounts payable to individual directors, are set forth on Schedule 6.09(e) of
the Disclosure Schedule of Company, subject to the exceptions included on
Schedule 6.09(e). Company shall be permitted to make payments (to the extent
accrued) under its bonus plan in existence on the date hereof.

    (e) Buyer agrees to assume and honor (i) the Bank Incentive Plan and Trusts,
(ii) the employment and change of control agreements, (iii) the employee
retention agreements, (iv) the consulting agreements, and (v) all other
written agreements with current and former employees and directors as set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule of Company according to their terms with such
modifications as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule of Company. Buyer hereby
acknowledges that the Merger and the Closing constitute a change of control
for purposes of the above-mentioned agreements. Company shall take such
actions regarding certain payments to the executive officers of Company as are
set forth in Schedule 6.09(e) of the Disclosure Schedule of Company. The good
faith estimate of Company of the amount of each change of control payment
payable in cash with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and
the recipient thereof is set forth on Schedule 6.09(e) of the Disclosure
Schedule of Company, subject to the exceptions included on Schedule 6.09.(e).

 

(f) As of the Effective Time, the Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
shall be terminated in accordance with its terms. Prior to the Effective Time,
Company shall be permitted to make such changes to the Company Profit Sharing
and Savings Plan as it deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of the
Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan and this Section 6.09(f) and shall
file a request for determination with the IRS with respect to the termination
of the Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Company shall submit to Buyer
for its review and comment such Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
changes before they are made and the request for determination before it is
filed with the IRS. As soon as practicable after receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS with respect to the termination, the assets
of the Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan shall be distributed to the
participants or beneficiaries or transferred pursuant to an eligible rollover
distribution as a participant or beneficiary may direct (including a rollover
into a qualified plan of Buyer, if approved by Buyer, in which the individual
is then participating).

   

(g) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay each employee of Company and any
Company Subsidiary who is employed by Company or any Company Subsidiary on the
Closing Date and who is not a Data Process Employee a one-time lump-sum cash
bonus payment in an amount equal to 10% of such employee\'s respective base
salary as of the Closing Date, subject to all applicable withholding. Buyer
shall pay each Data Process Employee a one-time lump-sum cash bonus payment in
an amount equal to 10% of such Data Process Employee\'s respective base salary
as of the Closing Date, subject to all applicable withholding, on the earlier
to occur of (i) the date of completion of Company\'s data processing system
conversion, as determined in Buyer\'s sole discretion; (ii) the date on which
such Data Process Employee is involuntarily terminated by Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be; or (iii) June 30, 2004, provided that such
Data Process Employee is employed by Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries on such
date. In the event that any Data Process Employee or non-Data Process Employee
who is entitled to receive a bonus as provided above is paid on an hourly
basis, the amount payable to such individual shall be in an amount equal to
(i) 10% of such individual\'s gross income set forth in his or her respective
W-2 for 2003 in the event such amount is then available, or 58 (ii) if such amount is not available, 10% of such individual\'s projected
gross income for 2003, as determined in Buyer\'s reasonable discretion.

   

_Section 6.10. Conforming Entries_. (a) Company recognizes that Buyer and its
Subsidiaries may have adopted different loan, accrual, reserve and accounting
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves
for possible loan losses). Subject to applicable law, Company shall consult
and cooperate with Buyer with respect to conforming the loan, accrual and
reserve policies and practices of Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
those policies of Buyer and its Subsidiaries for financial accounting and/or
Tax reporting purposes, as specified in each case in writing from Buyer to
Company, based upon such consultation and subject to the conditions in Section
6.10(c) hereof.

 

(b) Subject to applicable law, Company shall consult and cooperate with Buyer
with respect to determining, as specified in a written notice from Buyer to
Company, based upon such consultation and subject to the conditions in Section
6.10(c), the amount and the timing for recognizing for financial accounting
and/or Tax reporting purposes Company\'s Transaction Fees and all other
expenses of the Merger and the restructuring charges relating to or to be
incurred in connection with the Merger.

 

(c) Subject to applicable law, Company and Company Subsidiaries shall (i)
establish and take such reserves and accruals and make such conforming entries
to conform the loan, accrual, reserve and accounting policies of Company and
Company Subsidiaries to the policies of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and (ii)
recognize the Transaction Expenses and all other expenses of the Merger and
restructuring charges related to or to be incurred in connection with the
Merger, in each case for financial accounting and/or income Tax reporting
purposes at such times as are reasonably requested by Buyer, but in no event
prior to three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; provided, however,
that on the date such reserves and accruals are to be taken, such entries are
made and such charges and expenses are recognized, Buyer shall certify to
Company that all conditions to Buyer\'s and NewCo\'s obligations to effect the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement as set forth in Sections 7.1 and
7.3 hereof (subject to the receipt of the Company\'s officer certificate
pursuant to Section 7.1(j) and the lapse of any waiting or similar period of
time) have been satisfied or waived; and provided, further, that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.10, Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not (i) be required to take any action pursuant to
this Section 6.10 for financial reporting purposes that is not permitted under
regulatory reporting requirements or guidance.

 

(d) No reserves, accruals, conforming entries or charges or expenses taken or
recognized at the written request of Buyer in accordance with this Section
6.10 may be a basis to assert a violation or a breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant of Company herein or the failure of any condition to any
of Buyer\'s obligations under this Agreement.

 

_Section 6.11. Stockholder Equity Statement_. Five (5) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date (the _"Determination Date"_ ), Company shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a computation of Company\'s Stockholder Equity as of the
Determination Date, and shall include a schedule setting forth in detail the
calculations made to determine such Stockholder Equity (the _"Stockholder
Equity Statement"_ ). Buyer may dispute any part of the Stockholder Equity

  Statement by notifying Company in writing of such dispute at any time prior to
the Effective Time (the _"Dispute Notice"_ ). If Company and Buyer are unable
to resolve such dispute within three (3) Business Days of the Dispute Notice
(the _"Joint Resolution Period"_ ), Company and Buyer shall jointly select
within three (3) Business Days of the expiration of the Joint Resolution
Period a nationally recognized independent accounting firm not presently
engaged by either Buyer or Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(the _"Dispute Arbitrator"_ ) to act as an arbitrator to resolve within ten
(10) Business Days after such selection all points of dispute with regard to
the Stockholder Equity Statement. Buyer and Company agree to cooperate with
the Dispute Arbitrator as reasonably required in order to resolve any such
dispute. Any resolution to the points of dispute with respect to the
Stockholder Equity Statement determined by the Dispute Arbitrator shall be
final and binding upon Buyer and Company solely for the purposes of this
Section 6.11. Each party shall be responsible for the payment of its own fees
and expenses in resolving any such disputes, and the fees and expenses of the
Dispute Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Company and Buyer.

instrument in writing signed on behalf of Buyer, Company and NewCo. Buyer,
Company and NewCo may without approval of their respective boards of
directors, make such technical changes to this Agreement, not inconsistent
with the purposes hereof, as may be required to effect or facilitate any
governmental approval or acceptance of the Merger or of this Agreement or to
effect or facilitate any filing or recording required for the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

_Section 8.06. Waiver_. Any term, provision or condition of this Agreement may
be waived in writing at any time by the party which is, or the stockholders of
which are, entitled to the benefits hereof. Each and every right granted to
any party hereunder, or under any other document delivered in connection
herewith or therewith, and each and every right allowed it by65 law or equity, shall be cumulative and may be exercised from time to time. The
failure of either party at any time or times to require performance of any
provision hereof shall in no manner affect such party\'s right at a later time
to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of a condition or of the breach of
any term, agreement, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances shall
be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any
other term, agreement, covenant, representation or warranty of this Agreement.
No investigation, review or audit by Buyer of Company, or by Company of Buyer,
prior to or after the date hereof shall stop or prevent Buyer or Company, as
the case may be, from exercising any right hereunder or be deemed to be a
waiver of any such right.

_Section 9.04. Specific Enforceability_. The parties recognize and hereby
acknowledge that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that would
result to a party by reason of the failure of either of the parties to perform
any of the obligations imposed on it by this Agreement and that in any event
damages would be an inadequate remedy in this instance. Accordingly, if any
party should institute an action or proceeding seeking specific enforcement of
the provisions hereof, the party against which such action or proceeding is
brought hereby waives the claim or defense that the party instituting such
action or proceeding has an adequate remedy at law and hereby agrees not to
assert in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a
remedy at law exists and shall waive or not assert any requirement to post
bond in connection with seeking specific performance.

 

_Section 9.05. Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) This Agreement shall be
construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

  (b) In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to
the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in Cook
County, Illinois (and elsewhere with respect to appellate courts with
jurisdiction over such matter) in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and consents to
service of process by notice as provided in Section 9.03 of this Agreement,
(ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and
(iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than a federal
or state court sitting in Cook County, Illinois.

 

_Section 9.06. Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a final and unappealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, then
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants, and restrictions contained
in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way
be affected, impaired, or invalidated unless the effect would be to cause this
Agreement to not achieve its essential purposes.

 

_Section 9.07. Entire Agreement; Binding Effect; Non-Assignment;
Counterparts_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes all other prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) is not intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder except as specifically
provided herein. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties named herein and their respective successors. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto; _provided, however,_ that Buyer may assign its rights
hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer without the prior written consent of any
other party hereto; _provided further,_ that such an assignment by Buyer shall
not relieve Buyer from any Liability if such Affiliate fails to perform this
Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts which
together shall constitute a single agreement.

 

_Section 9.08. Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy or dispute that may arise under this Agreement is likely to
involve complicated and difficult issues and therefore each such party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
Waiver, (ii) each such party understands and has considered the implications
of this Waiver, (iii) each such party makes this Waiver voluntarily, and (iv)
each such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the Mutual Waivers and Certifications of this Section 9.08.
