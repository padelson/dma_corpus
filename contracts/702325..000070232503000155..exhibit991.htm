<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<I>Section 9.04.&#9;Specific Enforceability</I>.  The parties recognize and hereby acknowledge that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that would result to a party by reason of the failure of either of the parties to perform any of the obligations imposed on it by this Agreement and that in any event damages would be an inadequate remedy in this instance.  Accordingly, if any party should institute an action or proceeding seeking specific enforcement of the provisions hereof, the party against which such action or proceeding is brought hereby waives the claim or defense that the party instituting such action or proceeding has an adequate remedy at law and hereby agrees not to assert in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists and shall waive or not assert any requirement to post bond in connection with seeking specific performance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<I>Section 9.05.&#9;Applicable Law; Jurisdiction</I>.  (a) This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">67</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><HR></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in Cook County, Illinois (and elsewhere with respect to appellate courts with jurisdiction over such matter) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and consents to service of process by notice as provided in Section 9.03 of this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than a federal or state court sitting in Cook County, Illinois.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<I>Section 9.06.&#9;Severability</I>.  If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a final and unappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants, and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated unless the effect would be to cause this Agreement to not achieve its essential purposes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<I>Section 9.07.&#9;Entire Agreement; Binding Effect; Non-Assignment; Counterparts</I>.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes all other prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) is not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder except as specifically provided herein.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their respective successors.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; <I>provided, however, </I>that Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer without the prior written consent of any other party hereto; <I>provided further,</I> that such an assignment by Buyer shall not relieve Buyer from any Liability if such Affiliate fails to perform this Agreement.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts which together shall constitute a single agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<I>Section 9.08.&#9;Waiver of Jury Trial</I>.  Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy or dispute that may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing Waiver, (ii) each such party understands and has considered the implications of this Waiver, (iii) each such party makes this Waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the Mutual Waivers and Certifications of this Section 9.08.</P>
