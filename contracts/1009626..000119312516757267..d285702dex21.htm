respective stockholders, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled
Shares, any Subsidiary-held Shares, and except for any Dissenting Shares)
shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $12.75
(such amount of cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_
"), payable to the holder thereof, without interest, in accordance with
Section 3.02.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company
Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article
3 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each holder of a non-certificated share of Company

any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest.

 

(c) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any
time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of

 



19 ##### Table of Contents

  

 shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or stock dividend thereon.

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are
(i) owned directly by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect Subsidiary of Ultimate Parent or (ii) held in treasury of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ")

immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Subsidiary-held Shares_ ")
shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation to ensure that each such
Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time and no cash or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.02 Surrender and Payment.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as Paying Agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the payment of (i) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented by a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in each case, other than the Cancelled Shares and
the Subsidiary-held Shares, and except for any Dissenting Shares and (ii) the
Option Consideration, PSU Consideration and RSU Consideration payable by the
Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.05. At or immediately after the Effective
Time, Ultimate Parent shall cause Parent to, and Parent shall, deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, RSU Consideration, PSU Consideration
and Option Consideration required to be paid by the Paying Agent
in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments in connection with the Merger
Consideration contemplated by Section 3.01 or the Option Consideration, PSU
Consideration or RSU Consideration contemplated by Section 3.05, Ultimate
Parent shall cause Parent to, and Parent shall, promptly (and in any case
within two Business Days of learning of any such insufficiency) deposit or
cause to be deposited additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that
is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to 

 



20 ##### Table of Contents

  

 irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to
be issued pursuant to Section 3.01 and the Option Consideration, PSU
Consideration and RSU Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to
Section 3.05 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of shares
of Company Common Stock (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Subsidiary-
held Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or transfer of such
Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent) in
such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, for use
in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent,
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(c) Upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required pursuant to such instructions or (ii) compliance with the reasonable
procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of Book-Entry Shares,
the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the Merger Consideration in respect of
the Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 3.

 

(d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition precedent to such payment that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of the making of such
cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered
Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer Taxes required as a
result of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



21 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 3.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards after the date which is one year following the Effective
Time shall be returned to Parent upon demand. Any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock who has not exchanged such holderÂ’s shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 and
any holder of a Cashed Out Compensatory Award who has not received the Option
Consideration, PSU Consideration and RSU Consideration in accordance with
Section 3.05 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
delivery of the Merger Consideration, RSU Consideration, PSU Consideration or
Option Consideration in respect of such holderÂ’s shares of Company
Common Stock or Cashed Out Compensatory Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Ultimate Parent, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards for any Merger Consideration, RSU Consideration, PSU
Consideration or Option Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any Merger
Consideration, RSU Consideration, PSU Consideration or Option Consideration
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock or holders of
Cashed Out Compensatory Awards immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become property of Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying
Agent pursuant to this Section 3.02 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock
for which appraisal rights shall have been properly and validly demanded in
compliance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall be returned to
Parent upon demand.

 

(h) All Merger Consideration, RSU Consideration, PSU Consideration or
Option Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of the Company Common
Stock or the Cashed Out Compensatory Awards, respectively, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock or
Cashed Out Compensatory Awards, as the case may be.

Section 3.03 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate

 to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article
3.

 

Section 3.04 Withholding Rights. Each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from any amount otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
pursuant to the Code or under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Ultimate Parent, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.05 Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each In-the-Money Company Option that is
outstanding and vested (including any unvested In-the-Money Company Options
that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, not
assumed pursuant to Section 3.05(b) and vest in connection with the
Transaction contemplated by this Agreement by virtue of such non-assumption
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan) as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (" _Cashed Out Company Options_ ") shall be
cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess of
the Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Company
Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "), without interest and subject
to applicable tax withholdings. Each holder of a Cashed Out Company Option
shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the cancellation thereof the
Option Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such outstanding Cashed Out Company Option and the Company shall
cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Company Option, if a
current or former employee of the Company, through the payroll system of the
Surviving Corporation or, if not a current or former employee of the Company,
through the Paying Agent, in each case, payable as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date (and, in the case of current or former employees of
the Company, in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run
of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date), provided that in the
event that any Cashed Out Company Option is subject to Section 409A of the
Code, as jointly determined by Parent and the Company, the payment of
the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be delayed to the extent
necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 



23 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each In-the-Money Company Option that is
outstanding and unvested, and each Company Option that is not an In-the-Money
Company Option that is outstanding, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and, in each case, is held by an Acquired Company Employee or Acquired
Company Service Provider shall be assumed by Ultimate Parent and converted
automatically at the Effective Time into an option denominated in Ultimate
Parent Ordinary Shares having, subject to Applicable Law, the same terms and
conditions as the Company Option (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "), except that
(i) each such Assumed Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable
in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole Ultimate Parent
Ordinary Shares equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) a fraction (such
ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Merger
Consideration and the denominator of which is the volume weighted average
price for an Ultimate Parent Ordinary Share for the twenty trading days
immediately prior to (and excluding) the Closing Date as reported by
Bloomberg, L.P., and rounding such product down to the nearest whole number of
Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares, (ii) the per share exercise price for
the Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such Assumed
Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (A) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange
Ratio, and rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole cent and (iii) all
references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans and the
stock option agreements will be references to Ultimate Parent. The Company
will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any Company Options
(other than to implement any existing agreements or arrangements for
such acceleration in effect as of the date of this Agreement). As soon as
reasonably practicable, Ultimate Parent will use reasonable best efforts to
issue to each Person who holds an Assumed Option a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Ultimate Parent.

(c) All Company Options which are not Cashed Out Company Options or
Assumed Options shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time in exchange for no consideration. In no event shall the Company Options
described in this Section 3.05(c) be assumed by Ultimate Parent.

 

(d) At the Effective Time each Company RSU Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by an Acquired Company
Employee or Acquired Company Service Provider shall be assumed by Ultimate
Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an award
consisting of that number of restricted share units denominated in Ultimate
Parent Ordinary Shares having, subject to Applicable Law, the same terms and
conditions as the Company RSU Award (each assumed and converted Company RSU
Award, an " _Assumed RSU_ _Award_ "), except that (i) each such Assumed RSU
Award will entitle the holder, upon settlement, to that number of whole
Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable with regard to the related
Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B)
the Exchange Ratio, and

 



24 ##### Table of Contents

  

 rounding such product down to the nearest whole number of Ultimate Parent
Ordinary Shares and (ii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable
Company Stock Plans and the Company RSU Award agreements will be references
to Ultimate Parent. The Company will not take any action to accelerate the
vesting of any portion of any Company RSU Award (other than to implement any
existing agreements or arrangements for such acceleration in effect as of the
date of this Agreement). As soon as reasonably practicable, Ultimate Parent
will issue to each Person who holds an Assumed RSU Award a document evidencing
the foregoing assumption of the related Company RSU Award by Ultimate Parent.

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company RSU Award that is not
an Assumed RSU Award (" _Cashed Out Company RSU Award_ ") shall vest in full
and be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Merger Consideration (the " _RSU Consideration_ "), without interest and
subject to applicable tax withholdings. Each holder of an outstanding Cashed
Out Company RSU Award shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
the cancellation thereof the RSU Consideration with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such outstanding Company RSU Award and the
Company shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Company RSU
Award, if a current or former employee of the Company, through the payroll
system of the Surviving Corporation or, if not a current or former employee of
the Company, through the Paying Agent, in each case, payable as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date (and, in the case of current or former
employees of the Company, in no event later than the next regularly scheduled
payroll run of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date),
_provided_ , that in the event that any Cashed Out Company RSU Award is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, as jointly determined by Parent and the
Company, the payment of the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be
delayed to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(f) As of the Closing Date, each Company PSU Award shall be treated in
accordance with the terms of the Company PSU Award agreement governing such
Company PSU Award, including that (i) the Performance Period (as defined in
the applicable Company PSU Award agreement) in respect of such Company PSU
Award shall be deemed to end on the Closing Date, (ii) the number of
Calculated RSUs (as defined in the applicable Company PSU Award agreement)
shall be determined as of the Closing Date, (iii) 50% of the Calculated RSUs
under the Company PSU Award shall become vested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (iv) the portion of the Company PSU Award covering the
Calculated RSUs shall be treated as a Company RSU Award and in the manner as
specified in Section 3.05(d) or 3.05(e), as applicable, provided that any
such Calculated RSUs that shall be subject to the treatment specified in
Section 3.05(d) shall be scheduled to vest on the one (1) year anniversary of
the Closing Date based on continued Service Provider (as defined in
the CompanyÂ’s 2009 Stock Plan) status through such date, subject to any
accelerated vesting as may be specified under any plan, agreement or other
arrangement applicable to such Company PSU Award. The Company will not take
any action to 

 



25 ##### Table of Contents

  

 accelerate the vesting of any portion of any Company PSU Award (other than
to implement any existing agreements or arrangements for such acceleration in
effect as of the date of this Agreement). 

(g) Not less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
send a written notice in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent to each
holder of an outstanding Company Option, Company PSU Award or Company RSU
Award that shall inform such holder of the treatment of the Company Options,
Company PSU Awards and Company RSU Awards provided in this Section 3.05.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.05 or otherwise in this
Agreement to the contrary, the conversion of Company Options, Company PSU
Award and Company RSU Awards provided for in this Section 3.05 shall be
effected in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(i) Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory
Award or any participant in any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee
Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment
agreement shall have any right hereunder to acquire any capital stock or other
equity interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights)
in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

 Section 3.06 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(a), but shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares. If any such Person shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL,
then the right of such Person to receive those rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL shall cease and such shares shall be deemed automatically to have
been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to represent only, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(a),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of a Stock Certificate or Book-Entry
Share representing such shares in accordance with Section 3.02.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to the DGCL. Parent
shall have the right to participate in, direct and control all negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with

 the prior written consent of Parent, (i) voluntarily make any payment or
settlement offer with respect to any demands, applications, notices or
instruments for appraisal for Dissenting Shares, (ii) settle or offer to
settle any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand or to timely take any other action for appraisal in accordance with the
DGCL or (iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.

works council or similar organization to organize any employees of the
Acquired Companies. Each Acquired Company is in compliance with all Applicable
Laws regarding employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, employment safety and health, immigration, wages and hours, and

Company or any Representative of any Acquired Company from any Person (other

Company determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions
or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make

Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any Change of Board
Recommendation proposed to be made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal may
only be made pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 6.03(g))
if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of an Intervening Event
and taking into account the results of any negotiations with Parent as
contemplated by clause (ii) below and any offer from Parent contemplated by
clause (iii) below, that such action is necessary to comply with fiduciary
duties owed by the Company Board of Directors to the stockholders of the
Company under the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board
of Directors may not make a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to the
foregoing unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at
least four Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_
"), of the CompanyÂ’s intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation (it
being understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the Company Board
of DirectorsÂ’ reason for proposing to effect such Change of Board
Recommendation;

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the Intervening
Event Notice Period negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Company
Board of Directors to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and

 

(iii) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned four Business Day
period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of
such period)

 offer to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Company
Board of Directors has in good faith determined (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) would obviate the need for
the Company Board of Directors to effect such Change of Board Recommendation.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving
effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be
offered by Parent (including pursuant to clause (ii) below), the Company Board
of Directors may at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such
action is necessary to comply with fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board
of Directors to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL, (y) effect a
Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal or (z)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless the Company complies with the provisions of
Section 9.01(g) and Section 9.03 in the time frames specified therein; and
_provided_ , _further_ that the Company Board of Directors may not effect a
Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) unless (A) the
Acquired Companies shall not have materially breached this Section 6.03 with
respect to such Superior Proposal or the party making such Superior Proposal
and (B):

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at
least four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the
CompanyÂ’s intention to take any action permitted under clause (y) or (z) above
with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and all other
material documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any revisions to the
Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.03(g)

 



63 ##### Table of Contents

  

 with respect to such new written notice, except that references to the four
Business Day period above shall be deemed references to a two Business Day
period.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, any actions taken by the Company in accordance
with this Section 6.03(g) shall not be deemed to constitute a Change of Board
Recommendation.

(h) Neither the Company nor the Company Board of Directors shall take
any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates) from the provisions of "control share acquisitions"
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL or any other Anti-Takeover Law
or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such
actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.01(g).

 

(i) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 6.03 by any Representative of any of the Acquired Companies
(other than any employee or consultant of an Acquired Company who is not a
director, executive or other officer of an Acquired Company) shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Agreement (including this Section 6.03) by the
Company.

(j) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company will send
a notice (which may be delivered via email) to direct employees of the
Acquired Companies to comply with the terms of Section 6.03(a) and Section

the content of such notice shall be mutually agreed to by Parent and the
Company and shall include finance, business development and legal employees.

Acquired Company to (a) give Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
to the offices, properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies, (b)
furnish to Parent and its Representatives such financial and operating data
and other information relating to the Acquired Companies as such Persons may
reasonably request and (c) instruct the Representatives of the Acquired
Companies to cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the Acquired
Companies; provided, however, that the Acquired Companies shall not be
required to provide access to any information or documents which would, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company (after consultation with outside legal
counsel), (i) breach any agreement with any Person to which the Acquired
Companies are party or otherwise bound, (ii) constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client or other privilege held by any of the Acquired Companies, or
(iii) otherwise violate any Applicable Law (it being agreed that the Company
shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such
information or documents pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) above and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate (including by
entering into a joint defense or similar agreement) to cause such information
to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the
applicable privilege or protection or violate the applicable restriction). Any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be conducted in such manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Acquired

 



64 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Companies and shall be subject to the CompanyÂ’s reasonable security
measures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not have access to
personnel records of the Acquired Companies relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information, the
disclosure of which would result in the violation of Applicable Law.

Company otherwise in writing no later than five Business Days prior to the

the applicable Acquired Company) shall adopt resolutions

Employee Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and containing a Code
Section 401(k) cash or deferred arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "). Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with executed
resolutions of its Board of Directors (or the board of directors of the
applicable Acquired Company) authorizing such termination and amending any
such 401(k) Plan commensurate with its termination to the extent necessary to
comply with all Applicable Laws. The Company shall also take (and shall cause
each applicable Acquired Company to take) such other actions in furtherance of
the termination of each 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require.

execution nor the consummation of the Potential Asset Sale Transactions or

will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, to consummate the
Merger.

governing documents) or in any agreement between any Acquired Company and
such DandO Indemnitee, shall survive the Transaction and shall continue in full

78 ##### Table of Contents

  

 indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights of any DandO Indemnitee, except as required by Applicable
Law.

liability coverage of the CompanyÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’

reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the CompanyÂ’s current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance in an amount and scope at least
as favorable as the CompanyÂ’s existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall the cost of such policies exceed 250% of the last annual
premium paid therefor prior to the Effective Time; _provided_   _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.05 shall survive the Closing and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnitee, and nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification
rights that any such DandO Indemnitee may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of any Acquired Company or any Contract or
Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the obligations under this Section 7.05 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee without the consent
of such DandO Indemnitee.

 

(d) In the event that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to any other
person, then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns,
if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall,
unless such corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if
applicable) is otherwise bound by the obligations set forth in this Section
7.05 by Applicable Law, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.

 

Section 7.06 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take such actions as are required to cause the disposition of
Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company PSU Awards, Company RSU Awards
or other convertible securities in connection with the Merger by each

Section 7.07 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall (i) as promptly
as practicable (and in any event, within two Business Days after Knowledge of
the Company or any of the members of its Board of Directors of receipt) inform
Parent orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation or other
Proceedings brought or threatened in writing against the Company or any of its
directors or officers relating to the Transaction and keep Parent fully
informed with respect to the status thereof (including by promptly furnishing
to Parent and its Representatives such information relating to such
stockholder litigation as such Persons may reasonably request, including all
pleadings with respect thereto), (ii) give Parent the opportunity and right
to participate in the defense of any such stockholder litigation at ParentÂ’s
sole cost and expense, including in any and all Proceedings related to any
such stockholder litigation and any proposed settlement or disposition thereof

Section 7.08 Employee Matters.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Ultimate Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each Acquired
Company Employee with base salary, bonus opportunity, severance, health and
welfare benefits which are no less favorable than the base salary, bonus
opportunity, severance, health and welfare benefits, respectively, that each
such Acquired Company Employee is entitled or eligible to receive from any
Acquired Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Ultimate Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
Ultimate Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the
extent permitted under such plans and under Applicable Law, to grant all of
the Acquired Company Employees credit for any service with such Acquired
Company earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting
purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit
determinations under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that may be established or that is maintained by Ultimate Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the
Closing Date (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or frozen
benefit plan or vesting under any equity incentive plan) to the same extent as
such Acquired Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar plan in which such Acquired Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized
or credited to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits provided to the Acquired Company Employee, for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent that
such service was not recognized under any similar Employee Plan of the Company
in which the Acquired Company Employee participated or was eligible to

Section 10.02 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. The rights and
remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled to at law or in equity, in each case without the
requirement of posting any bond or other type of security. Each of the parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other
party has an adequate remedy at law.

 

Section 10.03 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered at the Closing pursuant hereto shall not survive the
Effective Time.

 

Section 10.04 Amendments and Waivers.

Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in

 Approval which requires further approval of the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the DGCL without such further stockholder approval.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 10.05 Disclosure Schedule References. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding
Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of
such party that are contained in this Agreement, but in the case of clause
(b) only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be
reasonably apparent to an individual who has read that reference and such
representations and warranties. The listing of any matter on a partyÂ’s
disclosure schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by such
party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required
to be disclosed by such party under this Agreement or falls within relevant
minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No
disclosure in a partyÂ’s disclosure schedule relating to any possible breach
or violation by such party of any Contract or Applicable Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter
in a partyÂ’s disclosure schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope
of such partyÂ’s representations, warranties and/or covenants set forth in this
Agreement.

inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors

liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that, after the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub may
transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole
or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any
time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such
transfer or assignment shall not relieve Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub
of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of
any other party hereto or due to Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Section 10.06(b) shall be void.
