(a) _Conversion of the Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any

which an election to receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") is
properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 4.2_ (each, a "

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that the sum of (A) the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (excluding
Stock Election Shares held by Tres Investment Company and S. Byrl Ross
Enterprises, Inc.) plus (B) the Related Pro Forma Stock Election Shares
(collectively, the " _Aggregate Stock Election Shares_ "), exceeds 5,474,420,
then, without any further action of the parties hereto, each Stock Election
Share (excluding Stock Election Shares held by Tres Investment Company and S.
Byrl Ross Enterprises, Inc.) shall be converted into a right to receive (A) a
number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Shares (the "
_Adjusted Exchange Ratio_ ") equal to (1) the Exchange Ratio _minus_  (2) (x)
the difference between (i) the Aggregate Stock Election Shares _minus_ (ii)
5,474,420 times (y) the Exchange Ratio _divided by_ (z) the Aggregate Stock
Election Shares, and (B) an amount of cash equal to (1) the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration _minus_ (2) the product of (x) the Adjusted Exchange
Ratio _times_ (y) the Assumed Share Value. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Stock Election Shares held
by Tres Investment Company or S. Byrl Ross Enterprises, Inc. be subject to the
foregoing adjustment.



(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that the Aggregate Stock Election Shares is less than 3,864,296, then,
without any further action by the parties hereto, each Cash Election Share and
each No Election Share shall be converted into a right to receive (A) a number
of validly issued fully paid and non-assessable Parent Shares (the " _Cash
Election Exchange Ratio_ ") equal to (1) the difference between (x) 3,864,296
_minus_ (y) the Aggregate Stock Election Shares _times_ (2) the Exchange Ratio
_times_ (3) the Merger Cash Percentage _divided by_ (3) the aggregate number
of Cash Election Shares and No Election Shares, and (B) an amount of cash
equal to the difference between (1) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration
_minus_ (2) the product of (x) the Cash Election Exchange Ratio _times_ (y)
the Assumed Share Value.



(b) _Conversion of Company Purchase Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Companys Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary to
(i) provide for the cancellation or exercise, effective at the Effective Time,
of all the outstanding options, warrants, subscription rights, conversion
rights, purchase rights or any other right that grants the holder thereof the
right to receive or purchase Company Common Shares, whether or not exercisable
and whether or not vested (each, a " _Company Purchase Rights_ ") without any
payment therefor except as otherwise provided in this _Section 4.1(b)_, and
(ii) terminate the Company Purchase Plans as of the Effective Time. Each
Company Purchase Right, to the extent unexercised as of the Effective Time
(excluding any Company Purchase Right described in _Section 4.1(d)_), shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof no longer be exercisable and,  



 

4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 upon execution of a termination and waiver letter in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, shall be converted into the right to receive the
following consideration in cancellation and settlement therefor:



(i) Each Company Purchase Right Share for which a Cash Election has been
effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 4.2_, and each
No Election Share with respect to any applicable Company Purchase Rights
Share, shall be converted into the right to receive a payment equal to the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (subject to
adjustment pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(iii)_ and _(iv)_ above) over the
exercise (or unpaid portion of the purchase) price per Company Common Share
subject to such Company Purchase Right.



(ii) Each Company Purchase Right Share for which a Stock Election was made and
not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 4.2_ shall be converted into a
number of Parent Shares calculated pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(ii)_ (subject
to adjustment pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(iii)_ and _(iv)_ above);
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the calculation of the Exchange
Ratio or the Adjusted Exchange Ratio, as applicable, the "Per Share Cash
Election Consideration" shall be deemed to be the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Cash Election Consideration over the exercise (or unpaid portion of the
purchase) price per Company Common Share subject to such Company Purchase
Right.



(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
membership interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the holder thereof be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, no
par value of the Surviving Entity.



(d)  _Dissenting Shares_. To the extent that holders thereof are entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 31D-13-1302 of the WVBCA, Company Common Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has properly exercised and perfected such holders demand for
appraisal rights under Section 31D-13-1323 of the WVBCA (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
receive from the Surviving Entity such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 31D-13-1324 of the WVBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall effectively withdraw or
lose such holders right to appraisal and payment under the WVBCA, each of
such holders Company Common Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such  



 

5 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company Common Shares and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares.



 4.2 _Election Procedures_.



(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
in such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed together with the Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 or at such other time as the Company and Parent may
agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Company Common
Shares as of the close of business on the record date for notice of the
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Form Record Date_ ") and to each holder
of Company Purchase Rights as of the Mailing Date.



(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of such holders
Company Common Shares and Company Purchase Rights Shares with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Election Consideration,
(ii) the number of such holders Company Common Shares and Company Purchase
Rights Shares with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration, or (iii) that such holder makes no election with
respect to such holders Company Common Shares and Company Purchase Rights
Shares (the " _No Election Shares_ "). Any Company Common Shares and Company
Purchase Rights Shares with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not
received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00
p.m., New York time, on the twentieth Business Day following the Mailing Date
(or such other time and date as Parent and the Company shall agree) (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") (other than any Company Common Shares and Company
Purchase Rights Shares that constitute Dissenting Shares as of such time)
shall also be deemed to be No Election Shares.



(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Shares or Company Purchase Rights Shares
between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the
Business Day prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to
the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as
specified herein.



 

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person
submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form
is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the Company Common Shares and
Company Purchase Rights Shares represented by such Election Form shall  



 

6 ##### Table of Contents

  

 become No Election Shares, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent
election is properly made with respect to any or all of such Company Common
Shares and Company Purchase Rights Shares. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election
Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. With respect to any Election Form
received by the Escrow Agent no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Election Deadline, the Company, and the Exchange Agent shall exercise
reasonable diligence to notify any Person of any defect in such Election Form,
and each such Person shall be permitted to correct any such defect or defects
in the Election Form prior to the Election Deadline.



 4.3 _Surrender and Payment; Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint The Bank of New York or
such other exchange agent acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_
") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates representing Company Common
Shares ("Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. Parent will make
available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, (i) an aggregate amount of cash
equal to the product of (A) the aggregate Cash Election Shares _times_ (B) the
Per Share Cash Election Consideration to be delivered in respect of the Fully-
Diluted Company Common Shares (as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(ii))
and (ii) the Escrowed Merger Consideration to be held in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. To the extent not received prior to the
Effective Time, promptly thereafter, Parent will send, or will cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each Fully-Diluted Stockholder as of the Effective
Time (other than any holder which has previously and properly surrendered all
of its Certificates(s) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with _Section
4.2_ (each, an " _Electing Stockholder_ ")), a letter of transmittal for use
in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company and Parent
may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of such Fully-Diluted
Company Common Shares to the Exchange Agent.



(b) Each Fully-Diluted Company Common Share that has been converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon (i) with respect to any
Electing Stockholder, completion of the calculations required by _Section
4.1(a)_ or (ii) with respect to any holder that is not an Electing
Stockholder, surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with
a properly completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (A)
one or more Parent Shares (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of Parent Shares, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ and (B) a check or wire transfer to an
account designated by any Fully Diluted Stockholder in the amount equal to
the cash portion of the Merger  



 

7 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 4.1(a)_ and this _Section 4.3_, including cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 4.4_ and dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on
any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time,
represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration. 



(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the
name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such
registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Common Shares or Company Purchase Rights. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Entity or the Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this  _Article IV_.



(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration (other than the Escrowed Merger
Consideration) made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
4.1(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders one year
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any
such holder who has not exchanged his Company Common Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 4.3_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such holders shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
not be liable to any holder of shares for any Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. Any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by Fully-Diluted Stockholders five
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.



(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares issued
in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates
until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this _Section 4.3_.
Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of
such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of
such Parent Shares with a  



 

8 ##### Table of Contents

  

 record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or
other distributions in respect of Parent Shares, all Parent Shares to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.



(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ to pay for Company Common Shares for which
appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.



(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Exchange
Agent shall not pay to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders an aggregate amount of
the Merger Consideration equal to (i) the Indemnity Escrow _plus_ (ii) the
Adjustment Holdback until such time as such amounts are distributable pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement (the " _Escrowed Merger Consideration_ ").



 4.4 _Fractional Shares_.



(a) No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each Fully-Diluted Stockholder otherwise entitled to a fractional
Parent Share will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent
in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 4.4_, a cash payment in
lieu of such fractional Parent Share representing such holders proportionate
interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one
or more transactions of Parent Shares equal to the excess of (x) the
aggregate number of Parent Shares to be issued by Parent pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement over (y) the aggregate number of whole Parent Shares to be
distributed to the holders of Fully-Diluted Company Common Shares hereunder
(such excess being herein called the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Certificates representing
Company Common Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices
on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided in the
following paragraph.



(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be executed on
the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. The compensation payable to the
Exchange Agent and the expenses incurred by the Exchange Agent, in each case,
 



 

9 ##### Table of Contents

  

 in connection with such sale or sales of the Excess Shares, and all related
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, will
be paid by the Surviving Entity out of its own funds and will not be paid
directly or indirectly by Parent, nor charged against Fully Diluted
Stockholders. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed
to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the Exchange Agent shall hold such
proceeds in trust for the Fully-Diluted Stockholders (the " _Common Shares
Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares
Trust to which each Fully-Diluted Stockholder shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares
Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
share interest to which such Fully-Diluted Stockholder would otherwise be
entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
share interests to which all Fully-Diluted Stockholders would otherwise be
entitled.



(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to Fully-Diluted Stockholders in lieu of any fractional Parent
Shares, the Exchange Agent shall pay such amounts to such Fully-Diluted
Stockholders without interest, subject to and in accordance with  _Section
4.3_.



 4.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent
or the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company
Common Shares represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article
IV_.



 4.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Entity and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this _Article IV_ such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of any Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be,
and paid over to the applicable governmental entity, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may
be.



 4.7 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any  



 

10 ##### Table of Contents

  

 of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.



 4.8 _Adjustment Holdback_.



(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company shall prepare and deliver a certificate (the
" _Adjustment Certificate_ ") to Parent setting forth the Companys estimated
calculation of Net Indebtedness and Transaction Costs as of the Effective
Time. Such calculation shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a
basis using the same methods, principles, practices and policies used in the
preparation of the Financial Statements and shall be acceptable to Parent in
its sole discretion. The aggregate amounts set forth in such Adjustment
Certificate are hereafter referred to as the " _Estimated Adjustments_." At
Closing, an aggregate amount equal to the sum of $5,000,000 in cash (the "
_Adjustment Holdback_ "), shall be deducted from the Merger Consideration
otherwise to be paid by the Exchange Agent to the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders pursuant to _Section 4.3_. For the avoidance of doubt, each
Fully-Diluted Stockholder shall only be obligated to contribute such Fully-
Diluted Stockholders pro rata portion (based on the Fully-Diluted Company
Common Shares) of the Merger Consideration to the Adjustment Holdback.



(b) Within fifteen (15) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Holders Representative a certificate setting forth Parents
calculation of Net Indebtedness and Transaction Costs. Such calculation shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP using the same methods, principles,
practices and policies as was required to be used in the preparation of the
Estimated Adjustments. The aggregate amounts set forth in such certificate are
hereafter referred to as the " _Actual Adjustments_." Within ten (10) days of
receipt of the Parents calculation of the Actual Adjustments, the Holders
Representative may provide notice that it disagrees with the
Parents calculation of the Actual Adjustments. If such notice is delivered,
Parent and the Holders Representative shall have ten (10) days from the
delivery of the notice to agree on the Actual Adjustments. If the Parent and
Holder Representative do not agree, then the matter shall be submitted to an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm selected in writing by
Parent and Holder Representative who shall make a final determination of the
Actual Adjustments within thirty (30) days of submission of the matter to it.



(c) In the event the Actual Adjustments exceed the Estimated Adjustments, the
Holders Representative and Parent shall promptly direct the Exchange Agent to
disburse an aggregate amount of the Adjustment Holdback equal to such excess
to Parent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ ,
in the event such difference is in excess of the Adjustment Holdback, such
excess shall first be deducted from the Indemnity Escrow. In the event the
Estimated Adjustments exceed the Actual Adjustments, Parent shall promptly
pay to the Exchange Agent an amount in cash equal to such excess and direct
the Exchange Agent to disburse such excess amount and the Adjustment  



 

11 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Holdback to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders in accordance with _Sections
4.10(b)_ and pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, Parent shall pay such excess amount (i) with respect to the initial
$3,000,000 (the "Initial Excess") of such excess amount, in cash and (ii) with
respect to such excess amounts in excess of $3,000,000 (the " _Extra Excess_
"), in the form of an aggregate amount of Parent Shares equal to (x) the Extra
Excess _divided by_ (y) the Assumed Share Value; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , if the Merger Consideration is less than $430,000,000, the
Initial Excess shall not be paid in cash, but shall be paid in the form of an
aggregate amount of Parent Shares equal to (i) the amount of the Initial
Excess divided by (ii) the Assumed Share Value. In no event shall any payment
pursuant to the prior sentence be made in cash to the extent it would cause
the ratio of (i) the value of the shares received as a result of Stock
Elections (other than by S. Byrl Ross Enterprises, Inc. and Tres Investment
Company) pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(ii)_ or _Section 4.11_ based on the
Assumed Share Value over (ii) the sum of the Merger Consideration _plus_ the
cash to be otherwise paid pursuant to the prior sentence to be less than
.42. 



(d) The remaining amount of the Adjustment Holdback, if any, after payment to
Parent pursuant to _Section 4.8(c)_ shall be disbursed by the Exchange Agent
in accordance with _Section 4.10(b)_ and pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.



 4.9 _Indemnity Escrow_. At Closing, an aggregate amount equal to the sum of
$10,000,000 in cash (the " _Indemnity Escrow_ "), shall be deducted from the
Merger Consideration otherwise to be paid by the Exchange Agent to the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders pursuant to _Section 4.3_. The Indemnity Escrow shall be
disbursed by the Exchange Agent in accordance with _Section 4.10(b)_ and
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
each Fully-diluted Stockholder shall only be obligated to contribute such
Fully-Diluted Stockholders pro rata portion (based on the Fully-Diluted
Company Common Shares) of the Merger Consideration to the Indemnity Escrow.



 4.10 _Escrowed Merger Consideration_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Exchange
Agent shall not pay to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders that portion of the
Merger Consideration to be deposited in the Indemnity Escrow or the
Adjustment Holdback until such time as such amounts are distributable pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement.



(b) The amount of any distributions or payments to be made to, or on behalf
of, a Fully-Diluted Stockholder from the Indemnity Escrow or the Adjustment
Holdback pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement will be determined
based on the percentage ownership (calculated on a fully-diluted basis) of
Company Common Shares and Company Purchase Rights Shares owned by such Fully-
Diluted Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.



 

12 ##### Table of Contents

  

 4.11 _Stock Election_. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event that the aggregate number of Company Common Shares
to be exchanged for Parent Shares upon receipt of the Stock Elections
pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(ii)_ of this Agreement is less than 2,750,000
(excluding for this purpose any Company Common Shares owned by S. Byrl Ross
Enterprises, Inc. and Tres Investment Company), then, upon delivery of
written notice by the Parent to each Principal Stockholder (the " _Notice_
"), each Principal Stockholder shall be deemed, without any further action by
such Principal Stockholder and notwithstanding any prior election, to have
made a Stock Election under this Agreement with respect to an aggregate
number of Shares Beneficially Owned (the " _Additional Share Amount_ ") by
such Principal Stockholder such that the aggregate number of Company Common
Shares to be exchanged for Parent Shares pursuant to an election under
_Section 4.11(a)(ii)_ (excluding Company Common Shares owned by S. Byrl Ross
Enterprises, Inc. and Tres Investment Company) will equal 2,750,000 (after
giving effect to each other Voting Agreement executed by a Principal
Stockholder thereunder); _provided_ , that each Principal Stockholder shall be
allocated an aggregate amount of Additional Share Amounts based on the
aggregate number of Shares Beneficially Owned by such Principal Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time as compared to the aggregate number of
Shares Beneficially Owned by all Principal Stockholders (excluding for this
purpose Company Common Shares owned by S. Byrl Ross Enterprises, Inc. and
Tres Investment Company) subject to Voting Agreements, subject to rounding to
the nearest whole number. The Notice to be delivered by Parent shall set forth
the Additional Share Amount for the Stockholder and each other Principal
Stockholder subject to Voting Agreements.



 4.12 _Continuity of Interest_. This Agreement is intended to meet the
requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.368-1(e) (including Treasury
Regulation section 1.368-1(e)(2)(iii)(B)) and shall be interpreted in
a manner consistent therewith, such that in no event shall the number of
Company Common Shares (included for purposes of "continuity of interest"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.368(a)-1(e)) exchanged for
Parent Shares (based on the fair market value of Parent Shares on the day
before the date hereof) constitute less than 41% of the proprietary interests
in the Company.

information) or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal which constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal from any Person, or engage in any discussion or
negotiations relating thereto or accept any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
will as promptly as practicable communicate to Parent any inquiry received by

_Company Acquisition Transaction_."



 6.3 _Preparation of Form S-4 and Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meeting_.



(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
the proxy statement with respect to the vote by the Companys stockholders
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Proxy Statement_ "), and Parent shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Form S-4 to register the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger
(the " _Form S-4_ "). Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is

taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the
registration and qualification of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information relating to the Company
and its stockholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action. The information provided and to be provided by Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company, respectively, (i) for use in the Form S-4, at the time
the Form S-4 becomes effective, shall be true and correct in all material
respects and shall not omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make such information not misleading and (ii) for use
in the Proxy Statement, on the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
Companys stockholders and on the date of the Stockholders Meeting referred

omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make such information, in the light of the circumstances under which
the statements therein were made, not misleading, and the Company and Parent
each agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Form S-4
and the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading.

hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its Real Property,
assets, books and records and, during such period, shall and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to furnish promptly to such Authorized Representatives all
information concerning their business, Real Property, assets and personnel;
_provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_

Property, and agrees to provide any support and to take any actions reasonably
requested by Parent in this regard. Parent agrees to treat any and all
information provided pursuant to this  _Section 6.4_ in compliance with the
terms of that certain Confidentiality Agreement, entered by and between the
Company and Parent, dated October 31, 2005 (as amended, the " _Confidentiality

which relate to the ownership of any Company Owned Real Property (including
title reports and surveys) or the condition thereof with respect to any
environmental laws received by or on behalf of Parent or by or on behalf of
any Person, attorney, accountant, agent or independent contractor acting for
or on behalf of Parent. Any entry by Parent, its Authorized Representatives,

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause its Authorized Representatives to return each
test location to substantially its original condition; and

omissions of Parent or any of its Authorized Representatives while on the Real
Property prior to Closing, unless such claims or damage results from the
gross neglect or willful misconduct of the Company; _provided_ , nothing
herein shall be deemed to mitigate the indemnity obligations of the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders  



 

47 ##### Table of Contents

  

 herein. Parents obligation to so indemnify the Company pursuant to the
foregoing provisions shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 



 6.5 _Publicity_. The Parties agree that they will consult with each other
concerning any proposed press release or public announcement pertaining to
this Agreement or the Merger in order to agree upon the text of any such

exchange or national automated quotation system, in which case the Party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall
use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with Parent or the
Company, as applicable, before issuing any such press release or making any
such public announcement.



 6.6 _Representations and Warranties_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other of any circumstances that would cause any of
their respective representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 5.1_
or _5.2_ , as the case may be, not to be true and correct in all material
respects at and as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , that delivery of such

 6.9 _Tax Matters_.



(a) Subject to _Section 8.1_, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall, jointly
and severally, indemnify Parent, the Company and the Surviving Entity for all
Taxes of the Company (including Taxes of any other person for which
the Company is liable as a result of transferee liability, joint and several
liability, under a contract, or otherwise) other than Company Taxes, if any,
that arise as a result of the Merger or the Subsequent Merger (which shall not
be the responsibility of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders) to the extent such
Taxes are not adequately provided for as current taxes on the Companys Recent
Financial Statements (i) for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and (ii) for any period not ending on or before the Closing Date, for
the portion of any Taxes attributable to the period ending on the Closing
Date.



(b) For any period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, (i)
liability for any Taxes determined by reference to income, capital gains,
gross income, gross receipts, sales, net profits, windfall profits or similar
items or resulting from a transfer of assets shall be allocated between the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders and the Company based on the date on which such
items accrued; and (ii) liability for all other Taxes shall be allocated
between the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and the Company, pro rata based on the
number of days in the taxable period for which each party is liable for Taxes
hereunder. 



(c) The Holders Representative shall cause the Company to prepare and file
all Tax Returns of the Company due on or prior to the Closing Date, which
returns and reports shall be prepared and filed timely and on a basis
consistent with existing procedures for preparing such returns and
reports and in a manner consistent with prior practice with respect to the
treatment of specific items on the returns or reports; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the treatment of an item on any such return or report has not been
provided by prior practice, the Holders Representative shall cause the
Company to report such items in a manner that would result in the least amount
of Tax liability to the Company and Parent for periods ending after the
Closing Date. Parent shall cause the Company to prepare and file all Tax
Returns of the Company due after the Closing Date, which returns and reports,
to the extent they relate to taxable periods beginning prior to, but including
the Closing Date, and for the purpose of determining the liability for Taxes
of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, shall be prepared and filed timely and on a
basis consistent with existing procedures for preparing such returns and in a
manner consistent with prior practice with respect to the treatment
of specific items on the returns and reports, unless such treatment does not
have sufficient legal support to avoid the imposition of penalties. In the
event the Fully-Diluted Stockholders are liable under _Section 6.9(a)_ hereof
for Taxes due in connection with the returns described in the preceding
sentence, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall pay the amount of such
liability to the Company immediately upon request or at least three (3)
business days prior to the filing of such returns, whichever is later.



 

49 ##### Table of Contents

  

(d) Parent, the Company and the Holders Representative shall provide each
other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the others in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to liabilities for Taxes. Such assistance shall include
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information or explanation of material provided hereunder and shall
include providing copies of relevant tax returns and supporting material. The
party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the assisting party for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing assistance. Parent,
the Company and the Holders Representative will retain for the full period of
any statute of limitations and provide the others with any records or
information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit, examination,
proceeding or determination.



(e) If in connection with any examination, investigation, audit or other
proceeding in respect of any Tax Return covering the operations of the
Company on or before the Closing Date, any Governmental Authority issues to
the Company a written notice of deficiency, a notice of reassessment, a
proposed adjustment, an assertion of claim or demand concerning the taxable
period covered by such return, Parent or the Company shall notify the Holders
Representative of its receipt of such communication from the Governmental
Authority within thirty (30) business days after receiving such notice
of deficiency, reassessment, adjustment or assertion of claim or demand. No
failure or delay of Parent or the Company in the performance of the foregoing
shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that
such failure or delay shall preclude the Holders Representative from defending
against any liability or claim for Taxes that the Fully-Diluted Stockholders
are obligated to pay hereunder. Except as provided below, the Holders
Representative shall, at its expense, have the nonexclusive right to
participate in the contest of any such assessment, proposal, claim,
reassessment, demand or other proceedings in connection with any Tax
Return covering taxable periods of the Company ending on or before the
Closing Date. Parent and the Company will not be obligated to settle or
resolve any issue related to Taxes for such a period, which, if so settled or
resolved, could have an effect on the Company or Parent for periods after the
Closing Date, unless the Holders Representative agrees in writing with Parent
and the Company, in terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company,
that the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall indemnify Parent, any affiliate of
Parent, and the Company from any cost, damage, loss or expense relating to
such settlement or resolution. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if any examination, investigation, audit or other proceeding
relates to a Tax Return for a period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall solely participate in, control and
resolve such examination, investigation, audit or other proceeding,
provided that Parent shall communicate with the Holders Representative
regarding the status of such examination, investigation, audit or proceeding.



 

50 ##### Table of Contents

  

(f) If there is an adjustment to any Tax Return for the Company which creates
a deficiency in any Taxes for which the Fully-Diluted Stockholders are liable
under the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_ hereof, the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders shall pay to Parent the amount of such deficiency in Taxes. No
liability of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders under this _Section 6.9(f)_
shall be payable until the occurrence of any action by any Tax authority that
is final or, if not final, is acquiesced in by the Holders Representative
during the course of any audit or any proceeding relating to Taxes.



(g) All federal, state, local, foreign and other transfer, sales, use or
similar Taxes applicable to, imposed upon or arising out of the transfer of
the Company Common Shares or any other transaction contemplated by this

information that Parent requests to allow Parent to comply with Code Section

certificate duly completed and executed pursuant to Sections 1.897-2(h) and

Company are not United States real property interests within the meaning
of Section 897(c) of the Code.

Stockholder Indemnified Party or by a Parent Indemnified Party, Parent shall
undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, the
