-iv-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of June 3, 2012 by and among salesforce.com, inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Bullseye Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Buddy Media, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a
Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as stockholder
representative (the "Stockholder Representative"). All capitalized terms that
are used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
thereto in Annex A.

W I T N E S S E T H: 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
believe it is advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its
respective stockholders that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") and, in
furtherance thereof, have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, as more fully set forth
herein, in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
premises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and subject to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation."

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, the Merger shall be consummated at a closing
(the "Closing") on the later of (a) a date within two (2) Business Days
following satisfaction or waiver (if permissible hereunder) of the conditions
set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to satisfaction or waiver (if
permissible hereunder) of those conditions), or (b) August 13, 2012, at the
offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, One Market, Spear Tower, Suite
3300, San Francisco, California, unless another time or place is mutually
agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company. The date upon which the
Closing actually occurs shall be referred to herein as the "Closing Date." On
the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing a Certificate of Merger, in substantially the form attached hereto
as Exhibit A, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Certificate of Merger") in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law (the time of such filing and acceptance by the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or such other later time as may be agreed in
writing by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and specified in the Certificate
of Merger, shall be referred to herein as the "Effective Time"). 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time
to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of
incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation
is Buddy Media, Inc."

(b) _Bylaws_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 

1.5 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) _Directors_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold the office of a director of the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.

 

(b) _Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the provisions of the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.6 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock of Constituent Corporations_.

 

(a) _Effect on Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Effect on Company Capital Stock_.

(i) _Company Capital Stock Held by Accredited Investors_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger
Sub, the Company or the Stockholders, each share of Company Capital Stock
(excluding (A) shares of Company Capital Stock held by Unaccredited
Investors, which shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section
1.6(b)(ii),

 



-2-   (B) Company Restricted Stock, which shall be treated in the manner set forth
in Section 1.6(b)(iii), (C) Cancelled Shares, which shall be treated in the
manner set forth in Section 1.6(b)(iv), and (D) Dissenting Shares, which
shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 1.6(b)(v)) issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and extinguished and shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive, upon the terms set forth in this Section 1.6(b)(i) and throughout
this Agreement (including the escrow holdback and indemnification provisions
set forth in this Agreement) and surrender of the certificate representing
such shares of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7,
the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration
(together, the "Merger Consideration"), less (x) the portion of the Merger
Consideration to be withheld at the Closing and deposited into the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(ii), which will distributed to the former holders
of such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with, and subject to,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (y)
the cash to be withheld and deposited with the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(iv), which will be distributed to the former
holders of such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of cash payable and shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to each Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.6(b)(i), (x) all
shares of the Company Capital Stock held by each such Stockholder shall be
aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate basis, (y) the amount of cash to
be paid to each Stockholder for each Company share certificate held by such
Stockholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent, and (z) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to each Stockholder in
exchange for each Company share certificate held by such Stockholder shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number. No fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger. Any Stockholder who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock shall receive an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (A) such fraction _by_ (B) the Parent Trading Price, rounded
down to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) _Company Capital Stock Held by Unaccredited Investors_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger
Sub, the Company or the Stockholders, each share of Company Capital Stock
(excluding Dissenting Shares and Company Restricted Stock) issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by an
Unaccredited Investor shall be cancelled and extinguished and shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive, upon the terms set forth in
this Section 1.6(b)(ii) and throughout this Agreement (including the escrow
holdback and indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement) and
surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock
in the manner provided in Section 1.7 hereof, a cash payment equal to the Per
Share Consideration, less (x) the portion of the Merger Consideration to be
withheld at the Closing and deposited into the Escrow Fund pursuant
to Section 1.7(b)(ii), which will distributed to the former holders of such
shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with, and subject to, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (y) the cash to
be withheld and deposited with the Stockholder Representative pursuant to
Section 1.7(b)(iv), which will be distributed to the former holders of such
shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with, and subject to, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. For purposes of calculating the aggregate
amount of cash payable to each Stockholder pursuant to this Section
1.6(b)(ii), (x) all shares of the Company Capital Stock held by each such
Stockholder shall be aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate basis, and
(y) the amount of cash to be paid to each Stockholder for each Company share
certificate held by such Stockholder shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole cent.

 

(iii) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
Stockholders, each share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished
and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, upon the
terms set forth in this Section 1.6(b)(iii) and throughout this Agreement and
surrender of the certificate

 



-3-   representing such shares of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in
Section 1.7 hereof, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each share of
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section 1.6(b)(iii) shall continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting
terms) set forth in the Plan, if applicable, and the Company Restricted Stock
agreements relating thereto, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(iv) _Cancelled Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
Stockholders, each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and
outstanding and held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than Escrowed Shares
("Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled without any consideration paid
therefor.

(v) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which the holder
thereof has properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262
of Delaware Law, and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
appraisal rights under Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"),
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable
consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in Section 1.6(b)(i),
Section 1.6(b)(ii) or Section 1.6(b)(iii), as applicable, but the holder
thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware
Law. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.6(b)(v), if any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares, upon the terms set forth in this Section 1.6 and throughout this
Agreement (including the escrow holdback and indemnification provisions of
this Agreement), the consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in
Section 1.6(b)(i), Section 1.6(b)(ii) or Section 1.6(b)(iii), as applicable,
without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Except with the prior written consent
of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to any such
demands, or offer to settle or settle such demands, in any case unless such
payment or settlement (A) is paid by the Company in full prior to Closing
(and, therefore, fully reflected in the calculation of Closing Cash
hereunder), (B) only involves the payment of cash prior to the Closing and
does not involve any other non-monetary remedy, and (C) includes as a
condition thereto an unconditional, irrevocable and full release of any and
all appraisal, dissenters or other similar claims, causes of action and
rights (and all related matters) under all applicable Legal Requirements
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Affiliates.

(c)  _Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs_.

(i) _Company Options_.

 

(A) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion
thereof), whether vested or unvested, that is held by a Continuing Employee
and is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be assumed by Parent as a Parent Option. Except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement, each Company Option so assumed by Parent pursuant
to this Section 1.6(c)(i)(A) shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the Plan and
the option agreements relating thereto, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that (x) such assumed Company Option shall be

 



-4-   exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and (y) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock at which such assumed Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the exercise price of the option, the number of shares purchasable
pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall in all events be determined in order to comply with Section 409A
of the Code, and in the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the
Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the
Code, Section 424 of the Code.

(B) Effective as of the Effective Time, (1) each Company Option (or portion
thereof), whether vested or unvested, that is held by a Non-Continuing
Employee, and (2) each Vested Company Option that is held by a Departing
Employee, in each case, that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be immediately
cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 1.6(c)(i)(B) and
throughout this Agreement and in consideration of such cancellation, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the excess of the Per Share
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option over the per share exercise price of such Company Option. Promptly
following the Closing, Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) the cash amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 1.6(c)(i)(B) in respect of such Company
Options.

 

(C) Effective as of the Effective Time, each unvested Company Option that is
held by a Departing Employee and is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of such Departing Employees termination
of employment or service with the Company on or prior to the Effective Time,
be immediately cancelled without the payment of any consideration. 

(ii) _Company RSUs_.

(A) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is held by a
Continuing Employee and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent as a Parent RSU. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each Company RSU so assumed by Parent
pursuant to this Section 1.6(c)(ii)(A) shall continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the
Plan and the Company RSU agreements relating thereto, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that such assumed Company RSU shall cover

immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(B) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is held by a
Non-Continuing Employee and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be immediately cancelled and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Section 1.6(c)(ii)(B) and throughout this
Agreement, in consideration of such cancellation, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Per Share Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU. Promptly following the Closing,
Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) the cash amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 1.6(c)(ii)(B) in respect of such Company RSUs.

 



-5-  (C) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is held by a

employment or service with the Company on or prior to the Effective Time, be
immediately cancelled without the payment of any consideration.

(iii) _Necessary Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to
the review and reasonable approval of Parent, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to effect the transactions anticipated by this Section
1.6(c) under all Company Options, Company RSUs, the Plan, and any other plan
or arrangement of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal),
including determination by the administrator of the Plan that the treatment of
Company Options and Company RSUs as contemplated by this Section 1.6(c) is
permissible under the terms of the Plan and the applicable equity award
agreements, delivering all required notices, obtaining all necessary approvals
and consents, and delivering evidence satisfactory to Parent that all
necessary determinations by the Companys Board of Directors or applicable

Company Options and Company RSUs in accordance with this Section 1.6(c) have
been made.

 

(iv) _Notice_. Within ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, the

to the holders of Company Restricted Stock, Company Options and Company RSUs
in connection with the notice required under this Section 1.6(c)(iv) shall be

unreasonably withhold or delay provided the Company considers in good faith
any comments or proposed revisions made by Parent thereto. 

(v) _No Acceleration_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not resolve
to accelerate the vesting of any Company Restricted Stock, Company Options or

(6) Business Days) after the Closing Date, Parent shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 or another appropriate form (in any case
if available for use by Parent), registering that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of all Company Options and settlement of all Company RSUs,
in each case, that are assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 1.6(c) that are
eligible to be registered on Form S-8 and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as such Company Options or Company RSUs remain outstanding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) in the event that the filing deadline contemplated by
this Section 1.6(c)(vi) shall occur during a trading "blackout" period under
Parents securities trading policies, then Parent shall not be required to
file the registration statement contemplated by this Section 1.6(c)(vi) until
such "blackout" period is no longer applicable, and (B) Parent shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder if Parent shall fail to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.6(c)(vi) at a time when trading
of Parent Common Stock has been suspended globally under Parents then
effective registration statements (it being understood and agreed that if
Parent is unable to file such registration statement on Form S-8 due to a
global trading suspension under Parents then effective registration
statements, then Parent shall file such registration statement as soon as
practicable after trading has been restored).

 



-6-  (d) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Warrant that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, if permissible pursuant to the terms of such Company
Warrant and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, terminate in its entirety.

1.7 _Payment of Merger Consideration for Company Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. US Bank National Association, or another Person selected
by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company, shall serve as the
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the Merger.

(b) _Parent to Provide Merger Consideration, Escrow Amount, BO Earn Out
Amount and Representative Expense Amount_.

(i) At the Effective Time, Parent shall transfer to the Exchange Agent for
exchange in accordance with this Article I the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i) and Section 1.6(b)(ii) in
exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (less the cash amounts to be withheld and
transferred to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(ii) and the cash
amounts to be withheld and transferred to the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(iv)).

(ii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall transfer the Escrow Amount to the
Escrow Agent to hold in trust as an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") under the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Upon deposit of the Escrow
Amount with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the preceding sentence,
Parent shall be deemed to have contributed on behalf of each Stockholder
(other than holders of Company Restricted Stock solely in their capacity as
holders of Company Restricted Stock) its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrow Amount (with respect to each of the cash and stock portions of the
Escrow Amount) to the Escrow Fund.

(iii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall transfer the BO Earn Out Amount to
the Escrow Agent to hold in trust as an escrow fund (the "BO Escrow Fund")
under the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

Amount to the Stockholder Representative to hold in trust as an escrow fund
(the "Representative Escrow Fund") under the terms of this Agreement. Upon

Expense Amount to the Representative Escrow Fund.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) after the Closing Date, Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall mail a letter of transmittal in customary form and
substance to each Stockholder at the address set forth opposite each such
Stockholders name on the Spreadsheet. After delivery to the Exchange Agent of
a letter of transmittal and any other documents (including applicable tax
forms) that Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably require in
connection therewith (the "Exchange Documents"), duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and a certificate
representing shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Company
Stock Certificates"), (i) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate in exchange therefor the cash portion
of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereto pursuant to Section
1.6(b)(i) and Section 1.6(b)(ii) (less the cash amounts to be withheld and
deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(ii) and the
Representative Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(iv)), and (ii) Parent
shall cause its transfer agent

 



-7-   to issue to the holder of such Company Stock Certificate the stock portion
of the Merger Consideration issuable in respect thereto pursuant to Section
1.6(b)(i) (less the shares of Parent Common Stock to be withheld and
deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(ii)), and the Company

deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to
receive the cash and stock amounts payable, if any, in exchange for shares of
Company Capital Stock (without interest) into which such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall have been so converted. No portion of the Merger
Consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock
Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate and validly
executed Exchange Documents pursuant hereto.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent or
Parent shall pay and/or issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Merger Consideration, if any, payable and/or issuable in
respect thereto pursuant to Section 1.6(b) upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, provided that such affidavit contains an
indemnification agreement in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent
with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant
to Section 1.6 and this Section 1.7 to a Person other than the Person whose
name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that
the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will
have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment of any portion of the Total Consideration
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) _Shares of Parent Common Stock_. The certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock issued by Parent to the Stockholders pursuant to Section
1.6(b) and this Section 1.7 shall bear the following legend:

THE SHARES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR ANY STATE
SECURITIES LAWS. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE ABSENCE OF AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SAID ACT AND ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION UNDER
SAID ACT. THE ISSUER OF THESE SHARES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER
OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
LAWS.

(g) _Exchange Agent to Return Merger Consideration_. At any time following
the last day of the sixth month following the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated
successor or assign all cash and stock amounts that have been deposited with
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(i), and any and all interest
thereon or other

 



-8-   income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company Stock
Certificates pursuant to Section 1.7(c), and thereafter the holders of Company
Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the
terms of Section 1.7(i)) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
and all cash and stock amounts that may be payable to such holders of Company
Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.6(b) upon the due surrender of such
Company Stock Certificates and duly executed Exchange Documents in the manner
set forth in Section 1.7(c). No interest shall be payable for the cash and
stock amounts delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this Section
1.7(g) and which are subsequently delivered to the holders of Company Stock
Certificates.

(h) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The cash and stock
amounts paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article I.

(i) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a Stockholder for any amount paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

1.8 _Withholding Taxes_. The Company, the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
provision of federal, local or foreign tax law or under any
Legal Requirements or applicable Orders. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. 

1.9 _Company Loans to Stockholders_. In the event that any Stockholder has
outstanding loans from the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Effective
Time, the consideration payable to such Stockholder pursuant to Section 1.6(b)
hereof shall be reduced by an amount equal to the outstanding principal plus
accrued interest, if any, of such Stockholders loans as of the Effective
Time, plus any other amounts owed by such Stockholder to the Company or any
Subsidiary (collectively, such Stockholders "Loan Repayment Amount"). Such
loans shall be satisfied as to the amount by which the consideration is
reduced pursuant to this Section 1.9. To the extent the consideration payable
to such Stockholder is so reduced, such amount shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to such Stockholder.

1.10 _Taking of Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the officers and directors
of the Company, Parent and Sub are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and reasonably necessary action.

Subject to such exceptions as are specifically set forth in the appropriate
section, subsection or subclause of the disclosure schedule supplied by the
Company to Parent on the date hereof (the "Disclosure Schedule") or in any
other section, subsection or subclause of the Disclosure Schedule solely if
and to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to such other section,
subsection or subclause of this Article II is reasonably apparent on the face
of such disclosure without reference to the documents referenced therein, the

foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of
its assets or properties (whether owned, leased or licensed) or the nature of
its business make such qualification or license necessary to the Companys
business as currently conducted, except where any such failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company has Made Available

Agreement and any Related Agreement to which the Company is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will not
conflict with or result in any violation of or default under (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any
benefit under (any such event, a "Conflict") (a) any provision of the Charter
Documents or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary, as amended, (b)
any Material Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets (whether tangible or

outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to preemptive
rights created by statute, the Charter Documents, or any agreement to which
the Company is a party or by which it is bound.

(b) All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (including Company
Restricted Stock), Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Warrants have
been issued or repurchased (in the case of shares that were outstanding and
repurchased by the Company or any stockholder of the Company) in compliance
with all applicable Legal Requirements, and were issued, transferred and
repurchased (in the case of shares that were outstanding and repurchased by
the Company or any stockholder of the Company) in accordance with any right
of first refusal or similar right or limitation Known to the Company. No
Stockholder has exercised any right of redemption, if any, provided in the 

 



-11-   Certificate of Incorporation with respect to shares of the Company Preferred
Stock, and the Company has not received notice that any Stockholder intends to
exercise such rights. There are no declared or accrued but unpaid dividends

whether the vesting of such Company Restricted Stock is subject to
acceleration as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other events), and whether, to the Knowledge of the Company, the holder
has made a timely election with the Internal Revenue Service under Section
83(b) of the Code with respect to such Company Restricted Stock.

Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, each holder of Company Restricted
Stock has made a timely election with the Internal Revenue Service under
Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to such Company Restricted Stock.

(e) Except for the Plan, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever
adopted, sponsored or maintained any stock option plan or any other plan or
agreement providing for equity-related compensation to any person (whether
payable in shares, cash or otherwise). The Company has reserved 6,185,132
shares of Company Common Stock for issuance to employees and directors of,
and consultants to, the Company upon the issuance of stock or the exercise of
options or restricted stock units granted under the Plan, of which (i)
3,894,570 shares are issuable, as of the date hereof, upon the exercise of
outstanding, unexercised options or restricted stock units granted under the
Plan, (ii) 1,104,792 shares have been issued upon the exercise of options or
purchase of restricted stock granted under the Plan and remain outstanding
as of the date hereof and (iii) 1,185,770 shares remain available for future

the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith, based on a reasonable
valuation method utilized at the time of grant, determined to be at least
equal to the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the date
of grant. The terms of the Plan and the applicable agreements for each Company
Option or Company RSU permit the assumption or substitution of options to
purchase Parent Common Stock or Parent RSUs, as applicable, and the
termination of Company Options and Company RSUs as provided in this Agreement,
without the consent or approval of the holders of such securities, the
Stockholders or otherwise and without any acceleration of the exercise
schedules or vesting provisions in effect for such Company Options or Company
RSUs. True and complete copies of all agreements and instruments relating to
or issued under the Plan have been Made Available and such agreements and
instruments have not been amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no
agreements to amend, modify or supplement such agreements or instruments from
the forms thereof Made Available. No holder of Company Options has the
ability to early exercise any Company Options for shares of Company Restricted
Stock under the Plan or any other Contract relating to such Company Options.

 

(f) Section 2.5(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth for each outstanding
Company Option, Company RSU and Company Warrant, the name of the holder, the
type of entity of such holder, the domicile address of record of such holder,
whether such holder is an employee of the Company, the number of shares of
Company Capital Stock issuable upon the exercise of such option, restricted
stock unit or warrant (as applicable), the date of grant, the exercise price
(if any), the vesting schedule, including the extent vested to date and
whether such vesting is subject to acceleration as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other events, and, for any
option, whether such option is a nonstatutory option or intended to qualify as
an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code.

 



-12-  (g) There are no outstanding loans or Indebtedness involving, on the one hand,
the Company and on the other hand, any of the Stockholders.

(h) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or
any Subsidiary (i) having the right to vote on any matters on which
stockholders may vote (or which is convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having such right) or (ii) the value of which is in any way based
upon or derived from capital or voting stock of the Company, are issued or
outstanding as of the date hereof.

(i) As of the date hereof, an aggregate of 1,542,492 shares of Company Common
Stock are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding Company Warrants and no
shares of Company Preferred Stock are issuable upon the exercise of
outstanding Company Warrants. Except for the Company Options, Company RSUs
and Company Warrants, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights,
convertible securities, commitments or agreements of any character, written or
oral to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the
Company is bound obligating the Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase
or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed,
any shares of the capital stock of the Company or obligating the Company to
grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, otherwise
amend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or
agreement. There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom
stock, profit participation, or other similar rights with respect to the
Company or any Subsidiary (whether payable in shares, cash or otherwise).
Except as contemplated hereby, there are no voting trusts, proxies, or other
agreements or understandings with respect to the voting stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary, and there are no agreements to which the Company
or any Subsidiary is a party relating to the registration, sale or transfer
(including agreements relating to rights of first refusal, co-sale rights or
"drag-along" rights) of any Company Capital Stock. As a result of the Merger,
Parent will be the sole record and beneficial holder of all issued and
outstanding Company Capital Stock and all rights to acquire or receive any
shares of Company Capital Stock, whether or not such shares of Company
Capital Stock are outstanding.

(j) The allocation of the Total Consideration set forth in Article I hereof
is consistent with the certificate of incorporation of the Company as amended
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(k) The Company represents and warrants that Section 2.5(k) of the Disclosure
Schedule is true and correct.

(l) Section 2.5(l) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Companys current
good faith best estimate of the Stockholders that are Unaccredited Investors.

 

2.6 _Company Subsidiaries_.

(a) Section 2.6(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, association, joint venture or other business
entity of which the Company owns or has owned, directly or indirectly, more
than fifty percent (50%) of the stock or other equity interest entitled to
vote on the election of the members of the board of directors or similar
governing body (each, a "Subsidiary"). Each Subsidiary is a corporation,
limited liability company or similar legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or 

 



-13-   organization. Each Subsidiary has the corporate power to own its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted and as
currently contemplated to be conducted, except where any such failure to be
so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power or authority
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the character or location of its assets or properties (whether owned, leased
or licensed) or the nature of its business make such qualifications or
licenses necessary, except where any such failure to be so qualified,
licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. A true,
correct and complete copy of each Subsidiarys charter documents and bylaws,
each as amended to date and in full force and effect on the date hereof, has
been Made Available. All of the outstanding shares of each Subsidiary are
owned of record and beneficially by the Company. All outstanding shares of

is maintained in a manner consistent with standards generally followed with
respect to similar properties, and is structurally sufficient and otherwise
suitable for the conduct of the Companys business, except as would not be

Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as currently
contemplated to be conducted, and (y) in good operating condition, regularly

the regulations promulgated thereunder), and who might otherwise have,
receive or have the right or entitlement to receive, separately or in the
aggregate, "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and regulations promulgated thereunder), pursuant to which each
such Person shall agree, unless the 280G Approval (as defined below) has been
obtained in a manner that satisfies all applicable requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, to waive
any and all right or entitlement to such "parachute payments" and each such

manner satisfactory to Parent), by such number of Stockholders as is required
by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any "parachute payments",
such that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute
payments" under Section 280G of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that (i) a
Stockholder vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite Stockholder approval was
obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the
Stockholder vote (the "280G Approval"), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not
obtained and as a consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be
made or provided, pursuant to the waivers of those payments and/or benefits
which were executed by the affected individuals on the date of this Agreement.

 

5.5 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, upon reasonable request and

restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request, and (c) all Employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that (i) such access does not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of the Company, and (ii) the Company may
withhold or restrict access to any document or information solely if and to
the extent that the disclosure of such information would reasonably be
expected to violate any Contract or any applicable Legal Requirement or result
in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-product privilege. With respect
to any information that the Company is permitted to withhold pursuant to the
immediately preceding proviso, unless such information relates to a
transaction with the Company within the six-month period immediately preceding
May 14, 2012, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain
the required consent of any third party that is necessary to enable the
Company to provide access or disclosure to Parent, (B) with respect to
information that is subject to a legal privilege or work-product privilege,
enter into a joint defense agreement or other arrangement, as appropriate, so
as to enable the Company to disclose such information to Parent in a manner
that does not result in the loss of such privilege, and (C) develop an
alternative means by which to provide Parent with such information in a manner
that does not violate the applicable Contract or Legal Requirement or
jeopardize the applicable privilege. No information or knowledge obtained in
any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.5 or otherwise shall affect or
be deemed to modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty
contained herein or in the Disclosure Schedule or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms and provisions hereof, restrict, impair or otherwise affect any
Indemnified Parties right to indemnification hereunder or otherwise prevent
or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

 



-39-  5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
at or prior to the Effective Time, and (b) any failure of the Company to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not (i) limit or otherwise
affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice, or (ii)
constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement; _and
provided, further_  that the failure to deliver a notice pursuant to this
Section 5.6 shall not be considered in determining whether the condition set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) has been satisfied. No disclosure by
the Company pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify,
amend or supplement any representation or warranty contained herein or in the
Disclosure Schedule or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof,
restrict, impair or otherwise affect any Indemnified Parties right to
indemnification hereunder or otherwise prevent or cure any misrepresentations,
breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

5.7 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that
the information obtained in any investigation pursuant to Section 5.5 or any
information obtained pursuant to the notice requirements of Section 5.6, or
otherwise pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or
the effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of May 3, 2012 (the
"Confidential Disclosure Agreement"), between the Company and Parent. In
this regard, the Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock is
publicly traded and that any information obtained during the course of its due
diligence could be considered to be material non-public information within the
meaning of federal and state securities laws. Accordingly, the Company
acknowledges and agrees not to engage in any discussions, correspondence or
transactions in the Parent Common Stock in violation of applicable securities
laws.

 

5.8 _Contract Notices and Consents_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of
any third parties to any Contract (including all of the Contracts set forth in
Section 2.4 of the Disclosure Schedule) as are required thereunder in
connection with the Merger in order for such Contract to remain in full force
and effect following the Merger. Such consents, modifications, waivers and
approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. In the event the
Merger is not consummated for any reason, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
have any liability to the Company, the Stockholders or any other Person for
any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking
to obtain such consents, modifications, waivers and approvals.

 

5.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) _Vesting Acceleration Waivers_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an executed Vesting Acceleration
Waiver, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Vesting
Acceleration Waiver"), from each person set forth on Schedule 5.9(a).

(b) _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements_. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an executed Non-

-40-  (c) _Termination of Employee Plans_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall take all action necessary to terminate the Plan, such termination to be

Parent, effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans
intended to include group severance pay or benefits and any Code Section
401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless Parent provides written
notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated). The
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that any such Company Employee Plan
has been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors (or
similar body) of the Company or its ERISA Affiliates, as the case may be. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval
of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating any such Company Employee Plan as Parent may require. In the
event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to
trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees, then such
charges and/or fees shall be included in Third Party Expenses and shall be the
responsibility of the Company, and the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and
provide such estimate in the Spreadsheet.

 

(d) _New Employment Arrangements_ _._ Prior to the Closing, Parent shall, or
shall cause one of its subsidiaries to, extend an offer of employment to each
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary in one of Parents customary forms
(an "Offer Letter") to become an employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries
effective on the first Business Day after the Closing. Each such Offer Letter
shall provide each Continuing Employee with overall salary and benefits
(including any equity or equity-based plan, program or arrangement) which, in
the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided to each such
Continuing Employee by the Company or any Subsidiary immediately prior to the
date hereof (excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program or
arrangement); _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated
under the terms of this Agreement to cause the continuation of any employment
relationship with any Continuing Employee for any specific period of time. In
the event that any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary declines to
accept Parents offer of employment made in accordance with this Section
5.9(d), the Company or a Subsidiary (as applicable) shall terminate the
employment of such person effective prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
credit each Continuing Employee for all service with the Company (or any
Subsidiary) prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
any vacation plan or paid time off policy of Parent.

(e) _Employee Retention Program_. Schedule 5.9(e) hereto is incorporated
herein by reference.

(f) _No Employment Commitment or Plan Amendments_. Except for Section 5.14, no
provision of this Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted, to provide
or create any third party beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind
or nature whatsoever in any stockholder, Key Employee, Other Employee,
consultant, contractor or any other Person, including any rights of employment
for any specified period and/or any employee benefits, in favor of any
Person, union, association, continuing employee, Key Employee, Other Employee,
consultant or contractor or any other Person, other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and all provisions
hereof will be personal solely among the parties to this Agreement. In
addition, no provision of this Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted,
to amend any term or condition of the Plan or any other employee related
plan, program or policy of the Company or any Subsidiary.

paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time and all Third Party Expenses
that will not be paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

expenses and costs incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection

submission of its Notification and Report Form filed under the HSR Act in
connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby.

indemnification under Article VII of this Agreement (including as a result of
a waiver by the Indemnified Parties). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent

her capacity as a Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement or any Related
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have no obligation to
maintain the existence of the Surviving Corporation for any specified period
following the Effective Time. The Company hereby represents to Parent that no
claim for indemnification has been made as of the date hereof by any director
or officer of the Company.

all premiums on) an extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the
Companys directors and officers on terms reasonably acceptable to
Parent that shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six
(6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage
and have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured Persons than
the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently
maintained by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any
premiums with respect to such policy have not been paid in full by the Company
prior to the Effective Time, then such payments shall be Third Party Expenses
hereunder. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder;  _provided, however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall have no obligation to pay premiums or any other amounts with
respect to such policy.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 5.14 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 5.14 applies without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 5.14 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.14
and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment for
the benefit of creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that either the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.14.

confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable, the
termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, without the consent
of Parent. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to coordinate generally with

which shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such date). The
representations and warranties of Parent that are qualified by materiality

-48-  ARTICLE VII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or in the Officers
Certificate shall survive until 11:59 p.m. California time on the date that
is one year following the Closing Date (the date of expiration of such one-
year period, the "Expiration Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation with
respect to a representation or warranty, such representation or warranty shall
survive indefinitely; _provided_ , _further_ , the (a) representations and
warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.2 (Authority and
Enforceability), Section 2.5 (Company Capital Structure) other than the
representations and warranties set forth in clauses (c), (f) and (g) of
Section 2.5, and Section 2.24 (Third Party Expenses) (together, the
"Fundamental Representations") shall not expire and shall survive
indefinitely, and (b) the representations and warranties contained in Section
2.10 (Tax Matters) (the "Tax Representations") shall survive until the
expiration of all statutes of limitations applicable to the applicable Taxes
addressed by such representations and warranties (including all periods of
extension), (c) the representations and warranties of the Company contained
in Section 2.13 (Intellectual Property) (the "IP Representations") shall
survive until 11:59 p.m. on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
and (d) the representations and warranties of the Company contained Section
2.20 (Compliance with Legal Requirements) (the "Compliance Representations")
shall survive until 11:59 p.m. on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing
Date (the Fundamental Representations, Tax Representations, IP
Representations and Compliance Representations being collectively referred to
as the "Special Representations"); and _provided_ , _further_ , that all
representations and warranties of the Company shall survive beyond the
Expiration Date or other survival periods specified above with respect to any
inaccuracy therein or breach thereof if a claim is made hereunder in writing
setting forth the specific claim and the basis therefor in reasonable detail
prior to the expiration of the survival period for such representation and
warranty, in which case such representation and warranty shall survive as to
such claim until such claim has been finally resolved. The representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, the
Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the Closing. For the avoidance
of doubt, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing
respective survival periods and termination dates supersede any applicable
statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply to such representations and
warranties.

 

7.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after and by virtue of the Merger, subject to the terms of this
Article VII, the Stockholders agree to severally (based on such Stockholders
Pro Rata Portion), but not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and
its officers, directors, affiliates, employees, agents and representatives,
including the Surviving Corporation (the "Indemnified Parties"), from and
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, Taxes, costs,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys and consultants fees and expenses and including any such
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
against or settling any of the foregoing (hereinafter individually a "Loss"
and collectively "Losses") paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the
Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving Corporation)
(regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any Third Party Claims),
directly or indirectly, resulting from, arising out of, or relating to any of
the following:

 

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in, as of the date hereof or as of the
Effective Time, a representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or the Officers Certificate, without giving effect to any update of
or modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made
on or after the date of this Agreement;

 

(ii) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any inaccuracy in any information, or breach of any representation
or warranty, set forth in the Spreadsheet, including any failure to properly
calculate Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, the Balance Sheet Adjustment
Amount, Third Party Expenses, the Tax Amount or Total Consideration; 

 



-49-  (iii) third party Actions against Parent or any Subsidiary (including the
Company or any Subsidiaries) following the Closing, including the costs of
defending against and settling any such third party Actions, if the facts and
circumstances alleged in such third party Action would give the Indemnified
Parties a right to indemnification under Section 7.2(a)(i) if such facts and
circumstances were factually accurate (subject to the limitations under
Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 in respect of such indemnification);

 

(iv) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any fraud or willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation on
the part of the Company, any Subsidiary, any Stockholder or any Representative
of any of the foregoing in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(v) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any of its covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in
Section 5.6, unless such failure to comply with Section 5.6 was knowing and
intentional);

(vi) any payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with this Agreement, and any other Losses paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained in respect of any Dissenting Shares, including all
attorneys and consultants fees, costs and expenses and including any such
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
against or settling any action or proceeding in respect of Dissenting Shares;
and

(vii) any Taxes of the Company (A) attributable to any taxable period or
portion thereof that ends on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax
Period"), including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Transaction Payroll
Taxes, it being understood that, in the case of Taxes based upon income,
sales, proceeds, profits, receipts, wages, compensation or similar items, the
Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined on the basis of a closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and the amount of any other Taxes of the Company
attributable to such Tax period shall equal the amount of such Tax for the
entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the taxable period up to and including the Closing Date, and
the denominator of which is the total number of days in the taxable period),
(B) any Taxes as a result of the Company being (or ceasing to be) on or prior
to the Closing Date (1) a member of an affiliated or combined group pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law prior to the Closing Date or (2) a transferee or
successor by contract or otherwise, which relate to an event occurring on or
before the Closing Date, (C) as a result of an express or implied obligation
arising on or prior to Closing Date to indemnify or otherwise assume or
succeed to the Taxes of any other Person, or (D) any transfer or other Taxes
arising directly (or indirectly) as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any ancillary agreement, to the extent not reflected in
the case of each of the preceding clauses (A)  (D) in the calculation of the
Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount; _provided_ that the Stockholders shall have
no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Parties against any Losses
resulting solely from Taxes resulting from (x) a Code Section 338 election
with respect to Parents acquisition of the Companys stock pursuant to this
Agreement, (y) any transactions occurring after the Effective Time outside the
ordinary course of business (other than as explicitly contemplated by this
Agreement), or (z) any breach by Parent of Section 5.13 hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Article VII only, once it has been
established that there has been any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or any failure by the Company to perform or comply
with any covenant or agreement, solely for the purpose of determining the
amount of Losses suffered as a result of any such breach, inaccuracy or
failure (separate and apart from establishing that there has been any breach
of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or any failure to perform
or comply with any covenant or agreement by the Company), any

 



-50-  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement given or made by the Company
that is qualified or limited in scope as to materiality, "Company Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications shall be deemed to be made or given
without such qualification for the purpose of determining the amount of such
Losses.

 

(b) The Stockholders (including any officer or director of the Company) shall
not have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of advancement
from the Surviving Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by
an Indemnified Party.

(c) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this Article VII will be treated as adjustments to the Total
Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for
purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Parties from and after the Effective Time for any claims arising under this
Agreement, including claims of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) this Section 7.2(d) shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in
this Agreement shall limit the liability of a Stockholder (and this Article
VII shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of such Stockholder)
in connection with a claim based on fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation committed by or with the actual knowledge of such
Stockholder.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any other
Indemnified Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the
parties thereto.

7.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) _Threshold and Deductible_. Except in the case of fraud, willful
misconduct or intentional misrepresentation and indemnification claims for
breaches of or inaccuracies in the Special Representations, the Indemnified
Parties, as a group, may not recover any Losses pursuant to an
indemnification claim under Section 7.2(a)(i) unless and until the Indemnified
Parties, as a group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least
$1,000,000 in Losses in the aggregate, in which case the Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover all Losses above the first $500,000 of Losses
paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties as a group.
For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3(a)
shall not apply to indemnification claims under clauses (ii)  (vii) of
Section 7.2(a), inclusive.

(b) _Recovery from Escrow Fund_.

(i) Except in the case of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation, and indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies
in the Special Representations or indemnification claims under Section
7.2(a)(iii) that are predicated on assumed breaches of or inaccuracies in the
Special Representations, the Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive source of
recovery for indemnification claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) and Section
7.2(a)(iii) shall be recourse against the cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock held in the Escrow Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set
forth in this Section 7.3(b)(i) shall not apply to any indemnification claim
under clauses (ii)  (vii) of Section 7.2(a), inclusive.

 



-51-  (ii) The Indemnified Parties first source of recovery for indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a) shall be recourse against the cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund, but if the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy any portion of a Loss for which an indemnification
claim has been made under Section 7.2(a)(i) for breaches of or inaccuracies
in the Special Representations or for which an indemnification claim has been
made under clauses (ii)  (vii) of Section 7.2(a), inclusive, the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to recover such portion of such Losses in respect of
such indemnification claims directly from the Stockholders (the portion of any
Loss for which indemnification is not satisfied by the Escrow Fund is
referred to as an "Excess Loss").

(c) Except in the case of fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation, (i) the maximum amount that the Indemnified
Parties may recover for indemnification claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) for
breaches of or inaccuracies in the IP Representations and indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a)(iii) that are predicated on assumed breaches of
or inaccuracies in the IP Representations shall be limited to a dollar amount
equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Total Consideration; and (ii) the
maximum amount that the Indemnified Parties may recover for indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) for breaches of or inaccuracies in the
Compliance Representations and indemnification claims under Section
7.2(a)(iii) that are predicated on assumed breaches of or inaccuracies in the
Compliance Representations shall be limited to $74,500,000 in the aggregate.

(d) Except in the case of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation committed by or with the actual knowledge of such
Stockholder, the liability of each Stockholder for indemnification claims
under Section 7.2(a) shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount
equal to the aggregate portion of the Total Consideration (including such
Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount, Representative
Expense Amount and the BO Earn Out Amount) payable to such Stockholder
pursuant to this Agreement (without regard to any withholding, vesting or
other similar limitation applicable to such payments) (valuing the Parent
Common Stock for this purpose using the Parent Trading Price).

(e) In the case of any indemnification claim under Sections 7.2(a) that is not
limited to the recovery of funds from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
7.3(b), subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7.3(b)  (d), the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to bring indemnification claims
under Section 7.2(a)(i)  (vii) as applicable against any or all of the
Stockholders for the Excess Losses, and each Stockholder shall be liable for
its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Excess Losses in respect of
such indemnification claim; _provided, however_ , that that the foregoing
shall not limit the liability of a Stockholder who has committed fraud,
willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, or has actual knowledge
of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, with respect
to such fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation.

 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Indemnified
Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party to be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder. 

 



-52-  (g) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
this Article VII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss (net of
any costs to recover such insurance payments and any increased premiums
resulting therefrom). 

(h) The Indemnified Parties shall act in good faith and a commercially
reasonable manner to mitigate any Losses they may pay, incur, suffer or
sustain for which indemnification is available hereunder to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall not require any Indemnified Party to seek recovery from any third
party). 

(i) The amount of any Loss arising out of any item included as a liability in
calculating the Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount shall be calculated net of
the amount so included. The amount of any Loss arising out of any reduction in
value of any current asset acquired at the Closing shall be calculated net of
the reported value of such current asset used in calculating the Balance
Sheet Adjustment Amount. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Article VII in respect of any Loss that is taken
into account in the calculation of Total Consideration.

 

(j) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to double recovery for any
adjustments to consideration provided for hereunder or for any indemnifiable
Losses even though such Losses may have resulted from the breach of more than
one of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants in this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not
prevent an Indemnified Party from recovering all Losses to which it is
entitled hereunder arising out of the same set of facts and circumstances
notwithstanding the fact that an indemnification claim for such Losses is
based upon more than one representation, warranty, agreement or covenant.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, under no circumstances will either Party be liable to the other
for any punitive damages, except to the extent such punitive damages are
awarded to a third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim.

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
will the amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification hereunder be calculated or otherwise determined based on a
multiple of any financial metric such as revenue, EBITDA or net income (and
Parent hereby waives for itself and all other Indemnified Parties the right
to calculate or otherwise determine Losses using a multiple of any financial
metric).

(m) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, nothing in this Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall limit the liability of a Stockholder in connection with a claim based on
fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation committed by, or
with the actual knowledge of, such Stockholder.

7.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, if an
Indemnified Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article
VII, such Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an
"Indemnification Claim Notice") to the Stockholder Representative (with a copy
to the Escrow Agent) (or in the event an Indemnified Party elects to pursue
such indemnification claim directly against a Stockholder, to such Stockholder
directly) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered
or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or
sustain Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
of such Losses, the date each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and, if applicable,
the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which
such item is related. Parent may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from
time to time to reflect any new information discovered with respect to the
claim set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice.

 



-53-  (b) If the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholders (or the
Indemnifying Party in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) shall not object in writing
within the 30-day period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by
delivery of a written notice of objection containing a reasonably detailed
description of the facts and circumstances supporting an objection to the
applicable indemnification claim (an "Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice"), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by
the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholders (or the
applicable Indemnifying Party) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the
full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim
Notice. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the Escrow
Fund cash and shares of Parent Common Stock with an aggregate value equal to
the Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice as directed by
the Stockholder Representative, with any shares of Parent Common Stock
released from the Escrow Fund to be valued for this purpose using the Parent
Trading Price.

(c) In the event that the Stockholder Representative (or in the event that
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party,
such Indemnifying Party) shall deliver an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(b) within 30 days after delivery of such
Indemnification Claim Notice, the Stockholder Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.
If the Stockholder Representative (or such objecting Indemnifying Party) and
Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of an indemnification
claim to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.
In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund an
amount of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock with an aggregate value equal
to the Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice as directed by
the Stockholder Representative, with any shares of Parent Common Stock
released from the Escrow Fund to be valued for this purpose using the Parent
Trading Price. Should the amount held in the Escrow Fund, if any, be
insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount owed to an Indemnified Party in
accordance with such memorandum and this Agreement, then each Stockholder
shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the date of such memorandum,
pay to the Indemnified Party such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of such
shortfall in cash.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and
prior to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative (or the objecting
Indemnifying Party) may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of
the Loss that is at issue is the subject of a pending litigation with a third
party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event
the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware pursuant to the arbitration proceedings set out in 10
Del. C. §349 and the Court of Chancery Rules relating thereto, including
Court of Chancery Rules 96, 97, and 98. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how
all expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid. The decision of the
arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Indemnification
Claim Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties to this
Agreement and the Stockholders and any Indemnifying Party, and shall not be
subject to appeal. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration
provision shall apply to any dispute among the Stockholders or any
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties under this Article VII, whether
relating to claims to recover funds from the Escrow Fund or to the other
indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VII.

 



-54-  7.5 _Third Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a
demand against the Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this
Article VII, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative (or, in the
event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnifying Party) of such Third Party Claim, and the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Stockholders (or, in the
event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled), at its expense, to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third
Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct
the defense of, and to settle, any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative
(or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party), no settlement of any such Third
Party Claim shall be determinative of whether an Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification hereunder in respect of such Third Party Claim or the
amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) has consented
to any such settlement, the Stockholders shall have no power or authority to
object under any provision of this Article VII to the amount of any claim by
Parent against the Escrow Fund in respect of such Third Party Claim. In the
event that the Stockholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification is
being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying
Party) does not consent to any such settlement, and the Indemnified
Parties wish to seek indemnification hereunder in respect of such Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Parties shall make such indemnification claims
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 7.4.

 

7.6 _Stockholder Representative_.

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, and the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Stockholders,
each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as
the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholders to give
and receive notices and communications in respect of indemnification
claims under this Agreement to be recovered against the Escrow Fund, to
authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of any indemnification claims hereunder by any Indemnified Party,
to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to any such indemnification claims, to
assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, any such indemnification claim by any Indemnified Party hereunder
against any Stockholder or by any such Stockholder against any Indemnified
Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Stockholder,
in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time to
time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Parent; _provided,
however_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless
holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and
to the identity of the substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event of a resignation of the Stockholder Representative or other vacancy
in the position of Stockholder Representative, such vacancy may be filled by
the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall
be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative shall not receive any compensation for its services other than
pursuant to the terms of that

 



-55-  certain Stockholder Representative Agreement, dated on or about the date
hereof, entered into by and among the Stockholder Representative, the Company
and certain of the Stockholders. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Stockholders.

 

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith
and without gross negligence. The Stockholders on whose behalf the Escrow
Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall indemnify the Stockholder
Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any
and all Losses arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties hereunder, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the
Stockholder Representative and any amounts required to be paid by the
Stockholder Representative to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement ("Stockholder Representative Expenses"), in each case, as such
Stockholder Representative Expense is incurred or suffered; _provided_ , that
in the event that any such Stockholder Representative Expense is finally
adjudicated to have arisen from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Stockholder Representative or any of its members, managers,
agents, employees or affiliates, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse
the Stockholders the amount of such Stockholder Representative Expense
attributable to such bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Representative Expense Amount shall be available to reimburse the
Stockholder Representative for any Stockholder Representative Expenses.
Following the Expiration Date, the resolution of all indemnification claims
made under this Agreement and the satisfaction of all such indemnification
claims, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to recover
Stockholder Representative Expenses not previously recovered from the
Representative Escrow Fund from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to
the Stockholders, and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the Stockholder Representative
Expenses actually incurred and not previously recovered. For the avoidance of
doubt, while this section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid
from the Representative Escrow Fund and Escrow Fund, this Section 7.6(b) shall
not limit the obligation of any Stockholder to promptly pay such
Stockholder Representative Expenses as they are incurred. Following the
Expiration Date, the resolution of all indemnification claims made under this
Agreement and the satisfaction of all such indemnification claims, the
Stockholder Representative shall distribute such portion of the
Representative Expense Amount that has not been used to reimburse the
Stockholder Representative for Stockholder Representative Expenses, if any, to
the Escrow Agent, who will promptly distribute such funds to the Stockholders
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3
or Section 8.4, shall constitute a decision of the Stockholders and shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon the Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and

any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit (i) the amounts of recovery
sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation (ii) the time period during which a claim for
fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation may be brought or

hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the

process, (ii) that such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that venue for the action or proceeding is improper or that this

which any party hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court

documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The

agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as
requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.

each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof (including in the case
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation) to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.
