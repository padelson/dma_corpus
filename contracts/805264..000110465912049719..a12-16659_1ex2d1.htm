 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 18, 2012 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among PPG Industries, Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation (" _Burgundy_ "), Eagle Spinco Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Burgundy (" _Spinco_ "), Georgia Gulf Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (" _Grizzly_ "), and Grizzly Acquisition Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Grizzly (" _Merger Sub_
").

 



 

WHEREAS, Spinco is a newly formed, wholly owned, direct Subsidiary of
Burgundy;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Burgundy and
Spinco entered into the Separation Agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Separation Agreement_ "), pursuant to which (a) Burgundy
and its Subsidiaries will transfer or cause to be transferred to Spinco or one
or more of its Subsidiaries all of the Spinco Assets, (b) Spinco or its
Subsidiaries will transfer or cause to be transferred to Burgundy or one or
more of its Subsidiaries all of the Excluded Assets, and (c) Burgundy or one
or more of its Subsidiaries will assume the Excluded Liabilities, in exchange
for (w) one or more of Spincos Subsidiaries assuming the Spinco Liabilities,
(x) Spinco issuing to Burgundy shares of Spinco Common Stock pursuant to the
Spinco Stock Issuance, (y) Spinco distributing to Burgundy the Special Below
Basis Cash Distribution and (z) Spinco distributing to Burgundy the Special
Above Basis Debt/Cash Distribution, as further described herein and in the
Separation Agreement (the " _Spinco Reorganization_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Separation Agreement, on the Distribution Date, Burgundy will either (i)
distribute all of the shares of Spinco Common Stock to Burgundy stockholders
without consideration on a _pro rata_ basis (the " _One-Step Spin-Off_ "), or
(ii) consummate an offer to exchange (the " _Exchange Offer_ ") shares of
Spinco Common Stock for currently outstanding shares of Burgundy Common Stock
and, in the event that Burgundys stockholders subscribe for less than all of
the Spinco Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, Burgundy will distribute, _pro
rata_ to its stockholders, any unsubscribed Spinco Common Stock on the
Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer
so that Burgundy will be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as
having distributed all of the Spinco Common Stock to its stockholders (the "
_Clean Up Spin-Off_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the disposition by Burgundy of 100% of the Spinco Common Stock,
whether by way of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer (followed by any
Clean-Up Spin-Off) is referred to as the " _Distribution_ ";

 



 

WHEREAS, at the Effective Time, the parties will effect the merger of Merger
Sub with and into Spinco, with Spinco continuing as the surviving corporation,
all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Grizzly (the " _Grizzly Board_ ") (i) has
determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable, fair to, and in
the best interests of, Grizzly and its stockholders and has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and
the issuance of shares of Grizzly Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and
(ii) has recommended the approval by the stockholders of Grizzly of the
issuance of shares of Grizzly Common Stock pursuant to the Merger;

      
 

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has determined that the Merger
and this Agreement are advisable and has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Spinco (the " _Spinco Board_ ") has
determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and has approved
this Agreement and the Separation Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Spinco Reorganization, the Distribution and
the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Burgundy (the " _Burgundy Board_ ") has
approved this Agreement and the Separation Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Spinco Reorganization, the

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Spinco, Merger Sub or any holder
of the capital stock of Burgundy, Spinco, Merger Sub or Grizzly:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Spinco Capital Stock_.

 



 

(i) Each share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with _Section
3.1(a)(ii)_) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive a
number of shares or, subject to _Section 3.3_, fraction of a share of Grizzly
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment in accordance
with _Section 3.1(a)(iv)_ and _Section 3.1(d)_.

 



 

(ii) Each share of Spinco Common Stock held by Spinco as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist and no stock or other consideration shall be issued or delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(iii) Each share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this _Section
3.1_, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Grizzly
Common Stock as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ and any dividends or
distributions and other amounts payable in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_.

 



 

(iv) The Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, split-up,
reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution of Grizzly Common Stock or
Spinco Common Stock, or securities convertible into any such securities,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Grizzly Common Stock or Spinco Common Stock having a record date
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, other than the Spinco Reorganization; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 3.1(a)(iv)_ shall be construed to permit Burgundy, Spinco or Grizzly
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Grizzly Common Stock_. Each share of Grizzly Common Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to and at the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding following the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Exchange Ratio True-Up_. If the condition set forth in Section 4.3(d) of
the Separation Agreement with respect to the Distribution Tax Opinion would be
unable to be satisfied because immediately after the Effective Time the
percentage of outstanding shares of Grizzly Common Stock to be received by
former Spinco shareholders with respect to Qualified Spinco Common Stock would
be less than 50.5% (the " _Threshold Percentage_ ") of all outstanding Grizzly
Common Stock (determined without regard to any adjustment pursuant to this
_Section 3.1(d)_) then the aggregate number of shares of Grizzly Common Stock
into which the shares of Spinco Common Stock are converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)(i)_ shall be increased such that the number of shares of
Grizzly Common Stock to be received by former Spinco shareholders with respect
to Qualified Spinco Common Stock equals the Threshold Percentage. If any such
increase is required solely by reason of any actions taken by Burgundy or its
Affiliates pursuant to the plan (or series of related transactions) which
includes the Distribution (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code),
then the Above Basis Amount shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
product of $27.54 multiplied by the number of additional shares of Grizzly
Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to the true-up set forth in this
_Section 3.1(d)_ solely by reason of any such actions taken by Burgundy or
its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Distribution of Per Share Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Burgundy will appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Grizzly as distribution agent (the "
_Agent_ "). Prior to or at the Effective Time, Grizzly shall deposit with the
Agent, for the benefit of Persons who received shares of Spinco Common Stock
in the Distribution and for distribution in accordance with this _Article
III_, through the Agent, certificates or book-entry authorizations
representing the shares of Grizzly Common Stock (such shares of Grizzly Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions and other amounts payable
in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Distribution Fund_ ") issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ upon conversion of
outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock. The Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Grizzly Common Stock contemplated to be
issued pursuant to _Section 3.1_ from the shares of Grizzly Common Stock held
in the Distribution Fund. If Grizzly deposits such shares into the
Distribution Fund prior to the Effective Time and the Merger is not
consummated, the Agent shall promptly return such shares to Grizzly. The
Distribution Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Distribution Procedures_. At the Effective Time, all issued and
outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive shares of Grizzly Common Stock pursuant to, and in accordance with,
the terms of this Agreement. Immediately thereafter, the Agent shall
distribute the shares of Grizzly Common Stock into which the shares of Spinco
Common Stock that were distributed in the Distribution have been converted
pursuant to the Merger, which shares shall be distributed on the same basis as
the shares of Spinco Common Stock were distributed in the Distribution and to
the Persons who received Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution. Each Person
entitled to receive Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution shall be entitled
to receive in respect of the shares of Spinco Common Stock distributed to

 



      
 

 



 

such Person a certificate or book-entry authorization representing the number
of whole shares of Grizzly Common Stock that such holder has the right to

later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time. The Agent shall
make available the net proceeds thereof, after deducting any required

(a) Burgundy has the corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and to

title and interest in and to, or have adequate licenses or other valid and
enforceable rights to use, all Intellectual Property Rights used or held for
use in connection with the Eagle Business as currently conducted (including in
connection with services provided by the Eagle Entities to third parties) (the

items would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Property Rights listed in Section 6.13(a) of the Burgundy Disclosure Letter

has received any written notice that remains unresolved that any such right is
the subject of any interference, opposition, cancellation, nullity, re-
examination or other proceeding placing in question its validity or scope,
except where the lack of such force and effect and where any such
interference, opposition, cancellation, nullity, re-examination or other
proceeding would not, in any such case, reasonably be expected to have,

been asserted or threatened in writing that remains unresolved that either
challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership or use of any of the Spinco
IP Rights listed in Section 6.13(a) of the Burgundy Disclosure Letter or
challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership or use of any other Spinco
IP Rights that would, in any such case, reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

Intellectual Property Right of any third party that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Spinco. To the Knowledge of Burgundy, there are no infringements or
misappropriations of, or other conflicts with, any Spinco IP Rights that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco. To the Knowledge of Burgundy, none of the Spinco IP
Rights listed on Section 6.13(a) of the Burgundy Disclosure Letter has been
infringed, misappropriated or violated by other Persons where such
infringement, misappropriation or violation has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Spinco.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Section 6.13(e) of the Burgundy Disclosure Letter identifies all material
Spinco IP Rights that have been licensed to a third Person. To the Knowledge

the Eagle Entities is in breach of or default under the terms of any Specified
License where such breach or default has had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Spinco. To the Knowledge of Burgundy, no other party to any Specified License
is in breach of or in default under the terms of any Specified Licenses where
such breach or default has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco. Each
Specified License is a valid and binding obligation of the Eagle Entity that
is a party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except insofar as (i)
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies,
(ii) the failure to be a valid and binding obligation or to be enforceable
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Spinco, (iii) such Specified License has previously
expired in accordance with its terms, or (iv) such Specified License has been
terminated in the ordinary course of business.

such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights

Section 6.17 _Sufficiency of Assets_.

 



 

(a) After giving effect to the Spinco Reorganization and the other
transactions described in or contemplated by the Separation Agreement and
after giving effect to the transfer of all the TCI Interests, the Spinco Group
will have, in all material respects, good and valid title, or,

 



      
 

 



 

in the case of the Leased Real Property, valid leasehold interests in, all of
the Spinco Assets, except (i) where the Conveyance of the Spinco Assets
requires a third-party Consent or Governmental Approval that is not obtained,
in which case the provisions of Section 2.7 of the Separation Agreement will
govern, and (ii) where the failure to have such good and valid title, or valid
leasehold interest, results from any of the Permitted Encumbrances, with
respect to the Owned Real Property, Spinco Leasehold Improvements and Leased
Real Property.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Spinco Assets, assuming any requisite third-
party Consents or Governmental Approvals that are necessary to Convey such

its Subsidiaries has any material obligation to inform or consult with any

Section 7.13 _Intellectual Property Matters_.

 



 

(a) Section 7.13(a) of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list as of the date hereof of (i) all material patented or registered
Intellectual Property Rights (and pending applications therefor) of Grizzly;
(ii) all material unregistered trademarks and service marks, and domain name
registrations of Grizzly; (iii) all computer software that is owned or that is
licensed and used or held for use by Grizzly, except for commercially
available over-the-counter "shrink wrap" software and open source software and
software that is not material to Grizzly; and (iv) any other material licenses
to Grizzly or a Grizzly Subsidiary of Intellectual Property Rights to which
Grizzly or a Subsidiary of Grizzly has access as a result of any in-bound
license. With respect to patents and applications therefor listed in Section
7.13(a)(i) of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter, in addition to the title thereof,
Section 7.13(a)(i) of such letter lists the patent or application number, the
filing and issue dates, and countries in which filed or issued. With respect
to registered trademarks and service marks and pending applications therefor
listed in Section 7.13(a)(ii) of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter, in addition to
the mark, Section 7.13(a)(ii) of such letter lists the registration,
application number, registration filing date, and countries in which
registered or filed.

 



 

(b) Grizzly and the Grizzly Subsidiaries own and possess, free and clear of
all Liens except Permitted Encumbrances, or will prior to the Effective Time
have, all right, title and interest in and to, or have adequate licenses or
other valid and enforceable rights to use, all Intellectual Property Rights
used or held for use in connection with Grizzlys business as currently
conducted (including in connection with services provided by Grizzly and the
Grizzly Subsidiaries to third parties) (the " _Grizzly IP Rights_ "), except
where the failure to own or possess such items would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Grizzly.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) To the Knowledge of Grizzly, all patented or registered Intellectual
Property Rights listed in Section 7.13(a) of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter are
in full force and effect. Neither Grizzly nor any of the Grizzly Subsidiaries
has received any written notice that remains unresolved that any such right is
the subject of any interference, opposition, cancellation, nullity, re-
examination or other proceeding placing in question its validity or scope,
except where the lack of such force and effect and where any such
interference, opposition, cancellation, nullity, re-examination or other
proceeding would not, in any such case, reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Grizzly. To the
Knowledge of Spinco, no Grizzly IP Rights consisting of trade secrets or other
proprietary information have been improperly divulged or improperly
appropriated either for the benefit of any Person other than Grizzly or a
Grizzly Subsidiary or to the detriment of Grizzly or any Grizzly Subsidiary
except where such disclosure or appropriation would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Grizzly. No claim or allegation has been asserted or threatened in writing
that remains unresolved that either challenges the validity, enforceability,
ownership or use of any of the Grizzly IP Rights listed in Section 7.13(a) of
the Burgundy Disclosure Letter or challenges the validity, enforceability,
ownership or use of any other Grizzly IP Rights that would, in any such case,
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Grizzly.

 



 

(d) The conduct of Grizzlys business as currently conducted does not
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise conflict with any valid, enforceable
Intellectual Property Right of any third party that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Grizzly. To the Knowledge of Grizzly, there are no infringements or
misappropriations of, or other conflicts with, any Grizzly IP Rights that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Grizzly. To the Knowledge of Grizzly none of the
Grizzly IP Rights listed on Section 7.13(a) of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter
have been infringed, misappropriated or violated by other Persons where such
infringement, misappropriation or violation has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Grizzly.

 



 

(e) Section 7.13(e) of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter identifies all material
Grizzly IP that has been licensed to a third person. To the Knowledge of
Grizzly, none of the counterparties to any license to the Grizzly IP Rights
referenced in the preceding sentence is in breach of or in default under the
terms of the same where such breach or default has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Grizzly.

 



 

(f) Section 7.13(f) of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
licenses of Intellectual Property Rights in effect as of the date hereof
pursuant to which Grizzly or any Grizzly Subsidiary either paid a one-time,
lump-sum license fee in the past six (6) months or is scheduled to make annual
aggregate royalty payments of $500,000 or more are referred to herein as "
_Grizzly Material IP Licenses_." To the Knowledge of Grizzly, none of Grizzly
and the Grizzly Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under the terms of any
Grizzly Material IP License where such breach or default has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Grizzly. To the Knowledge of Grizzly, no other party to any
Grizzly Material IP License is in breach of or in default under the terms of
any Grizzly Material IP Licenses where such breach or default has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Grizzly. Each Grizzly Material IP

 



      
 

 



 

License is a valid and binding obligation of Grizzly or a Grizzly Subsidiary,
and is in full force and effect, except insofar as (i) such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, or by principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies, (ii) the failure to be a valid and
binding obligation or to be enforceable would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Grizzly,
(iii) such Grizzly Material IP License has previously expired in accordance
with its terms, or (iv) such Grizzly Material IP License has been terminated
in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

Section 7.14 _Material Contracts_.

 



 

(a) Section 7.14 of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all
Grizzly Material Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Grizzly Material Contracts_ " means

whether entered into prior to or after the date hereof, to which Grizzly or

(iv) any Contract for the sale or acquisition (including by way of merger,
purchase of equity or other business combination) of any operating business

material obligations; and

 



 

(v) any Contract that provides for annual payments in excess of $10 million by
or to Grizzly or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Neither Grizzly nor any Grizzly Subsidiary is in material breach of or
material default under the terms of any Grizzly Material Contract. To the
Knowledge of Grizzly, no other party to any Grizzly Material Contract is in
material breach of or in material default under the terms of any Grizzly
Material Contract. Each Grizzly Material Contract is a valid and binding
obligation of Grizzly or any Grizzly Subsidiary which is a party thereto and
is in full force and effect, except insofar as (i) such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, or by principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies, (ii) the failure to be a valid and
binding obligation or to be enforceable would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Grizzly,
(iii) the Grizzly Material Contract has previously

 



      
 

 



 

expired in accordance with its terms, or (iv) the Grizzly Material Contract
has been terminated by Grizzly or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business.

(i) except for Permitted Encumbrances, neither Grizzly nor any of the Grizzly
Subsidiaries has leased or otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or
occupy such Grizzly Owned Real Property or any material portion thereof; and
(ii) other than the right of Grizzly pursuant to this Agreement, there are no
outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal to

interest therein.

 



 

(b) Section 7.15(b) of the Grizzly Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date
hereof the address of all Grizzly Leased Real Property, and a true and
complete list, in all material respects, as of the date hereof, of all Grizzly
Leases for such properties for each such Grizzly Leased Real Property, in any
such case, where annual payments under the applicable Grizzly Lease exceed
$500,000 per year. Grizzly has made available to Burgundy a true and complete
copy of each such Grizzly Lease document as of the date hereof, and in the
case of any such Lease that is an oral Lease, a written summary of the
material terms of such Lease. Except as set forth on Section 7.15(b) of the
Grizzly Disclosure Letter, to Grizzlys Knowledge, there are no material
disputes with respect to such Grizzly Lease. With respect to each such Lease,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Grizzly Subsidiaries has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted any Person
the right to use or occupy such Grizzly Leased Real Property or any material
portion thereof; (ii) none of Grizzly or the Grizzly Subsidiaries has

Section 8.3 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Certain Tax Efforts_. Prior to the Effective Time, and from time to time,

to (i) cause the Contribution and Distribution, taken together, to qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of

 



      
 

 



 

Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code; (ii) cause the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and (iii)
facilitate the issuance of the Private Letter Ruling (including the IRS D
Reorganization Ruling and the IRS Debt Exchange Ruling), including by (x) in
the case of Burgundy, modifying or terminating the Burgundy Commitment Letter
and (y) in the case of Grizzly, consenting to such changes to the Burgundy
Commitment Letter, in each case as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate
to facilitate the issuance of the IRS Debt Exchange Ruling. In the event that,
as a result of any modification or termination effected as a result of this
_Section 8.3_, the Burgundy Commitment Letter no longer provides for the
exchange of Spinco Exchange Debt in full satisfaction of the Burgundy Debt
(the " _Trigger Event_ "), Grizzly shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain a bridge facility from the lenders under the Burgundy
Financing for the purpose of financing the Special Above Basis Debt/Cash
Distribution as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of the
Trigger Event, including using reasonable best efforts to enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) _IRS Ruling_.

 



 

(i) Burgundy has submitted to the IRS a request (the " _Ruling Request_ ") for
the IRS D Reorganization Ruling, the IRS Debt Exchange Ruling and certain
related rulings. Burgundy in consultation with Grizzly, shall prepare and
submit to the IRS supplemental materials relating thereto that Burgundy
determines are necessary or appropriate to obtain the requested rulings from
the IRS (each, an " _IRS Submission_ "). As soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, Burgundy shall submit one or more such IRS
Submissions that include, but need not be limited to, the modifications
described in Schedule 8.3(b)(i) of this Agreement (the " _Specified
Submissions_ "). Burgundy shall provide Grizzly with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on each material IRS Submission prior to the filing of
such IRS Submission with the IRS and Burgundy shall, in good faith, consider
any comments provided by Grizzly on each such material IRS Submission;
_provided_ that Burgundy may redact from any IRS Submission any information ("
_Redactable Information_ ") that (x) Burgundy, in its good faith judgment,
considers to be confidential and not germane to Grizzlys or Spincos
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements,
and (y) is not a part of any other publicly available information, including
any non-confidential filing. No IRS Submission (including, without limitation,
the Specified Submissions) shall be filed with the IRS unless, prior to such
filing, Grizzly shall have agreed (which agreement will not be withheld
unreasonably, conditioned or delayed) as to the contents of such IRS
Submission, to the extent that such contents include statements or
representations that Grizzly reasonably and in good faith determines will have
a material effect on Grizzly or any of its Affiliates (including Spinco or the
Spinco Subsidiaries for periods after the Effective Time) (it being agreed and
understood that Grizzly has consented to the statements and representations in
the Ruling Request). Burgundy shall provide Grizzly with copies of each IRS
Submission as filed with the IRS promptly following the filing thereof,
provided that Burgundy may redact any Redactable Information from the IRS
Submission.

 



 

(ii) Subject to Schedule 8.3(b)(ii), Burgundy shall use its reasonable best
efforts to notify Grizzly and Grizzlys representatives of any substantive
communications with the IRS regarding any material issue arising with respect
to the Ruling Request, in cluding, without limitation, the Specified
Submission, and to give Grizzly (or Grizzlys

 



      
 

 



 

representatives) a reasonable opportunity to participate in any meetings or
conferences with IRS personnel regarding such material issue, whether
telephonically, in person or otherwise. Solely for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ shall provide grounds for Spinco or
Grizzly to alter any obligation or limitation imposed upon it under this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Distribution Tax Opinion_. Each of Burgundy, Spinco and Grizzly agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Distribution Tax Opinion. The
Distribution Tax Opinion shall be based upon the Ruling Request, the IRS
Submissions and the Private Letter Ruling (including the IRS D Reorganization
Ruling and the IRS Debt Exchange Ruling) and customary representations and
covenants, including those contained in certificates of Burgundy, Spinco,
Grizzly and others, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Burgundy
Tax Counsel (such representations and covenants, the " _Distribution Tax
Representations_ "). Each of Burgundy, Spinco and Grizzly shall deliver to
Burgundy Tax Counsel for purposes of the Distribution Tax Opinion customary
Distribution Tax Representations, reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Burgundy Tax Counsel.

 



 

(d) _Merger Tax Opinions_. Burgundy and Spinco, on the one hand, and Grizzly,
on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other in obtaining, and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, a written opinion of
Burgundy Tax Counsel, in the case of Burgundy and Spinco, and Jones Day, in
the case of Grizzly (" _Grizzly Tax Counsel_ "), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Burgundy and Grizzly, respectively (each such
opinion, a " _Merger Tax Opinion_ "), dated as of the Effective Time, to the
effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth
in such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Grizzly, Burgundy and Spinco
shall deliver to Grizzly Tax Counsel and Burgundy Tax Counsel for purposes of
the Merger Tax Opinions customary representations and covenants, including
those contained in certificates of Grizzly, Burgundy, Spinco and others,
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Grizzly Tax Counsel and
Burgundy Tax Counsel.

 



 

(e) _Canadian Tax Matters_.

 



 

(i) Each of Burgundy and Grizzly, together with Burgundy Tax Counsel, Grizzly
Tax Counsel, and their other respective advisors as determined by each, shall
consult with each other in good faith, and shall consult together with and
seek a ruling (the " _CRA Ruling Request_ ") from the Canadian Revenue Agency
(" _CRA_ ") substantially to the effect that the "Canadian Butterfly"
transactions described in the Ruling Request (the " _Canadian Butterfly
Transaction_ ") will qualify as a tax-free transaction for Canadian income tax
purposes under the potential transaction structures contemplated by Burgundy
and Grizzly and in accordance with Schedule 8.3(e).

 



 

(ii) Burgundy shall (A) notify Grizzly and Grizzlys representatives of any
substantive communications with the CRA regarding the effect of the Merger on
the intended tax-free treatment of the Canadian Butterfly Transaction for
Canadian income tax purposes, give Grizzly (or Grizzlys representatives) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in any scheduled meetings or conferences
with CRA personnel regarding the effect of the Merger on the intended tax-free
treatment of the Canadian Butterfly Transaction,

 



      
 

 



 

whether telephonically, in person or otherwise, and use reasonable best
efforts to schedule or re-schedule any meetings or conferences with the CRA
personnel regarding the effect of the Merger on the intended tax-free
treatment of the Canadian Butterfly Transaction; and (B) use its reasonable
best efforts to notify Grizzly and Grizzlys representatives of any
substantive communications with the CRA regarding any material issue arising
with respect to the CRA Ruling Request and to give Grizzly (or Grizzlys
representatives) a reasonable opportunity to participate in any meetings or
conferences with CRA personnel regarding such material issue, whether
telephonically, in person or otherwise. Solely for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 8.3(e)(ii)_ shall provide grounds for Spinco or
Grizzly to alter any obligation or limitation imposed upon it under this
Agreement.

Burgundy and Spinco shall prepare, and Grizzly shall file with the SEC, the

promptly inform the other party of any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any
other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby (and in each case, if
any such communication is in writing, share a copy with the other party) and
(iii) permit the other party to review in advance any communication to be
given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
material telephone call with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other
applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 



 

(b) Without limiting this _Section 8.7_, but subject to the next sentence of
this _Section 8.7(b)_, each of the parties agrees to take, or to cause to be
taken, any and all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger
control, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including proposing, negotiating,
committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Spinco (or the Spinco Subsidiaries) or Grizzly (or the Grizzly
Subsidiaries), as applicable, or otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that limit Spincos or the Spinco Subsidiaries or Grizzlys or the
Grizzly Subsidiaries, as applicable, freedom of action with respect to, or
their ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Spinco (or the Spinco Subsidiaries) or Grizzly (or the Grizzly Subsidiaries),
in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other
order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the Closing; provided that the effectiveness of any such sale,
divestiture, license or disposition or action or commitment shall be
contingent on consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of this _Section 8.7(b)_ (i) shall not apply to each of the
parties if compliance with this _Section 8.7(b)_ would result in, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Eagle
Business and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, shall not require Burgundy to
agree to any sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets or
businesses, or restriction or change in the ownership, conduct or operations
of any assets or businesses, that are not included in the Eagle Business.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Accounting Matters_.

 



 

(a) In connection with the information regarding the Eagle Business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement provided by Spinco specifically
for inclusion in, or incorporation by reference into, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement and the Spinco Registration
Statement, to the extent that such letters are customarily delivered, Burgundy
shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Grizzly two
letters of Deloitte and Touche LLP, one dated the date on which each of the
Registration Statement and the Spinco Registration Statement shall become
effective and the other dated the Closing Date, and addressed to Grizzly and
Merger Sub, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Grizzly and
customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement and the Spinco Registration Statement.

 



 

(b) In connection with the information regarding Grizzly or its Subsidiaries
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement provided by Grizzly
specifically for inclusion in, or incorporation by reference into, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement and the Spinco Registration
Statement, to the extent that such letters are customarily delivered, Grizzly
shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Spinco two
letters of each of Deloitte and Touche LLP and Ernst and Young LLP, one dated the
date on which each of the Registration Statement and the Spinco Registration
Statement shall become effective and the

 



      
 

 



 

other dated the Closing Date, and addressed to Burgundy and Spinco, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Burgundy and customary in scope and
substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement
and the Spinco Registration Statement.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, (i) each of the
Eagle Entities and Spinco, on the one hand, and (ii) Grizzly, on the other
hand, shall, subject to applicable Law, afford to the other and to its
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other authorized
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout
the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date,
to its and its Subsidiaries officers, employees, accountants, consultants,
representatives, plants, properties, Contracts, commitments, books, records
(including Tax Returns) and any report, schedule or other document filed or
received by it pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities
laws, and shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause its respective
representatives to furnish promptly to the other such additional financial and
operating data and other information, including environmental information, as
to its and its Subsidiaries respective businesses and properties as the
others or their respective duly authorized representatives, as the case may
be, may reasonably request; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall
require any Person to permit any inspection or disclose any information to
another Person that would cause a violation of any Contract, would cause a
risk of a loss of privilege to the first Person, that is competitively
sensitive information or to permit another Person to perform any onsite
procedure with respect to any of the first Persons or its Subsidiaries
properties ( _provided_ that the Person that would otherwise be required to
disclose information to the other shall take any and all reasonable action
necessary to permit such disclosure without such loss of privilege or
violation of agreement or Law). Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties shall be obligated to grant any
access or make any disclosure in violation of applicable Laws or regulations,
or if it would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of such partys
business or result in damage to property (other than immaterial damage),
without that partys written consent (which that party may grant or deny at
its sole discretion), or grant any access to, or make any disclosure of, any
customer Contracts. The parties hereby agree that the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and material
furnished by any party or its representatives thereunder and hereunder. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Grizzly will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Grizzlys and its Subsidiaries respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries, the " _Representatives_ ") not to, (i) initiate or solicit, or
knowingly facilitate, assist or encourage, directly or indirectly, any
inquiries with respect to, or the encouragement or making of, any Grizzly
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) except as permitted below in _Section 8.10(b)_,
engage in negotiations or discussions with, furnish access to its properties,
books and records or provide any information or data to, or cooperate with,
any Person relating to a Grizzly Acquisition Proposal, (iii) except as
permitted below in _Section 8.10(d)_, approve, endorse or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Grizzly Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger

 



      
 

 



 

agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with _Section 8.10(b)_), (v) waive, terminate,
modify or fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" obligation of any
Person other than Burgundy, (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any
"fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including
any transaction under, or a third party becoming an "interested shareholder"
under, Section 203 of the DGCL) inapplicable to any transactions contemplated
by a Grizzly Acquisition Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder,
Grizzly shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that
may have been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Burgundy or any of
Burgundys Affiliates, under any such provisions), or (vii) resolve, propose
or agree to do any of the foregoing. Grizzly shall immediately cease any
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person that has made or
indicated an intention to make a Grizzly Acquisition Proposal (except
Burgundy, Spinco and their respective Representatives). It is understood that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 8.10(a)_ by any
of the Grizzly Subsidiaries or any of Grizzlys or the Grizzly Subsidiaries
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 8.10(a)_ by
Grizzly.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Grizzly Stockholder Approval, in the event that Grizzly
receives a _bona fide_ written Grizzly Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of _Section 8.10(a)_, Grizzly and the Grizzly Board may
participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof,
making any counterproposal) with, or furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, any information to ( _provided_ that all such
information has previously been provided or made available to Burgundy or is
provided or made available to Burgundy substantially concurrently with the
time it is so furnished), any Person making such Grizzly Acquisition Proposal
and its Representatives or potential sources of financing if the Grizzly Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor, that such Grizzly Acquisition Proposal could reasonably
lead to the receipt of a Grizzly Superior Proposal. In addition, nothing
herein shall restrict Grizzly from complying with its disclosure obligations
with regard to any Grizzly Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any action that would constitute a Change in
Recommendation may only be made in compliance with _Section 8.10(d)_. For
purposes of this Agreement, a " _Grizzly Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona
fide_ written offer made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly,
by merger, consolidation or other business combination or other similar
acquisition transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, at least a majority of the shares of the Grizzly Common Stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all of the assets of Grizzly and the
Grizzly Subsidiaries, with respect to which the Grizzly Board (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor) has
determined in its good faith judgment that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by such written offer (x) would be more favorable to
Grizzlys stockholders than the Merger, after taking into account all the
terms and conditions of such proposal (including the financial aspects of such
proposal, the form of consideration, the likelihood, ability to finance,
conditionality and timing of consummation of such proposal, any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and any other aspects of the transaction
described in such proposal, including the identity of the Person or "group"
(as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making such
proposal) and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Burgundy to Grizzly in response to such
proposal or otherwise), and (y) would be reasonably likely to be completed on
the terms proposed on a timely basis,

 



      
 

 



 

taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal; and an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any
customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less
restrictive to such Person, and no less favorable to Grizzly, than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(c) Grizzly will promptly (and in any event within one Business Day after
receipt) notify Burgundy of the receipt by Grizzly of any Grizzly Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall include the identity of the Person(s) making such
Grizzly Acquisition Proposal and copies of any written materials evidencing
such Grizzly Acquisition Proposal. Grizzly will keep Burgundy reasonably
informed of the status and material terms and conditions of any such Grizzly
Acquisition Proposal. Without limitation of the foregoing, Grizzly will
promptly provide to Burgundy (and in any event within one Business Day) any
material modifications to the terms of any Grizzly Acquisition Proposal
(including promptly furnishing copies of any written materials evidencing such
material modifications) and will promptly notify Burgundy of any determination
by the Grizzly Board that a Grizzly Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Grizzly
Superior Proposal. Grizzly shall not, and shall cause Grizzlys Subsidiaries
not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, and neither Grizzly nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any
Contract, in each case, that prohibits Grizzly from complying with its
obligations under this _Section 8.10_.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 8.10(d)_, Grizzly and the
Grizzly Board shall not (i) fail to include the Grizzly Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (ii) withhold, withdraw, amend, change, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Burgundy, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend, change, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Burgundy,
the Grizzly Recommendation, (iii) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend to the
stockholders of Grizzly any Grizzly Acquisition Proposal, or publicly propose
to approve, adopt or recommend to the stockholders of Grizzly any Grizzly
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, or
agreement in principle requiring Grizzly to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations
hereunder (any of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above being referred to as a "
_Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grizzly
Board, at any time prior to obtaining the Grizzly Stockholder Approval,
subject to _Section 8.10(e)_, may effect a Change in Recommendation
contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition thereof, if the
Grizzly Board has received a _bona fide_ written Grizzly Acquisition Proposal
that it determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor) constitutes a Grizzly Superior Proposal, and
the Grizzly Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Grizzly and the Grizzly Board may not make a Change in Recommendation
otherwise permitted by _Section 8.10(d)_ unless (i) it notifies Burgundy in
writing of its intention to take such action at least five (5) Business Days
prior to taking such action, identifying the Person(s) making such Grizzly
Superior Proposal and providing copies of any written materials evidencing
such Grizzly Superior Proposal, (ii) if requested by Burgundy, Grizzly and its
Representatives shall have made themselves available to discuss with Burgundy
and its Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and shall have negotiated in good faith with

 



      
 

 



 

Burgundy during such notice period to enable Burgundy to propose changes to
the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Grizzly Superior Proposal
to no longer constitute a Grizzly Superior Proposal, (iii) the Grizzly Board
shall have considered in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor) any changes to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Burgundy and determined that the Grizzly Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Grizzly Superior Proposal if such changes were to be
given effect, and (iv) in the event of any change to any of the financial
terms (including the form or amount of consideration) or any material terms of
such Grizzly Superior Proposal, Grizzly shall, in each case, have delivered to
Burgundy an additional notice and copies of the relevant proposed transaction
agreement and other material documents and a new three (3) Business Day notice
period shall commence upon such delivery, during which time subsections (ii),
(iii) and (iv) above shall apply; _provided_ , that if any Grizzly Superior
Proposal is received less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Grizzly
Stockholders Meeting, or changes to the terms of a Grizzly Superior Proposal
are proposed less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Grizzly
Stockholders Meeting, then the, as applicable, five (5) Business Day or three
(3) Business Day period contemplated above shall be shortened such that it
will expire as of the close of business on the day preceding the Grizzly
Stockholders Meeting, unless the Grizzly Stockholders Meeting is postponed.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 8.10_ shall prohibit Grizzly from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Grizzly Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with applicable Law, it being understood, however, that
nothing in this _Section 8.10(f)_ shall be deemed to permit the Grizzly Board
to make a Change in Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section
8.10(d)_.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Grizzly shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Spinco Commitment Letter and
the Spinco Related Letter without the prior written consent of Burgundy (and,
to the extent _Section 8.3_ is applicable, such consent is subject to
Burgundys obligations in _Section 8.3_), if such amendments, modifications
or waivers would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Spinco Financing below the Below Basis Amount, (ii) impose new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Spinco Financing that would
reasonably be expected to (A) expand in any material respect the conditions
precedent or contingencies to the funding at Closing, (B) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, or (C) materially adversely
impact the ability of Grizzly to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Spinco Commitment Letter ( _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt,
Grizzly may, without the consent of Burgundy, replace or amend the Spinco
Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, if the
addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the
availability of financing under the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Spinco
Related Letter, obtaining from the IRS the Private Letter Ruling (including
the IRS D Reorganization Ruling and the IRS Debt Exchange Ruling) or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements) or (iii) prevent or materially delay obtaining from
the IRS

 



      
 

 



 

the Private Letter Ruling (including the IRS D Reorganization Ruling and the
IRS Debt Exchange Ruling). Grizzly and Merger Sub shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Spinco Financing on the terms and conditions described in or
contemplated by the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts to (1) maintain in effect the Spinco
Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter, (2) satisfy on a timely basis
(taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) all
conditions and covenants applicable to Grizzly in the Spinco Commitment Letter
and the Spinco Related Letter and otherwise comply with its obligations
thereunder, (3) enter into definitive agreements substantially concurrently
with the Closing with respect thereto (the " _Spinco Debt Financing
Agreements_ ") on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Spinco
Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter (or terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) no less favorable to Grizzly and Spinco (in
the reasonable discretion of Grizzly) than the terms and conditions in the
Spinco Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter), (4) in the event that
all conditions in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter
have been satisfied, consummate the Spinco Financing at or prior to Closing,
(5) enforce its rights under the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Spinco
Related Letter and (6) in the event that all conditions in the Spinco
Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter have been satisfied, cause the
lenders providing the Spinco Financing to fund the Spinco Financing. Grizzly
shall (x) furnish to Burgundy complete, correct and executed copies of the
Spinco Debt Financing Agreements, (y) give Burgundy prompt notice of any
material breach by any party of the Spinco Commitment Letter or the Spinco
Related Letter or the Spinco Debt Financing Agreements of which Grizzly
becomes aware or any termination thereof and (z) upon Burgundys request,
otherwise keep Burgundy reasonably informed of the status of Grizzlys efforts
to arrange the Spinco Financing (or any replacement thereof) and the other
financing transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any replacement
thereof). If any portion of the Spinco Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the
Spinco Related Letter (including the flex provisions) from sources
contemplated in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter,
Grizzly and Spinco shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative debt financing from alternative debt sources for the same
purposes as the purposes of the Spinco Financing in an amount not less than
the Below Basis Amount upon terms and conditions not less favorable, taken as
a whole, to Grizzly and Spinco (in the reasonable discretion of Grizzly) than
those in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Spinco Related Letter as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, including
using reasonable best efforts to enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto. Further, Grizzly may, with the prior written consent of Burgundy
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), if
it so determines in its discretion, arrange for alternative financing for the
Spinco Financing from a third party or parties (and, in such instance,
references herein to the "Spinco Commitment Letter" shall mean and include the
written commitment of such third party or parties in respect thereof), if such
alternative financing does not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Spinco
Financing below the Below Basis Amount, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of the Spinco Financing that would reasonably be
expected to (A) expand in any material respect the conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding at Closing, (B) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, or (C) materially adversely impact the ability of
Grizzly to enforce its rights against the other parties thereto, or

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) prevent or materially delay obtaining from the IRS the Private Letter
Ruling (including the IRS D Reorganization Ruling and the IRS Debt Exchange
Ruling). As used herein, references to the "Spinco Financing" shall mean and
include, if applicable, alternative financing arranged in accordance with the
preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Spinco and
Grizzly shall not and shall not permit their respective Affiliates to repay
all or any part of the Spinco Financing, other than in accordance with
Schedule 8.11(a).

 



 

(b) Burgundy shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Burgundy Commitment Letter
or the Burgundy Related Letter without the prior written consent of Grizzly
(and, to the extent _Section 8.3_ is applicable, such consent is subject to
Grizzlys obligations in _Section 8.3_), if such amendments, modifications or
waivers would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Burgundy Financing below the Above Basis Amount, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of the Burgundy Financing that would reasonably be
expected to (A) expand in any material respect the conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding at Closing, (B) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, (C) materially adversely impact the ability of
Burgundy to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Burgundy
Commitment Letter and Burgundy Related Letter or (D) affect in any manner the
terms of the Spinco Exchange Debt. Burgundy, Spinco and Grizzly shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Burgundy Financing on the terms and
conditions described in or contemplated by the Burgundy Commitment Letter and
Burgundy Related Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (1)
maintain in effect the Burgundy Commitment Letter and the Burgundy Related
Letter, (2) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period) all conditions and covenants applicable to Burgundy,
Spinco and Grizzly in the Burgundy Commitment Letter and Burgundy Related
Letter and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (3) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto (the " _Burgundy Debt Financing
Agreements_ ") on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Burgundy
Commitment Letter and Burgundy Related Letter (or terms and conditions no less
favorable to Burgundy, Spinco and Grizzly (in the reasonable discretion of
Burgundy and Grizzly, respectively) than the terms and conditions in the
Burgundy Commitment Letter and Burgundy Related Letter), (4) in the case of
Burgundy, enforce its rights under the Burgundy Commitment Letter, and (5) in
the event that all conditions in the Burgundy Commitment Letter and the
definitive documentation with respect thereto have been satisfied, cause the
lenders providing the Burgundy Financing to fund the Burgundy Debt and, on the
Closing Date, accept Spinco Exchange Debt in full satisfaction thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Burgundy shall have the primary
responsibility, which will be exercised in consultation with Grizzly, with
respect to the negotiation of the definitive documentation with respect to the
Burgundy Debt in accordance with the Burgundy Commitment Letter and (ii)
Grizzly shall have the sole responsibility and sole discretion with respect to
the negotiation of the definitive documentation with respect to the Spinco
Exchange Debt in accordance with the Burgundy Commitment Letter (it being
understood that the Spinco Exchange Debt may have an interest rate up to the
Total Cap if required by the lenders under the Burgundy Commitment Letter).
Grizzly and Burgundy shall (x) furnish to the other complete, correct and
executed copies of the applicable Burgundy Debt Financing Agreements
negotiated by them, (y) give the other prompt notice of any material breach by
any party of the Burgundy Commitment Letter or the Burgundy Related Letter or
any of the Burgundy Debt Financing

 



      
 

 



 

Agreements of which either shall become aware or any termination thereof and
(z) upon request, otherwise keep the other reasonably informed of the status
of their respective efforts to arrange the Burgundy Financing (or any
replacement thereof), including both the Burgundy Debt and the Spinco Exchange
Debt. If any portion of the Burgundy Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Burgundy Commitment Letter or
Burgundy Related Letter (including the flex provisions) or from sources
contemplated in the Burgundy Commitment Letter, Grizzly and Burgundy shall use
their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing
from alternative debt sources for the same purposes as the purposes of the
Burgundy Financing in an amount not less than the Above Basis Amount upon
terms and conditions not less favorable, taken as a whole, to Grizzly and
Burgundy (each in their respective reasonable discretion) than those in the
Burgundy Commitment Letter and Burgundy Related Letter as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, including using reasonable
best efforts to enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the
first period of twenty (20) consecutive Business Days (or fifteen (15)
consecutive Business Days if commenced on or after January 2, 2013) throughout
which (I) Grizzly shall have previously received from Spinco all of the
Required Financial Information and during which period such information shall
remain compliant in all material respects at all times with the applicable
provisions of Regulation S-X and S-K under the Securities Act and (II) the
conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ shall be satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing Date) and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would
cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing Date and
other than the condition in _Section 9.2(f)_) to fail to be satisfied,
assuming that the Closing Date were to be scheduled for any time during such
twenty (20) consecutive Business Day period; provided that (i) for purposes of
determining the Marketing Period, November 23, 2012 shall be deemed not to be
a Business Day and (ii) the entirety of such Marketing Period must occur prior
to December 19, 2012, or after January 2, 2013; provided that in the case of
this clause (ii) the Marketing Period must be complete prior to February 14,
2013 or otherwise not commence until the audited financial statements of both
Grizzly and Spinco for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 are available;
provided, further, that the Marketing Period will not be deemed to have
commenced if prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, (x) Spincos
auditors shall have withdrawn their audit opinion contained in the Required
Financial Information in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed
to commence unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with
respect thereto by Spincos auditors or another independent public accounting
firm reasonably acceptable to Grizzly, (y) the financial statements included
in the Required Financial Information that is available to Grizzly on the
first day of the Marketing Period would not be sufficiently current on any day
during such period to satisfy the requirements of Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X
to permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be
declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such period, or not
sufficient for the underwriters or initial purchasers to receive a customary
comfort letter, including customary "negative assurance" comfort, in which
case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until the receipt by
Grizzly of updated Required Financial Information that would be required under
Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement using such
financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of
such new twenty (20) consecutive Business Day period, or (z) Burgundy or
Spinco issues a public statement indicating its intent to restate any
historical financial statements of Spinco or that any such

 



      
 

 



 

restatement is under consideration or may be a possibility, in which case the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence unless and until such
restatement has been completed and the relevant SEC Report or SEC Reports have
been amended or Burgundy has announced that it has concluded that no
restatement shall be required in accordance with GAAP; provided, further, that
the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which
the Spinco Financing is funded.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, each of Burgundy and Spinco shall and shall cause
its Subsidiaries (including Spinco in the case of Burgundy) to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its respective Representatives to,
provide to Grizzly all cooperation reasonably requested by Grizzly that is
necessary in connection with the Spinco Financing and the Spinco Exchange
Debt, and any other financing by Grizzly that is permitted or consented to
under this Agreement (a " _Permitted Grizzly Financing_ "), including (i)
furnishing Grizzly and its financing sources the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of Spinco and its Subsidiaries and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows as of the end of any
quarterly period that ends between the execution of this Agreement and the
forty-fifth (45th) day prior to the Closing Date, and all Spinco information,
financial statements and financial data of a type and form customarily

for financings similar to the Spinco Exchange Debt and subject to exceptions
customary for such financings and including audited financial statements for
each of the three most recent fiscal years ending more than ninety (90) days
prior to the Closing Date (the information required to be delivered pursuant
to this clause (i) being referred to as the " _Required Financial Information_
"), (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary
one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for,
and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Spinco Financing, the Spinco

and expenses related to the Spinco Financing and the Burgundy Financing
(including all fees under the Spinco Related Letter and the Burgundy Related
Letter and all indemnity claims under any of them), and all underwriting,
sale, distribution, placement or other fees, and indemnity claims, in
connection with the distribution of Spinco Exchange Debt, whether prior to or
subsequent to Closing; provided, that each party shall be solely responsible
for the fees and expenses of its respective counsel and other consultants in

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Burgundy Commitment Letter
contemplates, and Burgundy desires to enter into, arrangements providing for
the exchange by Burgundy of Spinco Exchange Debt distributed to Burgundy as

satisfaction of debt obligations of Burgundy borrowed pursuant to definitive
documentation contemplated by the Burgundy Commitment Letter (the " _Burgundy
Debt_ ") (such exchange, the " _Debt Exchange_ "), which Burgundy Debt shall
provide net proceeds equal to the Above Basis Amount. Spinco shall issue
Spinco Exchange Debt to Burgundy immediately prior to the Effective Time with
an interest rate up to the Total Cap if necessary to effectuate the Debt
Exchange. Each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to

determine the final form of the Spinco Exchange Debt and related agreements
(including registration rights arrangements and indenture). Burgundy shall, in
consultation with Grizzly, determine the arrangements relating to the Debt
Exchange; _provided_ that Burgundy shall keep Grizzly reasonably informed
regarding such arrangements. Spinco shall issue the Spinco Exchange Debt to
Burgundy on the terms negotiated by Grizzly immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and Grizzly shall accept and execute applicable documentation, if any,
relating to the issuance of the Spinco Securities by Spinco and the transfer
of the Spinco Exchange Debt by Burgundy in satisfaction of the Burgundy Debt.

 



 

(ii) Each of Burgundy, Spinco and Grizzly shall cooperate in connection with
the preparation of all documents and the making of all filings required in
connection with the issuance of the Spinco Exchange Debt and the Debt Exchange
and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be

connection with the foregoing, and (D) take all other actions reasonably
necessary in connection with the issuance of the Spinco Exchange Debt and the

Exchange: (A) providing Grizzly with the Required Financial Information and
(B) taking all other actions reasonably necessary in connection with the
issuance of the Spinco Exchange Debt and the Debt Exchange.

the event that the Burgundy Commitment Letter is modified in accordance with
_Section 8.3_), and (B) the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ (other than
those that would be satisfied at the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date and other than the condition in _Section 9.2(f)_) shall have been
satisfied (or, to the extent permissible by law, waived by Burgundy), then
either, as Burgundy shall elect, at its sole discretion, Burgundy shall (1)
waive the condition in _Section 9.2(f)_ and require Spinco to issue to
Burgundy Spinco Securities with an interest rate equal to the Total Cap in
satisfaction of the Special Above Basis Debt/Cash Distribution, or (2) (I)
waive the condition in _Section 9.2(f)_, (II) if the commitment for a bridge

Debt/Cash Distribution in accordance with clause (1) of the foregoing, Grizzly
and Spinco shall following the Closing reasonably cooperate with Burgundy in
connection with the preparation of all documents and the making of all filings
required in connection with a subsequent sale of the Spinco Securities,
including taking all such actions as are required of Grizzly pursuant to
clauses (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 8.11(f)_ with respect to the Spinco
Exchange Debt.

$225,000,000 pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each party will use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable,
pursuant to the Burgundy Commitment Letter and the Spinco Commitment Letter
and all other financing arrangements contemplated hereby to take into account
such increase in the Below Basis Amount.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Public Announcements_. Burgundy and Grizzly shall consult with
each other and shall mutually agree upon any press release or public
announcement relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
neither of them shall issue any such press release or make any such public

required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation
system, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make
such public announcement shall use all reasonable best efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before issuing any such press release or
making any such public announcement; _provided_ that, subject to _Section

Burgundy, Spinco or Grizzly shall settle any such action, suit or proceeding
or fail to perfect on a timely basis any right to appeal any judgment rendered
or order entered against such party therein without having previously
consulted with the other parties. Each of Burgundy, Spinco and Grizzly shall
use all reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Affiliates, directors and
officers

 



      
 

 



 

to use all reasonable best efforts to defend any such action, suit or
proceeding in which such Affiliate, director or officer is named as a
defendant and which seeks any such relief to comply with this _Section 8.13_
to the same extent as if such Person was a party.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Advice of Changes_. Burgundy and Grizzly shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable after becoming aware thereof advise the other of (a)
any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (b) the failure by it to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement that could be complied with or satisfied by it at such time under
this Agreement, or which has resulted, or which, insofar as can reasonably be
foreseen, would result, in any of the conditions that could be satisfied at
such time set forth in _Article IX_ not being satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The failure to comply with
the covenants, conditions or agreements contained in this _Section 8.14_
shall not be taken into account when determining whether the conditions set
forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_ have been satisfied.

(a) In furtherance of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby,
Burgundy covenants and agrees that, for a period beginning on the Effective
Date and ending on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time, neither
Burgundy nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent
of Grizzly, engage, directly or indirectly, in the Eagle Business as conducted
as of the Effective Date (the " _Grizzly Restricted Business_ ") anywhere
throughout the world. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing:

 



 

(i) nothing in this Section 8.24(a) shall prohibit Burgundy or its
Subsidiaries from engaging in the businesses conducted by Burgundy or its
Subsidiaries (excluding the Eagle Business) on the Effective Date;

 



 

(ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 8.24(a)_ shall prohibit Burgundy or
its Subsidiaries from owning not in excess of 5% in the aggregate of any class
of capital stock or other equity interest of any Person engaged in the Grizzly
Restricted Business;

 



 

(iii) in the event that Burgundy completes a business combination transaction
with a Person, which transaction results in the holders of the voting
securities of Burgundy outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of
such transaction owning less than 50% of the voting power of the voting
securities of Burgundy or the surviving entity in the transaction or any
parent thereof (any such entity, an " _Acquiror_ ") outstanding immediately
after the consummation of such transaction, such Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (but not Burgundy or any of its Subsidiaries) may
engage in any Grizzly Restricted Business;

 



 

(iv) Burgundy may acquire interests in or securities of any Person as an
investment by their pension funds or funds of any other benefit plan of
Burgundy whether or not such Person is engaged in any Grizzly Restricted
Business;

activities that constitute Grizzly Restricted Businesses; provided that such
Person may not use the Burgundy name in connection with the activities that
constitute Grizzly Restricted Businesses; and

 



 

(vi) Burgundy may perform their obligations under this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements.

 



 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing herein shall be deemed
to require Burgundy to give notice to or obtain the consent of the Grizzly in
order to engage in any activity or transaction of the types described in
_Section 8.24(a)(i)_ through _Section 8.24(a)(vi)_ and that, in the event
the TCI Interests are not transferred to Spinco at the Closing, nothing in
this _Section 8.24(a)_ shall prevent or limit in any way Burgundys ability
to hold the TCI Interests and to take

 



      
 

 



 

any actions in connection with its ownership of the TCI Interests for so long
as the TCI Interests are not transferred to Spinco.

 



 

(b) Burgundy acknowledges and agrees that the covenants included in this
_Section 8.24_ are, taken as a whole, reasonable in their geographic and
temporal coverage and Burgundy shall not raise any issue of geographic or
temporal reasonableness in any proceeding to enforce such covenant; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the provisions of this _Section 8.24_ should ever be
deemed to exceed the time or geographic limitations or any other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be
deemed reformed in such jurisdiction to the minimum extent required by
applicable Law to cure such problem. Burgundy acknowledges and agrees that in
the event of a breach by Burgundy of the provisions of this _Section 8.24_,
monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in
the event of any such breach, the Grizzly may, in addition to any other rights
and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law or equity of
competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or preliminary and final
injunctive relief or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation
of the provisions hereof, without the necessity of proving actual damages or
posting a bond.

 



 

Section 8.25 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_.

 



 

(a) Burgundy and Grizzly each agree that, for a period of two (2) years from
and after the Closing Date, they shall not, and they shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of the other
party, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire or hire (or cause or seek to
cause to leave the employ of the other party or the other partys Subsidiary),
or enter into a consulting agreement with, any employee or category of
employee of the other party or the other partys Subsidiaries listed in
_Schedule 8.25_.

 



 

(b) The restrictions set forth in _Section 8.25(a)_ shall not apply to (i)
general solicitations (such as advertisements) for employment placed by a
party or any partys Subsidiary and not specifically targeted at the other

(ii) responding to or hiring any employee of the other party (or of the other
partys Subsidiary) who contacts a party without any prior solicitation (other
than as permitted by clause (i) above).

Supply Agreement; the Electric Generation, Distribution and Transmission
Facilities Lease; Shared Facilities Agreement  Monroeville; and the Servitude
Agreement attached as Exhibits B, D, C, L and E, respectively, to the
Separation Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the current forms have
been partially negotiated between the parties but the terms of the forms
including the pricing and the scope of services provided therein remain
subject to further review and revision after Grizzly is provided appropriate
access to personnel and information not available prior to the date hereof.
The parties intend that the agreements shall allow the parties to operate in
the ordinary course after the Business Transfer Time and facilitate the
transition of the Eagle Business to Grizzly and the separation of the Eagle
Business from Burgundy. The parties agree that all pricing for the services
provided under such agreements

 



      
 

 



 

shall be consistent with the economics in the financials of the Eagle Business
provided by Burgundy to Grizzly prior to the date of this Agreement.

obligation under this Agreement (including such partys obligations set forth

provisions of this _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_ and _Article XI_),
without any liability on the part _of any Person_ other than Burgundy and
Grizzly to the extent set forth in _Section 10.3_; provided that nothing in
this Agreement shall relieve any party of liability for fraud or willful
breach of this Agreement or the Separation Agreement prior to such
termination.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Termination Fee Payable in Certain Circumstances_.

 



 

(a) Grizzly shall pay to Burgundy or its designee the Grizzly Termination Fee,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Burgundy, as follows:

 



 

(i) (A) In the event that, after the date hereof, a Grizzly Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made to Grizzly, or directly to the stockholders of
Grizzly generally, or a Grizzly Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise
become publicly known or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make a Grizzly Acquisition Proposal, and (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated (1) by either party pursuant to
_Section 10.1(b)_, (2) by Burgundy pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_ due to
breach by Grizzly of its covenants under this Agreement, or (3) by either
party pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_ (and, in the case of this clause (3)
only, such Grizzly Acquisition Proposal or such announcement of an intention
to make a Grizzly Acquisition Proposal is publicly known and shall not have
been irrevocably withdrawn at least five (5) days prior to the Grizzly
Stockholders Meeting), and (C) within twelve (12) months after such
termination of this Agreement, any Grizzly Acquisition shall have been
consummated or any definitive agreement with respect to any Grizzly
Acquisition shall have been entered into (the earlier of entry into such
agreement or the consummation thereof, the " _Grizzly Termination Fee Date_
"), then, in any such case, Grizzly shall pay Burgundy a fee in the amount of
$24,500,000 (the " _Grizzly Termination Fee_ ") (less any amounts paid by
Grizzly to

 



      
 

 



 

Burgundy pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)(iii)_) within two (2) Business Days of
the Grizzly Termination Fee Date; _provided_ that solely for purposes of this
_Section 10.3(a)(i)_, the term "Grizzly Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning ascribed thereto in _Article I_, except that all references in such
definition to 25% shall be changed to 50%;

 



 

(ii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Burgundy pursuant to
_Section 10.1(g)_, Grizzly shall promptly, and in any event not more than two
(2) Business Days following such termination, pay Burgundy the Grizzly
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds;

 



 

(iii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Grizzly or
Burgundy pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_, Grizzly shall pay Burgundy all out-
of-pocket fees and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Burgundy,
Spinco and their respective Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Burgundy Expenses_ "), up to a maximum
of the Burgundy Expense Limitation. In the event of a termination by Grizzly
pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_, Grizzly shall pay the Burgundy Expenses
concurrently with any such termination and, in the case of a termination by
Burgundy pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_, Grizzly shall pay the Burgundy
Expenses not more than two (2) Business Days following any such termination,
in each case by wire transfer of same day funds. The payment of the Burgundy
Expenses pursuant to this _Section 10.3(a)(iii)_ shall not relieve Grizzly of
any subsequent obligation to pay the Grizzly Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 10.3(a)(i)_, less the amount paid pursuant to this _Section
10.3(a)(iii)_; and

 



 

(iv) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Grizzly pursuant to
_Section 10.1(h),_ Burgundy shall pay Grizzly all out-of-pocket fees and
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Grizzly and its Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Grizzly
Expenses_ "), up to a maximum of the Grizzly Expense Limitation, not more than
two (2) Business Days following any such termination, by wire transfer of same
day funds.

 



 

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Grizzly be requir
_ed to pay more t_ han one Grizzly Termination Fee or to pay the Burgundy
Expenses if it has paid the Grizzly Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, upon payment of the Grizzly Termination Fee
in accordance with _Section 10.3(a)_, Grizzly shall have no further liability
to Burgundy or Spinco or their respective stockholders with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the obligation
to pay any amount payable pursuant to _Section 10.3(c)_.

 



 

(c) In the event that Grizzly shall fail to pay when due the Grizzly
Termination Fee or the Burgundy Expenses required to be paid by it pursuant to
this _Section 10.3_, or Burgundy shall fail to pay when due the Grizzly
Expenses pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)(iv)_ , such Grizzly Termination Fee or
Burgundy Expenses, or Grizzly Expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such Grizzly Termination Fee or
Burgundy Expenses, or Grizzly Expenses, became past due, at a rate equal to
the sum of (x) the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ plus (y) 5%, calculated on a daily
basis until the date of actual payment. In addition, if either party shall
fail to pay the Grizzly

 



      
 

 



 

Termination Fee or Burgundy Expenses, or Grizzly Expenses, as the case may be,
when due, such defaulting party shall also pay to the other party all of the
other partys costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), as
applicable, in connection with efforts to collect such amounts.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by Burgundy, Spinco,
Grizzly and Merger Sub at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement
by the stockholders of Grizzly; _provided_ , _however_ , that after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made that by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation
system requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by Burgundy, Spinco, Grizzly and Merger Sub.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Burgundy,
Spinco, Grizzly and Merger Sub may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
parties; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
any of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of any of the other parties contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no failure or delay by Burgundy, Spinco, Grizzly
or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of Burgundy, Spinco, Grizzly or Merger Sub to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 11.4 _Interpretation_. (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement
to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The descriptive headings herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a
substantive part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes,
including all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
References to a date or time shall be deemed to be such date or time in New
York City, unless otherwise specified. References to dollar amounts are to
U.S. dollars, unless otherwise specified. Each of the parties has participated
in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it
is drafted by all the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, "consistent with past
practice" when used with respect to Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries means
the past practice of Burgundy with respect to the Eagle Business. Except as
other wise expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the Separation
Agreement, or any other Transaction Agreement, any provision herein which
contemplates the agreement, approval or consent of, or exercise of any right
of, a party, such party may give or withhold such agreement, approval or
consent, or exercise such right, in its sole and absolute discretion.

 



 

(b) Any matter disclosed in any particular Section or Subsection of the
Burgundy Disclosure Letter, the Burgundy Disclosure Letter or the Grizzly
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to have been disclosed in any other Section
or Subsection of this Agreement, with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to which such matter is relevant so long as the applicability of such matter
to such Section or Subsection is reasonably apparent on its face.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of any provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared
judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have
the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it
being the intent and agreement of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall
be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to
render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such
modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that
is legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of all of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 11.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than
Burgundy, Spinco and Grizzly and their respective successors and permitted
assigns) any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no Person (other than as
so specified) shall be deemed a third party beneficiary under or by reason of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each financing source under the
Spinco Commitment Letter and Related Letters shall be an express third party
beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon _Section 11.10_, _Section
11.12_ and _Section 11.14_ hereof, and each such financing source and its
successors and assigns may enforce such provisions.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Limited Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or
representative of any of the parties hereto, in its capacity as such, shall
have any liability in respect of or relating to the covenants, obligations,
representations or warranties of such party under this Agreement or in respect
of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto and, to the
fullest extent legally permissible, each of the parties hereto, for itself and
its stockholders, directors, officers and Affiliates, waives and agrees not to
seek to assert or enforce any such liability that any such Person otherwise
might have pursuant to applicable Law.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the other
Transaction Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and the
Disclosure Letters and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto)
constitutes the entire agreement of all the parties hereto and supersedes all
prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. All exhibits attached to this Agreement and the Disclosure Letters are
expressly made a part of, and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one party), each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and
any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, will be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement and will be considered to have
the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of a party, the other party will
re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting party. No
party will raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic means as
a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Jurisdiction; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) _Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any
claim, dispute or controversy (of any and every kind or type, whether based on
contract, tort, statute, regulation or otherwise, and whether based on state,
federal, foreign or any other law), arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and including disputes relating to the existence, validity, breach or
termination of this Agreement (any such claim being a " _Covered Claim_ "),
may be brought and determined in any federal or state court located in the
State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits
in respect of Covered Claims for itself and in respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and agrees that it may be served with such legal process at the address
and in the manner set forth in _Section 11.3_. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding in respect of
Covered Claims (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to lawfully serve process, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii ) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, that
(A) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper and (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. The parties hereby further agree that New York
state or United States Federal courts sitting in the borough of Manhattan,
City of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action brought
against any financing source under the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Spinco
Related Letter in connection with the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS

 



      
 

 



 

CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.12 (b)_.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or threatened
default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, the party who is, or is to be,
thereby aggrieved will have the right to specific performance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Transaction Agreement and
injunctive or other equitable relief in respect of its rights under this
Agreement or such Transaction Agreement, in addition to any and all other
rights and remedies at law or in equity. The parties agree that the remedies
at law for any breach or threatened breach, including monetary damages, are
inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are
waived by each of the parties to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Certain Lender Agreements_. Burgundy agrees, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives (collectively, the
" _Burgundy Related Parties_ "), that the financing sources under the Spinco
Commitment Letter and Spinco Related Letter and their Affiliates, stockholders
and Representatives and each of their successors and assigns (i) shall be
subject to no liability or claims by the Burgundy Related Parties arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, the Spinco Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except with respect to the enforcement of the Burgundy
Commitment Letter) or in connection with the Spinco Financing, or the
performance of services by such financing sources or their Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to the foregoing and (ii) are express third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 11.14_ (which may not be changed as to any
