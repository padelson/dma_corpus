Hundred Twenty Million Dollars ($120,000,000) (the " _Base Purchase Price_ ").
Payment of the Base Purchase Price shall be made in accordance with Section
2.3(a).

adjustment shall be equal to the amount, if any, by which the Shareholders
Equity as of the close of business on September 30, 2007 (" _Closing
Shareholders  Equity_") differs from $24,124,711.00, which is the
Shareholders Equity set forth in the 2006 Company Financial Statements (the "

  underwriting gain or loss, if any, with respect to its 7.5% retention for the
2007 Underwriting Year, minus (iii) any of AA-BICs unrecoverable reinsurance

share, underwriting gain or loss, unrecoverable reinsurance or other element

six months thereafter until the sooner of the final settlement of all claims
related to the 2007 Underwriting Year or the expiration of the Escrow

Sellers, an updated Underwriting Profit Adjustment Statement and certification
statement in substantially the same form and method as that described in
Section 2.3(c)(i). In the event the Underwriting Profit Adjustment is less
than the Underwriting Profit Adjustment previously paid to the Sellers,
the Underwriting Profit Adjustment shall reduce the amount of the Purchase
Price. In the event the Underwriting Profit Adjustment is greater than the
Underwriting Profit Adjustment previously paid to the Sellers, the
Underwriting Profit Adjustment shall increase the amount of the Purchase
Price. Payment of the Underwriting Profit Adjustment shall be made in

shall assign to Sellers the right to recover any amount of AA-BICs
reinsurance related to the 2007 or prior underwriting years, but solely to the
extent such reinsurance is charged against Sellers as unrecoverable and
reduces the Underwriting Profit Adjustment.

TAX MATTERS

   

Section 8.1. _Tax Indemnity_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, each Seller shall severally and
not jointly be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold Buyer and all of
Buyers Affiliates, which for purposes of this Article VIII, shall include the
Companies (the " _Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties_ "), harmless against (i) any
liability for Taxes and related Losses imposed on or with respect to the
Companies (including, without limitation, all such Taxes imposed on such
Seller) that relates to, arises out of or is attributable to any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date, and for the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "),
(ii) any Taxes and related Losses resulting from or attributable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that are undertaken at the
direction of or for the benefit of such Seller; (iii) any Taxes or Losses
relating to, arising out of or resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of the
representations set forth in Section 5.24 or any covenants or agreements
relating to Tax matters set forth in this Agreement; (iv) all Taxes imposed
with respect to the Underwriting Profit Adjustment; and (v) all Transfer Taxes
(clauses (i) - (v) hereinafter referred to as the " _Tax Losses_ ");

indemnify Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties for any Taxes specifically accrued
for on the Reference Statement. The amount of any indemnification due from
Sellers to any Buyer Tax Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement shall be net of any actual Tax Benefit received by the Companies
that are directly attributable to the Loss relating to such indemnity payment.
To the extent any such Tax Benefit is realized subsequent to an indemnity
payment being made by Sellers to Buyer or the Company, such indemnity payment
shall not be subject to offset as provided above, and upon such Tax Benefit
actually being realized (as determined above) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the
amount of such realized Tax Benefit no later than 10 days after the filing of
the Tax Return which reflects such Tax Benefit. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the indemnification provided for in this
Section 8.1(a) shall not be affected by the disclosure of any item on any
Schedule to this Agreement.

 

(b) For purposes of Section 8.1(a), in the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date
and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any
such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date shall be:

 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related
to income, or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible),
deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended
with (and included) the Closing Date;

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are based upon gross premiums deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable with respect to the premium written
as of the Closing Date; and

  (iii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets of the Companies, or otherwise measured by the level of any item,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

 

Section 8.2. _Tax Payments_. All payments due from Sellers with respect
to Taxes for which Sellers have provided the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties

a Tax Claim, a resolution, agreement or settlement being reached with the
applicable Tax authority.

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, the
Companies shall (i) prepare and file all Tax Returns which are required to be
filed under Applicable Law during such period in a manner that is consistent
with past practice to the extent that such past practices are not contrary to
Applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Companies shall not take any positions
on any such Tax Returns that could adversely affect the Companies or Buyer for
taxable periods (or portions thereof) commencing after the Closing Date
without first obtaining Buyers written consent and no later than 45 days
prior to the filing of any such Tax Return (taking into account any extension
of time that is applicable to the person filing such Tax Return if such
extension is claimed) the Companies shall provide to Buyer copies of all such
Tax Returns for Buyer\'s review and comments and the Companies shall in good
faith take into account all reasonable comments provided by Buyer with respect
to such Tax Returns to the extent such comments are provided no later than ten
(10) days prior to the relevant actual filing date and (ii) reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax
Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding Transfer
Taxes and take all reasonable steps necessary to obtain any exemptions from
such Transfer Taxes.

 

(b) With respect to all Tax Returns filed by the Companies after the
Closing Date and which report an amount of Tax for which Sellers, in whole or
in part, are liable (except for the federal income Tax Returns to be filed by
ARMtech and ARMIS for the tax period that ends on the Closing Date), the
Companies shall provide the relevant Sellers with a copy of such Tax Return no
later than 45 days prior to filing (taking into account any extension of time
that is applicable to the person filing such Tax Return if such extension is
claimed). Sellers shall provide any comments regarding such Tax Returns to
Buyer in writing no later than twenty (20) days prior to such relevant filing
date with sufficient detail to reasonably allow Buyer to determine the nature
and basis of Sellers\' disputed item(s). If any such disputes cannot be
settled by the parties by such date then the disputed items shall be presented
to the Accountant for settlement and the decision of such Accountant shall be
binding upon the parties. The cost of such Accountant shall be shared equally
by Buyer (50%) and Sellers (50%).

  (c) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Sellers, at their expense,
shall have the right to cause the Accountant to prepare and file the United
States federal income Tax Return Form 1120S required to be filed by ARMtech
and ARMIS for the tax period ending on the Closing Date (which shall include
that part of the years operations for each of those two Companies ending on
the Closing Date). Such Tax Returns shall include and take into account the
Underwriting Profit Adjustment to the extent permitted by law. The Companies,
at Sellers expense, shall use reasonable efforts to provide Sellers and their
advisors with such access and information as is reasonably requested by
Sellers by written notice and to the extent such information or access is
reasonably necessary to prepare and file complete and accurate Tax Returns
consistent with the time requirements set out in this Section 8.3. Sellers
shall provide the Companies with a copy of such Tax Returns no later than 45
days prior to filing (taking into account any extension of time that is
applicable to the person filing such Tax Return if such extension is claimed).
The Companies shall provide any comments regarding such Tax Returns to Sellers
in writing no later than twenty (20) days prior to the relevant filing date
with sufficient detail to reasonably allow Sellers to determine the nature and
basis of Companies disputed item(s). If any such disputes cannot be settled
by the parties by the date such Tax Returns are required to be filed, then
such Tax Returns will be filed in a manner that is consistent with Buyers
positions and such disputed items shall be presented to the Accountant for
settlement and the decision of the Accountant shall be binding upon the
parties. The cost of the Accountant shall be shared equally by Buyer (50%) and
Sellers (50%); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Accountant determines that
Buyers positions are correct the cost of the Accountants services in
connection with such dispute shall be paid by Sellers. ****

 

Section 8.4. _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund (including any interest with
respect thereto) relating to ARMtech Holdings or AA-BIC for Taxes paid for any
Taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (except to the extent
any such refund is specifically accounted for as an asset on the Reference
Statement, in which case such Tax refund is for the account of Buyer) shall be
the property of Sellers, and if received by Buyer shall be paid over promptly
to Sellers. All other refunds of Taxes (including any interest with respect
thereto) of the Companies shall be for the account of Buyer and if received by
Sellers shall be promptly paid to Buyer. Buyer shall provide Sellers (at
Sellers\' written request and cost) with such reasonable assistance as is
necessary to allow Sellers to claim a refund of Taxes that is Sellers\'
property pursuant to this Section 8.4; provided, that such assistance shall
not include in any manner Buyer agreeing to carryback any Tax attribute of the
Companies or Buyer to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

  

Section 8.5. _Tax Controversy_.

  

(a) Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, will notify the other party
in writing within 30 days (a " _Tax Claim Notice_ ") of its discovery of any
matter that may give rise to a claim for indemnity by the Buyer Tax
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VIII (a " _Tax Claim_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to comply with this clause by Buyer
shall not affect Sellers\' indemnification obligation hereunder except only
to the extent Sellers ability to control such Tax Claim is adversely and
materially affected by such failure. A Tax Claim Notice shall contain a
summary of the facts (set forth with reasonable specificity) underlying or
relating to the relevant claim, any correspondence or notice received from any
third party with respect thereto,

  and if provided by Buyer, a statement that Buyer seeks indemnification for
Taxes relating to such claim.

 

(b) (i) Sellers, at their expense, shall have the right to control
the conduct of the defense of any Tax Claim that involves solely a matter for
which Sellers shall be liable and are required to indemnify the Buyer Tax
Indemnified Parties against; _provided_ , that (1) Buyer is provided written
notice within 15 days of receiving a Tax Claim Notice (which will include
Sellers acknowledgement that it is liable for all Taxes and Losses of the
Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties that result or arise from such Tax Claim) that
Sellers have elected to control the defense of such Tax Claim and (2)
Sellers\' will not have the right to control or settle any such Tax Claim if
the resolution or determination of such Tax Claim could materially adversely
affect or prejudice any of the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties, on an aggregate
or individual basis, which for purposes of this provision ''materially'' shall
be determined by reference solely to the Company to which such claim relates
as it exists as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall control the conduct of all
other Tax Claims. Buyer shall have the right to participate in the conduct of
the defense of any Tax Claim controlled by Sellers and Sellers (at their
expense) will have the right to participate in any Tax Claim that is not
controlled by Sellers; provided, that such Tax Claim (i) relates solely to the
Companies and (ii) could adversely affect Sellers.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the parties agree that they will not settle, compromise or agree to any Tax
adjustment with respect to any Tax Claim without first obtaining the prior
written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, if such compromise, settlement or agreement materially
affects or could materially affect the other partys Tax liability; _provided_
, _however_ , that Buyer shall have the right to settle or compromise any such
proceeding if such proceeding does not relate solely to the Companies.

 

Section 8.6. _Tax Cooperation_. The parties will provide each other
with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request
of the other with respect to any Tax matter at the expense of the requesting
party. Such cooperation and information shall include providing signatures
with respect to any Tax Returns that must be filed, and providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by taxing authorities. Sellers shall each make themselves
available upon reasonable notice and for a reasonable period of time to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder. Each
Seller, Buyer and its Affiliates shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and
work papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax
matters of the Companies until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute
of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions, or (ii) six years following
the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Prior to disposing of
any such records, notice shall be given to the other party providing
reasonable terms allowing such other party to take, at its sole expense,
possession of such records.

 

Section 8.7. _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, all stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, registration, filing, sales, use, recording, ad valorem,
and other similar Taxes arising out of, or directly attributable to, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will

  be borne and paid by Sellers. Sellers shall to the extent allowed by
Applicable Law pay any such Taxes prior to the Closing Date and in all other
cases no later than the day any such Taxes are required to be paid pursuant to
Applicable Law and shall cooperate with Buyer with respect to any such
payments and the filing of any Tax Returns related thereto.

  

Section 8.8. _Miscellaneous_.

  

(a) Sellers and Buyer agree to treat all payments made between or
among them under this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to
the extent that the laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise.

 

(b) All agreements among and between the Companies providing for the
sharing or allocation of Taxes between members of the same combined,
consolidated, unified or affiliated group shall be terminated immediately
prior to the Closing Date and shall have no continuing force or effect. The
Companies and Sellers shall, unless otherwise directed by Buyer, terminate any
power of attorney granted by or on behalf of any Company, and any such
terminated power of attorney shall have no continuing force or effect after
the Closing Date.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
all agreements, covenants and indemnification matters contained in this
Article VIII and the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.24
shall survive the Closing and shall not terminate until 60 days after the
expiration of all relevant statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that upon Buyer providing Sellers with notice of any claim for indemnity
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) prior to the applicable date determined pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence, the representations, warranties
and agreements that are the subject of such indemnification claim shall
survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is resolved.

representations and warranties of the parties set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2,
4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 and 5.5 shall survive the Closing without limitation as to

anniversary date of the Closing Date. Notice with respect to any claim in
respect of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
shall be in writing and shall be given to the party against which such claim
is asserted. Any representation or warranty shall survive the time it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to this Section 10.1 to the extent that the party
claiming indemnification for a breach thereof shall have delivered to the

  other party written notice setting forth with reasonable specificity the basis
of such claim prior to the expiration of such time pursuant to this Section
10.1; _provided_ , that after the delivery of any such notice, the party
claiming indemnification continues to expeditiously pursue the resolution of
such claim.

 

(b) All covenants and agreements made by the parties to this
Agreement which contemplate performance following the Closing Date (including,
without limitation, Section 7.3) shall survive the Closing Date. All other
covenants and agreements shall not survive the Closing Date and shall
terminate as of the Closing to the extent that such covenants were performed
in accordance with their terms.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Closing occurs, (i) Sellers hereby irrevocably and forever waive and
release any right to indemnification, contribution, reimbursement, set-off or
other rights to recovery that Sellers might otherwise have against the
Companies with respect to representations and warranties made with respect to,
and the covenants, obligations and agreements that contemplate action at or
prior to the Closing by, the Companies in this Agreement, and (ii) such
representations and warranties and such covenants, obligations and agreements
shall terminate solely with respect to the Companies (but not as to Sellers).

 

(d) The right to indemnification or other remedy based upon the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and agreements of the
parties to this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable or being acquired) at
any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or
agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant, obligation or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations or agreements.

 

Section 10.2. _Indemnification_. (a) Subject to Sections 10.1 and 10.4,
subject to and after the Closing, Sellers shall severally and not jointly (in
proportion to the Purchase Price allocation among Sellers set forth in the

employees and Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies, and
their respective successors and assigns (each, a " _Buyer Indemnitee_ "),
against, and hold each Buyer Indemnitee harmless from, any damage, claim,
loss, Liability or expense, including, without limitation, interest, penalties
and reasonable attorneys fees (collectively, " _Losses_ "), based upon,
arising out of or otherwise in respect of (i) any breach by such Seller or the
Companies of any of their respective representations or warranties contained
herein, or the certificates delivered at the Closing pursuant to Sections
9.1(a)(iv) and 9.1(b)(iv), (ii) any breach by such Seller of any of its or the
Companies respective covenants or agreements contained herein (including but
not limited to the agreements of each Seller contained in Section 12.1), (iii)
any Loss arising out of, resulting from or associated with (x) the conduct or
business operation of any Company prior to the Closing Date, or (y) any former
employee or former leased or temporary employee of any Company prior to the
Closing Date, (iv) any claims made in connection with the sale to ARMtech, Inc
by Samuel R. Scheef, Lance Ekersell and Jerry

  Jackson of shares of common stock of ARMtech Holdings, Inc. and (v) any Loss
incident to any of the foregoing. The amount of any indemnification due from
such Seller pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall not exceed the
after-tax economic impact of the Loss on a Buyer Indemnitee.

 

(b) Subject to Sections 10.1 and 10.4, prior to the Closing or if
this Agreement terminates prior to the Closing, the Companies shall jointly
and severally indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees against, and hold each Buyer
Indemnitee harmless from, any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise
in respect of any breach by any Company of any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein.

 

(c) No indemnification payments shall be payable to a Buyer
Indemnitee with respect to the indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant
to Section 10.2(a) or the indemnification obligations of the Companies
pursuant to this Section 10.2(b) unless the total aggregate indemnification
obligations under such Sections exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000.00) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "). Once the Threshold Amount is
satisfied, Sellers or the Companies, as the case may be, shall pay to such
Buyer Indemnitee all indemnification obligations in excess of the Threshold
Amount, subject to the provisions of Section 3.2(c).

 

(d) Subject to Sections 10.1 and 10.4, Buyer shall indemnify Sellers
and their directors, officers, employees and Affiliates, and, prior to the
Closing, the Companies and their respective successors and assigns (each, a "
_Seller Indemnitee_ "), against, and hold each Seller Indemnitee harmless
from, any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of (i) any
breach by Buyer of any of its representations or warranties contained herein
or the certificate delivered at the Closing pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(iv) and
(ii) any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements contained
herein.

 

(e) The term "Losses" as used in this Article X is not limited to
matters asserted by third parties against any Person entitled to be
indemnified under this Article X, but includes Losses incurred or sustained by
any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee in the absence of third party
claims.

 

Section 10.3. _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) Upon any Person entitled
to be indemnified under this Article X (the " _Indemnified Person_ ") becoming
aware of a fact, condition or event for which indemnification is provided
under this Article X, the Indemnified Person will with reasonable promptness
notify the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying
Person_ ") in writing of such fact, condition or event; _provided_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not prejudice the Indemnified Persons
right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Person is materially prejudiced thereby. If such fact, condition or event is
the assertion of a claim by a third party, the Indemnifying Person will be
entitled to assume the defense and investigation against such claim;
_provided_ , that the Indemnifying Person and its counsel shall proceed with
diligence and in good faith with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
Indemnifying Persons election to assume the defense or investigation of such
claim, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel
and to participate in the defense or investigation of such claim, action or
proceeding, and the Indemnifying Person shall bear the expense of one firm of
such separate counsel, if and only

  if (i) use of counsel of the Indemnifying Persons choice would give rise to a
conflict of interest, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have employed
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the
Indemnified Person within a reasonable time after notice of the assertion of
any such claim or institution of any such action or proceeding or (iii) the
Indemnifying Person shall authorize the Indemnified Person in writing to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Person. An
Indemnifying Person who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense and investigation of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons with respect to
such claim.

 

(b) Neither the Indemnified Person nor the Indemnifying Person shall
make any settlement of any claim which would give rise to liability on the
part of the Indemnifying Person under this Article X without the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ , that an Indemnified Person shall not be required to consent to
any settlement involving the imposition of equitable remedies or involving the
imposition of any material obligations on such Indemnified Person other than
financial obligations for which such Indemnified Person will be indemnified
hereunder. No Indemnifying Person shall consent to entry of any judgment
or shall enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Person
of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.
Whenever the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person receives a firm
offer to settle a claim for which indemnification is sought under this Article
X, it shall promptly notify the other of such offer. If the Indemnifying
Person refuses to accept such offer within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such offer (or of notice thereof), such claim shall continue to be
contested and, if such claim is within the scope of the Indemnifying Persons
indemnity contained in this Article X, the Indemnified Person shall be
indemnified pursuant to the terms hereof. If the Indemnifying Person notifies
the Indemnified Person in writing that the Indemnifying Person desires to
accept such offer, but the Indemnified Person refuses to accept such offer (in
a manner permitted by this Section 10.3) within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Person may continue to contest such
claim and, in such event, the total maximum liability of the Indemnifying
Person to indemnify or otherwise reimburse the Indemnified Person hereunder
with respect to such claim shall be limited to and shall not exceed the amount
of such offer, plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) to the date of notice that the
Indemnifying Person desires to accept such offer; _provided_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not withhold its consent to any settlement of any
claim that does not involve the imposition of equitable remedies on any
Indemnified Party and does not impose any material obligations on such
Indemnified Person other than financial obligations for which the Indemnifying
Party has acknowledged in writing such Indemnified Person will be indemnified
hereunder. If the Indemnifying Person disputes its liability with respect to
any claim, a representative of each of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute, and if not resolved through the negotiations of such
representatives or designees within 60 days after the delivery of the
Indemnified Partys notice of such claim, such dispute (except for any such
dispute which gives rise or could give rise to equitable relief under this
Agreement) shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution
procedures set forth in Section 12.10.

  (c) Buyers indemnification claims pursuant to Article VIII and this
Article X may be settled from and limited to Buyers withdrawal of amounts
from the escrow account pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement attached as Exhibit D hereto subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 3.2(c) (except for any indemnification claim seeking to recover any
Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of (i) fraud or
intentional misrepresentation on the part of any Seller, (ii) the Tax
indemnity provided by Sellers under Article VIII of this Agreement, (iii)
Transfer Taxes, (iv) Sellers liability under this Agreement for fees of the
Escrow Agent, the Accountant, any arbitrator or Sellers counsel, (v)
Sellers failure to pay Buyer a negative Shareholders Equity Adjustment as
determined in accordance with Section 2.2(b), or (vi) Sellers failure to pay
Buyer a negative Underwriting Profit Adjustment as determined in accordance
with Section 2.2(c)).

 

Section 10.4. _Exclusive Remedy; Tax Indemnification_. The remedies and
procedures set forth in Article VIII, this Article X and in Section 12.10 with
respect to the dispute resolution procedures, are the sole and exclusive
remedies and procedures available to the parties for financial Losses under
this Agreement or certificates delivered under this Agreement at Closing,
except that the foregoing shall not preclude any party (a) from seeking
specific performance against any other party with respect to the performance
or non-performance by such other party of its obligations under this Agreement
(including but not limited to obligations under Section 12.1) or (b) from
seeking to recover any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in
respect of (i) claims of Buyer with respect to fraud or intentional
misrepresentation on the part of any Seller; (ii) Tax indemnity claims of
Buyer under Article VIII of this Agreement; (iii) Transfer Taxes; (iv)
Sellers liability under this Agreement for fees of the Escrow Agent, the
Accountant, any arbitrator or Sellers counsel; (v) claims of Buyer for
payment of a negative Shareholders Equity Adjustment as determined in
accordance with Section 2.2(b); or (vi) claims of Buyer for payment of a

of a corporation listed on a national securities exchange, electronic
quotation and trading system or traded in the over-the-counter market with
which Seller has no other affiliation. For purposes of this Section 12.1, (i)
" _Seller Restricted Period_ " shall mean the period from and after the
Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; and (ii) "
_Restricted Business_ " shall mean (x) multi-peril crop insurance, crop hail
insurance, livestock risk protection coverage or any other agricultural
insurance or agricultural reinsurance product underwritten by Buyer, the
Companies or any of their respective divisions, subsidiaries or affiliates as
an insurer or reinsurer in the United States of America as of the date of this
Agreement, and (y) computer hardware or software applications directly or
indirectly

  related to the origination, administration, underwriting, loss reserving,
claims adjusting or claims payment of agricultural insurance or agricultural
reinsurance products.

  

(c) During the Seller Restricted Period, each Seller

  

(i) shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, directly
or indirectly, for or on behalf of himself or any other Person, employ or
solicit for employment any officer, executive or employee of Buyer or any of
Buyers Affiliates or cause or seek to cause any such individual to leave the
employ of Buyer or any of its Affiliates;

 

(ii) shall not, directly or indirectly, seek to encourage, induce or
attempt to induce any customer, agent or vendor of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to cease doing business with, or lessen its business with Buyer or
any of Buyers Affiliates, or otherwise interfere with or damage (or attempt
to interfere with or damage) any of Buyer\'s or its Affiliates relationships
with their customers, agents and vendors; and

 

(iii) shall not, without prior approval of Buyer to act on its behalf,
use proprietary business customer information related to Buyer or any Company.

 

(d) The Employee Sellers shall be subject to the restrictive
covenants contained in their respective Employee Seller Employment Agreements.

 

(e) From and after the date of this Agreement, each Seller agrees
that it shall not engage in any conduct that involves the making or publishing
of written or oral statements or remarks (including the repetition or
distribution of derogatory rumors, allegations, negative reports or comments)
which are disparaging, deleterious or damaging to the integrity, reputation or
goodwill of the Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or any
of their respective officers, directors or current employees or their
operation of the Companies business. From and after the date of this
Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates
and the officers, directors and current employees of it and its affiliates
not to, engage in any conduct that involves the making or publishing of
written or oral statements or remarks (including the repetition or
distribution of derogatory rumors, allegations, negative reports or comments)
which are disparaging, deleterious or damaging to the integrity, reputation or
goodwill of Sellers. Buyer agrees to be responsible for any breach or
violation of the requirements of this Section 12.1(e), as it applies to its
Affiliates and the officers, directors and current employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent any Seller or Buyer from making any such comments that are
specifically related to asserting its claims or defending itself against
claims filed with the body exercising arbitration or similar quasi-judicial
authority or power, or defending itself against claims made by any other
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be.

 

(f) During the period from and after the date of this Agreement
until October 24, 2008 (" _Buyer Restricted Period_ "), neither Buyer nor its
representatives (including Buyers directors, officers, employees, agents,
consultants and advisors) shall employ or solicit for employment any Person
who was employed by the Companies as of the commencement of the Buyer
Restricted Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 12.1(f) shall
not prohibit Buyer

  from (i) recruiting through general solicitations posted in newspapers, trade
journals or on the Internet or (ii) soliciting for employment any Person who
is no longer an employee of the Companies.

 

Section 12.2. _Waivers and Amendments; Non-Contractual Remedies;
Preservation of Remedies_. This Agreement may be amended, superseded,
canceled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a
written instrument signed by each of Buyer, the Companies and Sellers or, in
the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any
right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.  Subject to Article X,
the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in
equity.

 

Section 12.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Escrow
Agreement and the Employee Seller Employment Agreements) constitutes the
entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof including, but not limited to, the Confidentiality Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon execution of this Agreement and
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the Escrow Agreement and
Employee Seller Employment Agreements) shall supersede the rights and
obligations of the parties thereunder with respect to any confidential
information which may have been exchanged prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 12.4. _Interpretation_. (a) The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement that are specifically referred to herein are a part of this
Agreement as if fully set forth herein. When reference is made in this
Agreement to any Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference is to a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
inclusion by a party of a matter or item in any Schedule to this Agreement
shall not, for any purpose of this Agreement, be deemed to be the inclusion of
such matter or item in any other Schedule to this Agreement, except to the
extent that such inclusion provides reasonable notice to the other party of
the matter or item disclosed. The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

(b) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof" and
terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be
deemed to refer to the date set forth in the first paragraph of this
Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and other words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the singular is used herein, the same shall include the plural, and whenever
the plural is used herein, the same shall include the singular, where
appropriate.

 



  Section 12.5. _Construction_. The parties intend that each
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement and condition
contained herein will have independent significance. If any party has breached
or violated or not fulfilled, or if there is an inaccuracy in, any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement or condition
contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement or condition
relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of
specificity) that the party has not breached or violated, has fulfilled or in
respect of which there is not an inaccuracy, will not detract from or mitigate
the fact that the party has breached or violated, not fulfilled or there is
an inaccuracy in, the other representation, warranty, covenant, obligation,
agreement or condition.

 

Section 12.6. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, that provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 

Section 12.7. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing, shall be given by one or more of the following means and
shall be deemed given: (a) when delivered, if delivered in person, (b) upon
confirmation of receipt, if transmitted by facsimile, (c) three (3) Business
Days after mailing, if mailed by certified or registered mail (return receipt
requested), or (d) on the Business Day on which delivered by an express
courier (with confirmation), (or, if not delivered on a Business Day, on the

  Section 12.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries; Binding Effect_. Except as
provided in Article X, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon any Person, including any employee of any Company,
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or
any part hereof. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with this Agreement
without notice or Liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by Sellers without the prior written consent of Buyer, or by Buyer
without the prior written consent of Sellers, except that before or after the
Closing, Buyer shall have the right, without such consent, to assign to a
Subsidiary of Buyer its rights and obligations under this Agreement;
_provided_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Facsimile copies of original signatures shall be effective
as original signatures.

 

Section 12.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, it being
understood that all of the parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

Section 12.10. _Dispute Resolution_. Any and all disputes between the
parties with respect to any claim or matter arising out of this Agreement,
including but not limited to any claim arising pursuant to Section 10.2 or the
Escrow Agreement, that the parties are unable to resolve after the exercise of
reasonable efforts to resolve them informally, shall be resolved by binding
arbitration proceedings and such dispute shall be resolved and settled by
arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Section 1 et
seq.) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association and following the laws of the State of New York. The
decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and
judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof in the State of New York. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall
not be authorized to award punitive damages. The arbitration shall take place
in the City of Kansas City, Missouri. Each party shall bear its respective
costs related to arbitration, and the fees of the arbitrator shall be borne
equally by Buyer (50%) and Sellers (50%) and allocated among Sellers as
specified in the Seller Allocation Notice.

 

Section 12.11. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED,

  Section 12.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 12.13. _No Strict Construction Against the Drafter_. The parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by all parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
