Section 2.02 _The Purchase Price_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the aggregate purchase price is: (i) One Hundred and Eighty-

without duplication of amounts otherwise included in clause (vii), decreased
by the amount, if any, of Excess Change of Control Costs (as defined below);
and (ix) decreased by the amount, if any, for which the Selling Shareholder
has not provided payment or indemnity pursuant to Section 2.02(h) (the net of
such amounts (i) through (ix) being the " _Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase
Price shall be further adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02(j) hereof.



(i) The term " _Working Capital_ " as used herein shall mean the sum of the

practice and consistent with the principles and procedures used in the
calculation on Schedule 2.02(a).



(ii) The term " _Base Working Capital_ " as used herein means the amount shown
on Schedule 2.02(a) as "Base Working Capital". The Working Capital as of the



 

2 Closing shall be calculated in the same manner as the Working Capital was
calculated as illustrated in Schedule 2.02(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the following shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating Working
Capital: (1) any item or account entry used to determine Working Capital that
is reclassified either into or out of current assets or current liabilities
in a manner that is a different classification from that used to calculate
Base Working Capital (for example, a reclassification of the federal income
tax refund amount from current asset to long-term or other assets due solely
to a change in expected timing of receipt); (2) any intercompany accounts; (3)
any effect of any outstanding mark-to-market position of a Risk Management
Instrument (as defined below); (4) any current assets to the extent
relating to, or arising out of, the disposition of, or casualty loss to, any
non-current asset; and (5) use of cash and cash equivalents to effect
reductions in long-term debt or redeemable preferred stock but only to the
extent that Purchaser shall have consented to the use of current assets to
effect such reductions (it being agreed that scheduled principal amortization
under the Credit Agreement through Closing shall be counted as reductions to
Working Capital in any event).



(iii) The " _Stranded Cost Appeal Recovery_ " shall mean the aggregate amount
recoverable by the Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined below) as a result
of a Final Order (as defined in Section 7.01(d) hereof) with respect to

(1) an amount which is an amount determined by multiplying the amount of the
Stranded Cost Appeal Recovery (up to an amount equal to the aggregate
Preferred Stock Accrual for the period from January 1, 2005 through the
Closing Date) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Preferred Stock
Adjustment and the denominator of which is the Preferred Stock Accrual for
the period from January 1, 2005 through the Closing Date;



(2) fifty percent (50%) of the next $10,000,000 of Stranded Cost Appeal
Recovery (in excess of the Preferred Stock Accrual from January 1, 2005

affect the Stranded Cost Appeal Recovery Adjustment and shall be for the sole
benefit of Purchaser.



(iv) The " _Preferred Stock Accrual_ " shall mean with respect to the Series C
Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock the sum of (x) dividends
accrued but not paid in cash or by the issuance of additional shares of Senior

paid by the issuance of additional shares of Senior Preferred Stock with
respect to the dividends described in clause (x) above, and (z) increases in

with respect to the period after December 31, 2004 through and including the

3 The " _Preferred Stock Adjustment_ " shall initially be $0.00 and shall be
further determined as follows:



(1) increased by the Preferred Stock Accrual for the period from January 1,
2005 through the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or March 31, 2005;



(2) increased by fifty percent (50%) of the Preferred Stock Accrual for the
period from March 31, 2005 through the earlier to occur of the Closing Date
or June 30, 2005; and



(3) unaffected by the Preferred Stock Accrual for any periods after the
earlier to occur of the Closing Date or June 30, 2005.



(v) " _Company Transaction Costs_ " means the liabilities or obligations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the payments of the fees and
expenses of financial advisors, counsel, independent accountants or other

the extent such liabilities or obligations exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate

with such individual, in each case as and to the extent either (A) paid at or
prior to Closing or (B) accrued or accruable as a liability on the books of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of Closing (the amounts referenced in this
clause (i) being called the " _Closing Change of Control Costs_ "), and (ii)
all liabilities and obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
Specified Employment Agreements other than Closing Change of Control Costs
that are triggered in part because a "Change of Control", a "termination
without cause" or a termination of employment by the employee with "good
reason" shall have occurred in consequence of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or the Closing and/or staffing or other
decisions made by the Company at the direction of Purchaser from and after
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), as to
such individual listed in Section 3.25 of the Selling Stockholder Disclosure
Schedule, the Excess Change of Control Cost associated with such individual
shall only be payments, liabilities and/or obligations in an amount exceeding

Closing and taken into account in calculating Working Capital as of the
Closing Date.



(b) The Purchase Price shall be comprised of (i) a cash amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the Purchase Price and (ii) a number of shares of common
stock, no par value, of Purchaser (" _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") determined by
dividing fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price by the Per Share Amount.
The " _Per Share Amount_ " shall mean $20.20 and shall be subject to
appropriate adjustment after the date hereof only in the event of any stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar event or transaction

(c) The Purchase Price payable at the Closing (the " _Estimated Purchase
Price_ ") shall consist of the sum of (i) the Equity Value, (ii) increased by
the amount, if any, by which the estimated Working Capital exceeds the Base
Working Capital, (iii) decreased by the amount, if any, by which the
estimated Working Capital is less than the Base Working Capital, (iv)

the amount, if any, of estimated aggregate Excess Change of Control Costs.
Not later than five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Purchaser a written statement of the chief financial officer of the
Company setting forth the Estimated Purchase Price, with the calculation of
the Estimated Purchase Price shown in reasonable detail based on information
then available to the Company.



(d) Promptly following the Closing Date, but in no event later than 45 days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide to the Selling Shareholder
a certificate executed on behalf of Purchaser by the Chief Accounting Officer
of Purchaser, dated the date of its delivery, setting forth the relevant
calculations resulting in the final Purchase Price (the " _Proposed Final
Purchase Price Statement_ "). The Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with past
practice and consistent with the calculation on Schedule 2.02(a).



(e) Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation to, and shall cause
the Company and its employees and agents to provide reasonable cooperation
to, the Selling Shareholder and its representatives in their review of the
Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement and shall provide the Selling
Shareholder and its representatives reasonable access to the applicable
personnel, properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for such purpose. In the event the Selling Shareholder disputes the
correctness of the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement proposed by
Purchaser, the Selling Shareholder shall notify Purchaser in writing of its
objections within 15 days after receipt of the Proposed Final Purchase Price
Statement and shall set forth, in writing and in reasonable detail,
the reasons for the Selling



 

5 Shareholders objections. If the Selling Shareholder fails to deliver its
notice of objections within 15 days after receipt of the Proposed Final
Purchase Price Statement, the Selling Shareholder shall be deemed to have
accepted Purchasers calculation. The Selling Shareholder and Purchaser shall
endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed matters within 15 days after
receipt of the Selling Shareholders notice of objections. If the Selling
Shareholder and Purchaser are unable to resolve the disputed matters, the
Selling Shareholder and Purchaser shall promptly refer the disputed matters to
a nationally recognized "big-four" accounting firm acceptable to the Selling
Shareholder and to Purchaser (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm
shall offer the Selling Shareholder and Purchaser (and their
respective representatives) the opportunity to provide written submissions
regarding their positions on the disputed matters, which opportunity shall not
extend more than 15 days after the submission of the disputed matters to the
Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall deliver a written report resolving
all disputed matters and setting forth the basis for such resolution within 30
days after the Selling Shareholder and Purchaser have submitted in writing (or
have had the opportunity to submit in writing but have not submitted) their
positions as to the disputed items. The determination of the Accounting Firm
in respect of the correctness of each matter remaining in dispute shall be
conclusive and binding on the Selling Shareholder and Purchaser. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be based solely on the written
submissions by the Selling Shareholder and Purchaser and shall not be by
independent review (it being understood that the Accounting Firm need not
accept in its entirety the submission of either one party or the other). The
final Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.02(e)
(whether by failure of the Selling Shareholder to deliver a timely notice of
objection, by agreement of the Selling Shareholder and Purchaser or by
determination of the Accounting Firm), is referred to herein as the " _Final
Purchase Price_ ".



(f) In the event the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Purchase Price paid at the Closing by Purchaser, then Purchaser shall
promptly (within five business days of the determination of the Final
Purchase Price) pay to the Selling Shareholder an amount in cash equal to the
difference between the Final Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price.
In the event the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase
Price paid at the Closing by Purchaser, then the Selling Shareholder shall
promptly (within five business days of the determination of the Final Purchase
Price) pay to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the difference between the
Estimated Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price.



(g) The fees and expenses, if any, of the Accounting Firm retained in
accordance with this Section 2.02 to resolve any dispute shall be paid one-
half by Purchaser and one-half by the Selling Shareholder.

 



(h) The Selling Shareholder shall be solely responsible for, and
hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Purchaser, the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries against any and all liabilities, obligations and Losses
in any manner arising out of, or associated with (i) the employment agreement
listed on Schedule 2.02(h) of the Selling Shareholder Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Designated Employment Agreement_ "), (ii) all liabilities and
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Designated
Employment Agreement that are triggered in part because a "Change of
Control", a "termination without cause" or a termination of employment by the
related employee with "good reason" shall have occurred in consequence of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or the Closing
and/or



 

6 staffing or other decisions made by the Company at the direction of Purchaser
from and after Closing, and (iii) (A) all costs and expenses reasonably
incurred by Purchaser, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries in
defending and/or settling claims brought by the related employee under and in
respect of the Designated Employment Agreement and (B) any and all additional
amounts that become due or payable in consequence of indemnity and similar
gross-up payments in respect of excise taxes and/or income or similar taxes
and impositions pursuant to the terms of the applicable Designated
Employment Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , there shall be excluded from
the Selling Shareholders obligations under this Section 2.02(h) fifty percent
(50%) of the first $2,734,100 in payments that would be due under this Section
2.02(h) but for this _proviso_ (with the Company remaining obligated to pay,
for its own account, and without right to reimbursement or indemnification,
fifty percent (50%) of the first $2,734,100 in payments that would be due from
the Selling Shareholder under this Section 2.02(h) but for this _proviso_ ).



(i) In the event the Accounting Firm is requested to resolve any dispute
pursuant to this Section 2.02, any meetings or proceedings involving the
Accounting Firm in connection with such dispute resolution shall be held in
New York, New York.

 



(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchase Price shall be
further adjusted as follows: (i) _increased_ by the amount, if any, of the
Stranded Cost Appeal Recovery Adjustment to the extent the Stranded Cost
Appeal Recovery, if any, is determined after the Closing Date; and (ii)
_decreased_ by the amount of any Excess Change of Control Costs and any
payments or indemnification that have not been paid by the Selling Shareholder
under Section 2.02(h), in each case, to the extent not already reflected in
the adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.02. Any such
adjustment shall be paid by Purchaser or by the Selling Shareholder, as the
case may be (after appropriate netting and offset), in cash within five
business days of the determination thereof.



(k) Commencing September 30, 2004 and on or before the thirtieth day of
each succeeding calendar month ending immediately prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall provide Purchaser with a reasonably detailed monthly status
report (in a format to be agreed by the parties) tracking changes in the
principal components that may result in adjustments in the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 2.02. The monthly status report shall include an
accounts receivable aging schedule, an accounts receivable roll forward
schedule and a schedule showing bad debt expense calculation and a bad debt
accrual calculation (including a statement of assumptions underlying the
calculation).



(l) For so long as the Selling Shareholder shall have an obligation under
Section 2.02(f), Section 2.02(g) or Section 2.02(h), the Selling
Shareholder shall have and retain unrestricted cash in an amount equal to its
maximum possible exposure (the " _Full Exposure_ ") under Sections 2.02(f),
2.02(g) and 2.02(h) as such Full Exposure have been reasonably estimated and
agreed by the parties prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchaser shall accept a letter of credit (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser) in an amount equal to the Full Exposure
and the Selling Shareholder shall not be required to comply with this Section
2.02(l).

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLING SHAREHOLDER_



The disclosure schedule delivered by the Selling Shareholder to Purchaser
on or before the date of this Agreement (the " _Selling Shareholder
Disclosure Schedule_ ") shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the
numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III and the
disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify other paragraphs in this Article
III, if any, to the extent such disclosure is reasonably determinable to be
applicable to such other paragraphs.



The Selling Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as
follows:



Section 3.01 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has full corporate power and authority to
conduct its business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use and
lease its assets and properties, except for such failures to be so
incorporated, existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority which, individually or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The
Company is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, use or leasing of its
assets and properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for such failures to
be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing which, individually
or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Selling Shareholder has previously delivered or
made available to Purchaser correct and complete copies of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable charter documents) or
partnership or limited liability company agreement (as applicable, the "
_Governing Instrument_ " of such person) of the Company and each of the
Companys Subsidiaries.



Section 3.02 _Capital Stock_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company

14 1/2 % Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series D, $1,000 Liquidation
Preference, of which 171,503 shares are outstanding on the date hereof (the "

30, 2004 and through the date hereof, there has been no change in the number
of issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock or shares of Company Stock
held in treasury or reserved for issuance. All of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. The Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred
Stock are the only outstanding Company Preferred Stock. Section 3.02(a) of the
Selling Shareholder Disclosure Schedule shows (i) the aggregate number of
Company Preferred Stock payable as in-kind dividends on the Company Preferred
Stock on each of October 1, 2004, April 1, 2005 and

any kind (each, a " _Lien_ "). There are no (i) outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, rights (including "phantom" stock rights), preemptive
rights or other contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements,
including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security,
instrument or agreement (together, " _Options_ ") obligating the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or to
grant, extend or enter into any such Option or (ii) voting trusts or other
commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements in favor of any
person with respect to the voting of or the right to participate in dividends
or other earnings on any capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.



(c) There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of Company Stock or any capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company
or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other
person, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.

delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Selling Shareholder and the
consummation by the Selling Shareholder of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly approved by all necessary partnership or
other action and no other proceedings on the part of the Selling Shareholder
or its partners are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Selling Shareholder and the consummation
by the Selling Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 3.04 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Selling Shareholder and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Selling Shareholder, enforceable against the Selling
Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity relating
to enforceability (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or
in equity).



 

9 Section 3.05 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.05 of the Selling
Shareholder Disclosure Schedule, there are no legal actions, suits,
proceedings, claims, complaints, disputes or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of the Selling Shareholder, threatened, at law, in equity, in
arbitration or before any Governmental or Regulatory Authority (as defined
below) against the Selling Shareholder which would, if adversely determined,
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Selling Shareholder to
perform its obligations under this Agreement. No injunction, writ, temporary
restraining order, decree or order of any nature has been issued by any court
or other Governmental or Regulatory Authority against the Selling Shareholder
purporting to enjoin or restrain the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement.



Section 3.06 _Authorization; No Contravention_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Selling Shareholder of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby do not violate, conflict with or result in any breach or
contravention of or the creation of any Lien under any Contract (as defined
below) to which the Selling Shareholder is a party or any law (as defined
below) applicable to the Selling Shareholder. The Selling Shareholder has not
previously entered into any agreement which is currently in effect or to
which the Selling Shareholder is currently bound, granting any rights to any
Person which are inconsistent with the rights to be granted by the Selling
Shareholder herein.

or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture or other business association or entity (other than
non-controlling investments in the ordinary course of business). Each of the
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has full power and authority
to conduct its business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use
and lease its assets and properties, except for such failures to be so
organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority
which, individually or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Subsidiaries is duly
qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership, use or leasing of its assets and
properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for such failures to
be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing which, individually
or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

disclosed in Section 3.08(a) of the Selling Shareholder Disclosure Schedule,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Selling Shareholder do
not, and the performance by the Selling Shareholder of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by it of the transactions



 

10 contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, result in a violation or breach
of, constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under, result in or give to any person any right of payment or reimbursement
under or termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of, or result
in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the assets or
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,

or any of their respective assets or properties, or (y) any note, bond,
mortgage, security agreement, indenture, license, franchise, permit,
concession, contract, lease or other instrument, obligation, rate, rate
schedule, tariff, utility service agreement or like document filed with or
approved by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority, or agreement or

Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties is
bound, excluding from the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, modifications,

(L) make any capital expenditures or commitments for additions to plant,
property or equipment constituting capital assets, except (1) as may be
required by any law, (2) as reasonably deemed necessary by the Company to

in 2004, the Company and its Subsidiaries may make or authorize capital
expenditures in excess of such capital budget and in excess of the per project
amounts budgeted



 

31 therein so long as such capital expenditures neither (x) cause or would be
reasonably likely to cause capital expenditures for 2004 to exceed the
aggregate 2004 capital budget by more than $2,500,000 in the aggregate nor (y)
exceed the budget specified for any individual project contemplated by the
2004 capital budget by more than $250,000 (or exceed $1,000,000 in total for
any project not contemplated by the 2004 capital budget) and (II) in 2005, the
Company and its subsidiaries may make or authorize aggregate capital
expenditures in an amount not to exceed $40,000,000;



(M) make any change in the lines of business in which it participates or is

material agreements or modifications of (i) material existing agreements with

Transaction, and shall promptly advise Purchaser, orally and in writing, of
any change or event having, or which, insofar as can be reasonably foreseen,
could have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that the Company
shall not be required to make any disclosure to the extent such disclosure
would constitute a violation of any applicable law. The Company shall provide
Purchaser with copies of all amendments to the Credit Agreement or any other
Listed Agreement to the extent providing such copies would not constitute a
violation of applicable law or contractual confidentiality obligations.



(d) _2004/2005 Budgets_. Attached as Schedule 5.01(d) to the Selling
Shareholder Disclosure Schedule are certain forecasts of the capital budgets

on the proposed Company Budget for 2005 prior to approval by the Companys
Board of Directors.



Section 5.02 _No Solicitations_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Selling
Shareholder agrees (a) that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
and it shall use its best efforts to cause their respective Representatives
(as defined below) not to, initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or
indirectly, any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or
offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its
shareholders) with respect to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
acquisition or similar transaction (including, without limitation, a tender
or exchange offer) involving the purchase of (i) all or any significant
portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
(ii) 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (iii)
10% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of any Subsidiary of the
Company owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (any such proposal or
offer being hereinafter referred to as an " _Alternate Proposal_ "), or engage
in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or
data to, or have any discussions with, any person or group relating to an
Alternate Proposal (excluding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement an Alternate Proposal; (b) that it will immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties with respect to any of the foregoing, and it will take the necessary
steps to inform such parties of its obligations under this Section; and (c)
that it will notify Purchaser immediately if any such inquiries, proposals or
offers are received by, any such information requested from, or any
such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued
with, it or any of such persons or groups.

of this Agreement through the Closing Date, neither the Selling Shareholder
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any
material provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it
is a party or in respect of which it is a primary, intended beneficiary.
During such period, the Selling Shareholder shall enforce, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including, but not limited to, by obtaining injunctions to prevent any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction.

reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, and to all

(b) Any such information or material obtained pursuant to this Section 6.01
shall constitute "Evaluation Material" (as such term is defined in the

and Purchaser, among others, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and
Purchaser hereby agrees to be bound by the terms, provisions and obligations
of the Confidentiality Agreement.



(c) No information or material provided pursuant to this Section 6.01, nor any
investigation or analysis by Purchaser or any of its Representatives pursuant
to this Section 6.01 shall affect any representations or warranties of the
parties herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties.



Section 6.02 _Regulatory and Other Third Party Approvals_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Selling Shareholder
and Purchaser will proceed diligently and in good faith to, as promptly as
practicable, (i) obtain all consents, approvals or actions of, make all
filings with and give all notices to Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or
any other third parties required of Purchaser, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and the other
matters contemplated hereby, including obtaining the approval of, or a public
interest determination by, the PUCT under Texas law, to the extent required
by the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, and the approval of the NMPRC
under New Mexico law, to the extent required by the New Mexico Public Utility
Act, and complying with the filing and approval requirements of the FERC
under the Power Act, the SEC under PUHCA (including under section 9(a)(2)),

34  will (x) take promptly all actions necessary to make the filings required of
Purchaser and the Company or their respective affiliates under the HSR Act,
(y) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional
information received by such party or its affiliates from the Federal Trade

cooperate with the other parties in connection with such other parties
filings under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any investigation
or other inquiry concerning the Agreement or the other matters contemplated
by this Agreement commenced by either the FTC or the Antitrust Division or

Section 6.03 _ERISA; Employment Matters_. (a) Although the Purchaser, the
Company or its Subsidiaries have no obligation to continue the employment of
any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (a " _Transferred Employee_ ")
after the Closing, from and after the Closing Date until the first anniversary
thereof, the Purchaser shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to provide
each Transferred Employee who is actively employed by the Purchaser, the
Company or their Subsidiaries with salary and employee benefits, including
eligibility for retirement and health/welfare benefits, that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such individuals prior to the Closing Date.



(b) With respect to any group health care plan or program of Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries in which a Transferred Employee becomes eligible to
participate as of the Closing Date, such Transferred Employee shall (i)
receive credit for any deductibles, co-pays or other out-of-pocket expenses
paid under the corresponding group health care plan or program of the Company
or its Subsidiaries and (ii) not be subject to any pre-existing condition
limitations to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitation did not
apply to such Transferred Employee under the corresponding group health plan
or program of the Company or its Subsidiaries. 



(c) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall recognize all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries rendered by a Transferred Employee as if it were
service with Purchaser for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any plan
or program of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in which such Transferred
Employee becomes eligible to participate. Transferred Employees will not
receive service credit for purposes of benefit accrual (i.e., for purposes of
determining the accrued benefit under a defined benefit pension plan or for
purposes of determining the amount of a participants account under a defined
contribution plan) under the Purchasers plans and programs since the
Transferred Employees are entitled to benefits under the Company Employee
Benefit Plans for such periods of service. 



(d) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to honor, pay and perform all of its covenants and obligations
under, and in accordance with the existing terms of, all employment,
severance, termination and similar agreements between the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee thereof that are listed on
Section 3.17(a) of the Selling Shareholder Disclosure Schedule.



(e) During the sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not
cause or allow the Company or any Subsidiary to take any action or series of
actions with respect to employees of the Company which action, or series of
actions, would constitute either a "Plant  



 

35  Closing" or "Mass Layoff" under the Worker Adjustment Retraining
Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et seq. and/or any applicable
state law governing layoff notification.



(f) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, the Selling
Shareholder shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to work in good faith
with the Purchaser, at Purchasers cost, to develop retention or other benefit
programs that are reasonably requested by the Purchaser. Any such retention
and other benefits programs implemented shall not be considered to be in
effect for any purpose under any other provision of this Agreement, including
but not limited to, the representations in Article III hereof and the
calculation of the Purchase Price in Article II hereof.



(g) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, (i) the
Selling Shareholder shall cause the Company to cooperate with Purchaser to
prepare and distribute materials to, and otherwise communicate with the
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding employee retention and
employment opportunities with the Purchaser, the Company or their Subsidiaries
following Closing and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
Selling Shareholder shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to make the
personnel records of the Company and its Subsidiaries available to the
Purchaser.



(h) Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall preclude the Purchaser, the Company or
their Subsidiaries from (i) amending or terminating any Company
Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) merging any Company Employee Benefit Plan with or
into any benefit plan or program sponsored by the Purchaser or (iii)
terminating the employment of any Transferred Employee, following the Closing
Date.



Section 6.04 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
From and after the Closing Date and until the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date and for so long thereafter as any claim for indemnification
asserted on or prior to such date has not been fully adjudicated, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries
to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), liabilities, judgments and
settlement amounts that are paid or incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Closing Date) that is based on, or arises out of, the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer or agent of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and relates to or arises out of any action or
omission occurring at or prior to the Closing Date ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based on,
or arising out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent a corporation is
permitted under applicable law to indemnify its own directors or officers, as
the case may be; _provided_ that the Purchaser or the Company, as the case may
be, shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its
written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any
Indemnified Party (whether arising prior to or after the Closing Date), each
of the parties agrees that (w) the Purchaser will or shall cause the Company
to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation to  



 

36  each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by applicable law;
_provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides any
undertaking required by applicable law to repay such advance if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification; (x)
the Indemnified Parties shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser; (y) the Purchaser shall or shall cause the Company to pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
(subject to the final sentence of this paragraph) promptly as statements
therefor are received; and (z) the Purchaser shall or shall cause the Company
to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any
such matter. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall notify the Purchaser, but the failure so to notify
the Purchaser shall not relieve the Purchaser from any liability which it may
have under this paragraph except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the Purchaser. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only
one law firm to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there
is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties in which case, the Indemnified Parties may retain more than one law
firm.



(b) Except to the extent required by law, until the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser will not take and shall cause the Company not to take
any action so as to amend, modify, limit or repeal the provisions for
indemnification of Indemnified Parties contained in the certificates or
articles of incorporation or bylaws (or other comparable charter documents) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (which as of the Closing Date shall be no
more favorable to such individuals than those maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries on the date hereof) in such a manner as would adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to be indemnified by such
corporations in respect of their serving in such capacities prior to the
Closing Date.



(c) For a period of four years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause
the Company to maintain in effect policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by Company as of the date hereof; _provided_
that there may be substituted therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms that are no less advantageous with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent such liability
insurance can be maintained annually at a cost to the Company not greater than
300 percent of the current annual premiums for such directors and officers
liability insurance, which existing premium costs are set forth in Section
6.04(c) of the Selling Shareholder Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _further_
, that if such insurance cannot be so maintained or obtained at such cost, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain or obtain as much of such insurance as
can be so maintained or obtained at a cost equal to 300 percent of the current
annual premiums of Company for its directors and officers liability
insurance.

 



(d) The provisions of this Section are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each party entitled to
insurance coverage under paragraph (c) above, respectively, and his or her
heirs and legal representatives, and shall be in addition to, and shall not
impair, any other rights an Indemnified Party may have under the certificate
or articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, under the Business Corporation Act of the State of Texas or
otherwise.



 

37 Section 6.05 _Transfer Taxes; Filings_. The Company shall pay any Tax on gains
derived from real property transfers, any real estate transfer Tax, any real
property transfer Tax, any stock transfer Tax, any sales, use and value added
Taxes, and any other transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any
similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ ")
imposed by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority (and any penalties and
interest with respect to such Taxes), which become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Selling Shareholder and
Purchaser shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of any
required returns with respect to such Taxes and in the determination of the
portion of the consideration allocable to real property of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in any jurisdiction, and Purchaser shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any Transfer Taxes that are
required or permitted to be filed on or before the Closing Date.



Section 6.06 _Notifications_. Promptly after obtaining knowledge thereof, the
Selling Shareholder shall notify Purchaser, and Purchaser shall notify the
Selling Shareholder, as applicable, in writing of (a) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any fact or event which causes or would cause (i) any
representation or warranty of the Selling Shareholder or Purchaser, as
applicable, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Closing Date or (ii)
any covenant, condition or agreement of the Selling Shareholder or Purchaser,
as applicable, in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in any
material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Closing Date, and (b)
any failure by the Selling Shareholder or Purchaser, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by the Selling Shareholder or Purchaser, as applicable,
hereunder in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the
Closing Date. In addition, promptly after obtaining knowledge thereof, the
Selling Shareholder shall notify Purchaser in writing of the taking by the
Company of any action to terminate the employment of any of the senior
officers or provide any of such senior officers with "good reason" to
terminate employment. No notice given pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall
have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any
condition contained herein.



Section 6.07 _Change of Control Provisions_. (a) The Transaction
will constitute a "Change of Control" within the meaning of the Statement of
Resolution. In connection with such Change of Control, Purchaser shall cause
the Company to make the "Change of Control Offer" required by paragraph
(g)(i) of the Statement of Resolution; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the
event that on the Closing Date, Purchaser causes the Company to issue a notice
of redemption with respect to an available option to redeem the Series D
Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph (e)(i)(A) or (e)(i)(C) of the Statement
of Resolution, then Purchaser shall not be requested to initiate such a
"Change of Control Offer".

of the Companys indenture with The Bank of New York dated as of April 7,
2000 (as amended, the " _Indenture_ ") relating to the Companys 10.25% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2010, Series B (the " _10.25% Notes_ "). In connection
with such Change of Control, Purchaser shall cause the Company to make the
"Change of Control Offer" required by section 4.16 of the Indenture;
_provided_ , that, in the event that on the Closing Date, Purchaser causes the
Company to issue a  



 

38  notice of redemption with respect to an available option to redeem the
10.25% Notes pursuant to paragraph 6(a) of such notes, then Purchaser shall
not be required to initiate such a "Change of Control Offer."



(c) The Transaction will constitute an "Event of Default" under Section 7(k)
of the Credit Agreement. In connection with the consummation of the
Transaction, Purchaser will make appropriate arrangements so that,
simultaneously with such consummation, (i) all amounts outstanding under the
Credit Agreement shall have been paid in full or (ii) there will not be an
Event of Default under the Credit Agreement in consequence of the Transaction.

to effect and maintain a registration of the Purchaser Common Stock via a
registration statement in the appropriate form so that transfers thereof can
be effected by the holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the
methods of distribution set forth in such registration statement and the rules
under the Securities Act applicable thereto.



(b) Pending registration of the Purchaser Common Stock compromising part of
the Purchase Price, transfer and exchange of such Purchaser Common Stock
shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Annex A.



Section 6.09 _Lock-Up Agreements_. The partners in Selling Shareholder
identified in Annex B hereto have agreed to enter into lock-up agreements with
respect to Purchaser Common Stock to be held by each such partner and its
affiliates, such lock-up agreements to have the terms and conditions

its Subsidiaries shall initiate a general rate case in any jurisdiction in
which it does business without first consulting with Purchaser and obtaining

any of its Subsidiaries shall propose or make any changes in rates or charges,
standards of service or accounting from those each has in effect on the date
hereof without first consulting with and obtaining the approval of the

Docket No. 473-04-2459 (the " _Stranded Cost Proceeding_ "), the Company and
