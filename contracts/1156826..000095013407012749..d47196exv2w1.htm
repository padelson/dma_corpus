    ##### 

  

     

 (c) If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary or Foreign Subsidiary receives a written Acquisition Proposal which has not been initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of this Section 7.04, and which the Company Board or a special committee thereof (a " _Special Committee_ ") has determined in good faith following consultation with its legal and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company, its U.S. Subsidiaries and its Foreign Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives thereafter may (i) furnish, make available or provide access to non-public information with respect to the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries and Foreign Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and such Persons Representatives ( _provided_ that the Company (A) has previously or concurrently furnished, made available or provided access to such non-public information to Parent and (B) shall furnish, make available or provide access to such non-public information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with such Person which is at least as favorable to the Company as the Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) participate in negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) disclose to the Company Shareholders any information required to be disclosed under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of this clause (iii) such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation if not accompanied by an express public re-affirmation of the Company Recommendation and the Operating Trust Recommendation. From and after the date of this Agreement, in the event the Company or any of its Representatives receives from a Person or group of related Persons (i) an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or any U.S. Subsidiaries or Foreign Subsidiaries (other than requests for information unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal) or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of (but in no event more than twenty-four hours following) such receipt. Such notification shall include, to the extent then known, the identity of the parties and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request or, if not made in writing, a written description thereof. The Company shall keep Parent apprised as to the status and any material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning the same on a current basis (and in any event no later than twenty-four hours after the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations). Neither the Company nor any U.S. Subsidiary of Foreign Subsidiary shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality agreement that would prohibit it from providing such information to Parent. 

   

 (d) At any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, upon receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board or a Special Committee may after consultation with its legal and financial advisors recommend that the Company Shareholders approve such Superior Proposal, which recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation, and may authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement and enter into an agreement relating to, or for the implementation of, such Superior Proposal provided the Company has first complied with Section 9.01(h). 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Section 7.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board or a Special Committee from (i) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, effecting a Change in Recommendation if the Company Board or a Special Committee determines in good faith, 

    ##### 

  

    

after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties to the
Company Shareholders under applicable Law or (ii) taking and disclosing to
the Company Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or from making any required disclosure to the Company
Shareholders under applicable Law, including Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation if
not accompanied by an express public re-affirmation of the Company
Recommendation and the Operating Trust Recommendation; _provided_ , _further_
, that none of the Company, the Company Board or a Special Committee shall be
permitted to recommend that the Company Shareholders tender any securities in
connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation or the Operating Trust Recommendation, unless in each case
such tender or exchange offer constitutes a Superior Proposal and in
connection therewith, effects a Change in Recommendation. 

   

 (f) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the restrictions contained in Article II of the Company Articles or otherwise cause any of such restrictions not to apply unless such actions are taken in connection with a termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(g). 

   

 Section 7.05 Employee Benefits Matters. 

  

 (a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor in accordance with their terms all severance, change-of-control and similar obligations of the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries and Foreign Subsidiaries, and Parent shall pay on the Closing Date to any applicable officer or employee of the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary or Foreign Subsidiary any amounts that such officers or employees are entitled to receive on the Closing Date under such agreements. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor in accordance with their terms any other employment related contracts, agreements arrangements and commitments of the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries and the Foreign Subsidiaries, including the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan, in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary or any of their predecessors. 

   

 (b) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, with respect to each employee of the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary (other than any such employees who are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements) who remains an employee of the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide the Continuing Employees with (i) (A) base salary in an amount at least equal to the base salary that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and (B) cash incentive compensation opportunities (excluding any payments related to equity or equity-based awards) in an attainable amount at least equal to the attainable amount such Continuing Employee was eligible to receive immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding the cash value of any 

    ##### 

  

    

equity-based award or benefits), that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that neither Parent
nor the Surviving Entity nor any of their subsidiaries shall have any
obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the
issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation
rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any
entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares
pursuant to the immediately foregoing sentence; and _provided, further_ ,

providing for such issuance shall be taken into account in determining
whether employee benefits are no less favorable in the aggregate. 

   

 (c) Each Continuing Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries and Foreign Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date under any new parallel employee benefit plan of Parent or its subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee become entitled to participate to the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under the respective Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits and except with respect to benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan). In addition, with respect to any such health benefit plan in which the Continuing Employee become entitled to participate during the calendar year that includes the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for amounts paid by the employee under the respective Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company Common Shares or options to acquire Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the Mergers shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16. 

   

 (e) Prior to the Operating Trust Merger Effective Time, the Company Board shall take such actions as are necessary to terminate the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan and all other share or investment-based non-qualified deferred compensation account-based arrangements (collectively: "Non-Qualified Account Plans"), in a manner that is compliant with Section 409A of the Code. Such action shall be contingent upon, and effective as of, the Company Merger Effective Time. Payment of amounts deferred under the Non-Qualified Account Plans shall be made in cash to the participants in the Non-Qualified Account Plans in a single lump-sum payment by the Surviving Corporation on the first Business Day following January 1, 2008; provided, however, that payments under the Non-Qualified Account Plans will be made immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time if the parties hereto mutually agree that the making of such payments will not cause participants in the Non-Qualified Account Plans to incur any adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code; provided, further, however, that any payment to any individual who is considered a "specified employee" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i) and shall be delayed to the date 

    ##### 

  

    

six months following such participants separation from service in the event,
and to the extent, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company
Board determines that such delay is necessary to comply with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (f) The Companys Amended and Restated Equity Plan for Outside Trustees and the Long Term Incentive Plan shall be terminated as of the Company Merger Effective Time and no provision other than the payments set forth in Article III hereof shall be made for the continuation of any awards thereunder following the Company Merger Effective Time. 

   

 (g) This Section 7.05 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.05, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.05. 

   

 (h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) prevent the amendment or termination of any Plan or interfere with the right or obligation of the Parent or its Affiliates to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law (including Section 409A of the Code); or (iii) limit the right of the Parent or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at any time. 

   

 Section 7.06 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under any of the Organizational Documents, Company Articles, the Company Bylaws, the Operating Trust Articles, the Operating Trust Bylaws or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar agreements of any of the U.S. Subsidiaries or the Foreign Subsidiaries, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through the Company Merger Effective Time serving as a trustee, director or officer of the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary or the Foreign Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Indemnifiable Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnifiable Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, including all reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to Parents or the Surviving Entitys, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by applicable Law, to repay such Indemnifiable Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such 

    ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified);  _provided_ , _however_
, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any
settlement effected without Parents or the Surviving Entitys written consent
and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for
all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim
except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall
have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. The indemnification
and advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity pursuant to
this Section 7.06(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before
the Company Merger Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including
with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the consideration and approval thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto).
All rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of
the Company or the U.S. Subsidiaries or the Foreign Subsidiaries after the
date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors
and personal and legal representatives. For purposes of this Section 7.06(a):
(x) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or
completed Action, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental
Authority or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith
believes might lead to the institution of any such Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or
other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining
to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a
director or officer of the Company or any of the U.S. Subsidiaries or the
Foreign Subsidiaries, at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time at the
request of the Company or any of the U.S. Subsidiaries or the Foreign
Subsidiaries; and (y) term " _Indemnifiable Expenses_ " means reasonable
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations
(including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript
fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including
on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or
participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to
this Section 7.06(a), including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification has
been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless (i) such
settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim, (ii)
such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto, or (iii) Parent or the
Surviving Entity acknowledges that such Claim is subject to this Section
7.06. 

   

 (b) For a period of six (6) years from the Company Merger Effective Time, the charter and bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving Entity and the U.S. Subsidiaries and the Foreign Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the Company Articles, Company Bylaws, Operating Trust Articles, Operating Trust Bylaws or the applicable organizational documents of the Subsidiaries, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Company Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, were 

    ##### 

  

    

directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries (including
fiduciaries under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)) of the Company or any of its U.S.
Subsidiaries or the Foreign Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be
required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law. 

   

 (c) Parent or the Surviving Entity shall maintain for a period of at least six (6) years, policies of directors and officers liability insurance and employed lawyer liability insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Company Merger Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such policies shall provide for at least $50,000,000 of coverage for directors and officers liability and $5,000,000 for employed lawyer liability and shall contain other terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to the insured persons than the policies maintained by the Company, the Operating Trust, the U.S. Subsidiaries and the Foreign Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. There shall be no gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring before the Company Merger Effective Time; provided, that the aggregate premium payable for such insurance shall not exceed the amount set forth on Schedule 7.06(c) (such amount the "Maximum Premium"). If the Company is unable to obtain the insurance described in the first sentence of this Section 7.06(c) for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, Parent or the Surviving Company shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the preceding, Parent and the Surviving Entity may meet their obligations pursuant to this Section 7.06(c) by purchasing a "tail policy" providing coverage in the amounts specified above and on other terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to the insured persons than the policies maintained by the Company, the Operating Trust, the U.S. Subsidiaries and the Foreign Subsidiaries as of the date hereof such. If Parent or the Surviving Entity purchase a tail policy pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor all obligations thereunder. 

   

 (d) If the Surviving Entity or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Entity, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06. 

   

 (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Entity under this Section 7.06 and the parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to this Section 7.06. 

   

 Section 7.07 Further Action; Reasonable Efforts. 

  

 (a) Except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 7.01, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions, under any applicable antitrust or competition laws, and any other Law with respect to this Agreement and

take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Mergers, and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities with the Company and
the U.S. Subsidiaries and Foreign Subsidiaries as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fulfill the conditions to the Company Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to this Section 7.07, including the preparation and making of the filings referred to in this Agreement and, if requested, amending or furnishing additional information thereunder, including, subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, upon request, providing copies of all related documents to the non-filing party and their advisors prior to filing, and, to the extent practicable, none of the parties will file any such document or have any communication with any Governmental Authority without prior consultation with the other party. Each party shall keep the other apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent practicable and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall permit representatives of the other party to participate in meetings and calls with such Governmental Authority. None of the parties shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts, delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Company Merger, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. 

   

 (d) Each of the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Company Parties, on the other hand, shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Third Party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. In the event that any Company Party shall fail to obtain any Third Party consent described above, the Company Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the Company Merger Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a Governmental Authority) with 

    ##### 

  

    

respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i) unless
required by the applicable agreement, without the prior written consent of
Parent, neither the Company nor any of the U.S. Subsidiaries or Foreign
Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person
and (ii) none of the Buyer Parties or their respective affiliates shall be
required to pay or commit to pay such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur
any liability or other obligation. 

   

 Section 7.08 Transfer Taxes. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the Company Common Shares, Company Share Options, Company Restricted Share Units and, all Transfer Taxes. 

  

 Section 7.09 Public Announcements. The parties hereto agree that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Mergers) shall be issued by a party without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the Mergers and the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.10 Cooperation with Financing. 

  

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to the Buyer Parties in such definitive agreements that are within their control. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment would or would be reasonably expected to materially and 

    ##### 

  

    

adversely affect or delay in any material respect Parents ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without first
obtaining the Companys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing (or
any alternative financing) has not been obtained, the Buyer Parties shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Mergers on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of this Agreement and to
Parents rights under Section 9.01, regardless of whether the Buyer Parties
have complied with all of their other obligations under this Agreement
(including their obligations under this Section 7.10). 

   

 (b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the U.S. Subsidiaries and the Foreign Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_  that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries and the Foreign Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries and the Foreign Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document for any Financing to be raised to complete the Mergers and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any Financing to be raised by Parent to complete the Mergers, (v) forming new direct or indirect subsidiaries and transferring assets thereto prior to or after the Operating Trust Merger Effective Time (any such transfer to be a Requested Transaction and be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.06 hereof), (vi) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, appraisals, surveys, title insurance, estoppels and certificates from tenants, lenders and ground lessors and other documentation and items relating to the Financing as reasonably requested by Parent, (vii) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and (viii) cooperating in connection with the repayment or defeasance of any Indebtedness of the Company or any of the U.S. Subsidiaries or Foreign Subsidiaries, including delivering such payoff, defeasance or similar notices under any existing mortgage or mezzanine loans of the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary or Foreign Subsidiary as reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, its U.S. Subsidiaries and its Foreign Subsidiaries and their Representatives in connection with such cooperation. The Buyer Parties shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its U.S. Subsidiaries and its Foreign Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information relating to the Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries or Foreign Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in Section 8.02(b), as it applies to the Companys obligations under this Section 7.10(b), shall be deemed satisfied unless the Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Companys or the U.S. Subsidiaries or Foreign Subsidiaries willful and material breach of its obligations under this Section 7.10(b). 

     ##### 

 

   

 (c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.11 Resignations. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of the Company Merger Effective Time, of those trustees or directors of the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company in writing at least five calendar days prior to the Closing.

 (c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have taken an action) which, in either such case, has become final and non-appealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Mergers illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Mergers (" _Governmental Order_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate under of this Section 9.01(c) shall not be available to any party unless such party shall have used its reasonable best efforts to oppose any such Governmental Order or to have such Governmental Order vacated or made inapplicable to such Mergers;

 (g) by Parent: 

    

 (i) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting if there has been a Change in Recommendation; 

   

 (ii) if (A) the Company Board or a Special Committee shall have approved, endorsed or recommended any Acquisition Proposal, (B) the Company enters into a contract or agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with Section 7.04(c)), (C) a tender offer or exchange offer for any Company Common Shares that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (other than by any of the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates) is commenced prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and the Company Board or a Special Committee fails to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company Shareholders (including, for these purposes, by taking no 

   ##### 

  

   

position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer by the Company Shareholders, which shall constitute a failure to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within
ten Business Days after commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer,
(D) the Company, the Company Board or a Special Committee publicly announces
its intention to do any of the foregoing, or (E) the Company has breached its
obligations under Section 7.02 or Section 7.04 in any material respect; or 

  

 (h) by the Company if the Company Board or a Special Committee approves, and authorizes the Company to enter into, a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal, but only so long as: 

    

 (i) the Company Shareholder Approval has not yet been obtained; 

   

 (ii) the Company is not then and has not been in breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.02 or Section 7.04 in any material respect; 

   

 (iii) the Company Board or a Special Committee has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, that such agreement constitutes a Superior Proposal;

 (v) during the three Business Day period following Parents receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice, (A) the Company shall have offered to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its respective financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiate in good faith with), Parent in making adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) the Company Board or a Special Committee shall have determined in good faith, after the end of such three Business Day period, after considering the results of such negotiations and the revised proposals made by Parent, if any, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such notice continues to be a Superior Proposal; provided further that any amendment, supplement or modification to any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(h) unless the Company has complied with the requirements of this Section 9.01(h) with respect to such new Acquisition Proposal including sending a Superior Proposal Notice with respect to such new Acquisition Proposal and offering to negotiate for three Business Days from such new Superior Proposal Notice; and 

   

 (vi) the Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.04(b)(iv) simultaneously with such termination (any purported

 Section 9.03 Notice of Termination. A termination party shall provide written notice of termination to the other parties specifying with reasonable particularity the basis of such termination.

 Section 9.04 Fees and Expenses. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise set forth in Sections 2.06, 7.08 and 7.10(b) and this Section 9.04, all expenses (including fees and expenses payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this Agreement or its Affiliates on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Mergers are consummated.

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(e), then the Company shall pay, within three (3) Business Days of the Termination Date, to Parent the Parent Expenses in immediately available funds to an account directed by Parent; 

   

 (iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(g) (but with respect to termination pursuant to Section 9.01(g)(i), only if Parent terminates prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting), then the Company shall pay, within three (3) Business Days of the Termination Date, to Parent the Company Termination Fee in immediately available funds to an account directed by Parent; or 

   

 (iv) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(h), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee in immediately available funds to an account directed by Parent before or concurrently with such termination and shall be a condition to the effectiveness of such termination. 

  

 (c) Parent agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(f), then Parent shall pay to the Company the Company Expenses within three (3) Business Days of the Termination Date in immediately available funds to an account directed by the Company. 

   

 (d) For the purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) " _Company Expenses_ " shall mean all reasonable, actual and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred prior to the termination of this Agreement by or on behalf of the Company Parties, the U.S. Subsidiaries and the Foreign Subsidiaries (or their Affiliates) in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, investment banking firms, lenders or financial advisors, accountants, and consultants, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $10,000,000; 

   

 (ii) " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount equal to $235,000,000; and

 (e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Company Expenses when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.04. If payable, none of 

    ##### 

  

    

the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses, or the Company Expenses
shall be payable more than once pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (f) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements set forth in this Section 9.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 9.04, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other party for the payment set forth in this Section 9.04, such paying party shall pay the other party its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of a termination of this Agreement in connection with which a Company Termination Fee is payable to Parent or, in the case of Section 9.04(b)(ii), the Parent Expenses are payable to Parent, payment of such Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, as the case may be, by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its subsidiaries and Affiliates against the Company, its subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company shall also be obligated with respect to Section 9.04(f)). 

   

 Section 9.05 Escrow of Company Expenses. 

  

 (a) To the extent that the Company Parties recover the Company Expenses pursuant to Section 9.04(c) and/or money damages pursuant to and subject to Section 10.06 and the Guarantees (collectively, the " _Damages Amount_ "), Parent shall instruct the escrow agent to pay to the Operating Trust from the Damages Amount deposited into escrow in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Damages Amount and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Operating Trust without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (B) in the event the Company receives either (A) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 9.05(b) or (2) an opinion from the Companys outside counsel as described in Section 9.05(b), an amount equal to the Damages Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. To secure Parents obligation to pay these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Damages Amount with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such terms (subject to Section 9.05(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the 

    ##### 

  

    

Operating Trust, Parent and the escrow agent. Subject to the terms of Section
10.06 and the Guarantees, the payment or deposit into escrow of the Damages
Amount pursuant to this Section 9.05 shall be made at the time Parent is
obligated to pay the Operating Trust such amount pursuant to Section 10.06
and the Guarantees by wire transfer or bank check. 

   

 (b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Damages Amount in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Operating Trust unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Companys independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Operating Trust without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the Damages Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Operating Trust of the Damages Amount would constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise disqualify Company as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Damages Amount to the Operating Trust. Parent agrees to amend this Section 9.05 at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Damages Amount that may be distributed to the Operating Trust hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 9.05(b), or (z) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 9.05(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Damages Amount held in escrow for five years shall be released by the escrow agent to Parent. Any costs and expenses of the escrow agent shall be borne solely by the Company. 

   

 Section 9.06 Waiver. At any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Company (on behalf of the Company Parties) or Parent (on behalf of the Buyer Parties), as applicable. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

This Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Maryland. 

  

 Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of State of Maryland (the "Maryland Courts") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail to the address for notice in Section 10.02 with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Maryland.

Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
