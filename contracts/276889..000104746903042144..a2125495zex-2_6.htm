 (b) _ Dispute._ Within 30 days following receipt by the Stockholder Representative of the Working Capital Statement, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver written notice to Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content of the Working Capital Statement.

 (d) _ Downward Adjustment._ If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(b)) is below the bottom of the Target Working Capital Range, then the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the amount of such shortfall, and the Stockholder Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to release an amount of cash equal to such shortfall from the Escrow Amount to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent. Such payment is to be made within five Business Days of the date on which Final Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(b).

 (a) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall notify the Stockholder Representative if it becomes aware of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event which has caused, or could reasonably be expected to cause, any representation or warranty made by it to be untrue or inaccurate at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

 7.9 _ _Allocation of Certain Taxes. 

  

  

 (a) The Stockholders and Buyer will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the appropriate Taxing Authority to close the taxable periods of the Company and the Subsidiary as of and including the Closing Date. In any case in which applicable Law does not require or permit such a taxable period of the Company or Subsidiary to be closed as of and including the Closing Date, any Tax pertaining to a period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.9 hereof. 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, all Taxes and Tax liabilities with respect to the income, property or operations of the Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, that relate to a Straddle Period will be apportioned between the period of the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date through the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and the period of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the " _Post-Closing Straddle Period_ ") in accordance with this Section 7.9(b). The portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall: (a) in the case of Taxes other than sales and use Taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period or Tax year in which the income, receipts or profits were earned ended on and included the Closing Date. To the extent any Tax is based on the greater of a Tax on net income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by income, on the other, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be deemed to be the greater of (A) the amount of such Tax measured by net worth or other basis determined as though the taxable values for the entire Straddle Period equal the respective values as of the Closing Date and multiplying the amount of such Tax by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period or (B) the amount of such Tax measured by net income determined as though the applicable Tax period terminated at the end of the day on the Closing Date. The portion of Tax related to the Post-Closing Straddle Period shall be calculated in a corresponding manner. 

  

  

 7.10 _ _Preparation of Tax Returns. 

  

  

 (a) The Stockholder Representative shall cause the Company to properly prepare and timely file any and all Tax Returns, the due date of which (including extensions) is on or before the

respect to the Company or Subsidiary with the appropriate Taxing Authority and
to be fully paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority the amount of Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns.

  

 (b) Buyer will cause to be properly prepared and timely filed each Tax Return (other than any Tax Return described in, and covered by, Section 7.10(a), covering Pre-Closing Periods or Straddle Periods which is required to be filed for, by, on behalf of or with respect to the Company or Subsidiary after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past custom and practices and to the extent any item is not covered by past practices, in accordance with reasonable Tax accounting practices. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer shall cause the items listed on Schedule 7.10 to be reported on the federal income Tax Return of the Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date, and any state, local or foreign Tax Returns to the extent allowed under applicable state, local or foreign Law. With respect to a Tax Return covering a Straddle Period, Buyer will cause to be properly prepared and timely filed each such Tax Return, which shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past custom and practices and to the extent any item is not covered by past practices, in accordance with reasonable Tax accounting practices and shall determine the portion of the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that is allocable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period, which determination shall be made in accordance with Section 7.9(b) and set forth in a statement (" _Statement_ ") prepared by Buyer. Buyer shall deliver a copy of any such Tax Return required to be filed by it pursuant to this Section 7.10(b) and any related Statement to the Stockholder Representative at least 30 calendar days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing such Tax Return. 

  

 (c) The amount of Taxes shown to be due on any Tax Return or any Statement described in Section 7.10(b) shall be final and binding upon the Stockholders, unless the Stockholder Representative shall have delivered to Buyer (within 20 calendar days after the date of the Stockholder Representative\'s receipt of any such Tax Return or any related Statement) a written report containing all changes that the Stockholder Representative proposes to make to such Tax Return or any related Statement. Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall undertake in good faith to resolve any issues raised in any such report prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing such Tax Return and mutually to consent to the filing of such Tax Return and, if applicable, to agree on the determination set forth in the Statement. In the event the Stockholder Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute by the earlier of (i) 20 calendar days after the date of the Stockholder Representative\'s receipt of written notice from Buyer setting forth Buyer\'s proposed resolution of such dispute, or (ii) two calendar days prior to the due date for filing of the Tax Return in question (including any extension thereof), the Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall jointly engage the Arbitration Firm to make its independent determination with respect to the item or items in dispute and the amount or amounts related thereto. Buyer shall bear and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by the Arbitration Firm, and one-half of the fees and other costs charged by the Arbitration Firm shall be paid from the Escrow Amount. The determination of the Arbitration Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.10(c) shall prohibit Buyer from causing the timely filing of any Tax Returns required to be filed under Section 7.10(b) but Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed, amended Tax Returns to the extent necessary to reflect the parties\' resolution pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 7.10(c). Buyer shall timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, all Taxes shown to be due on the Tax Returns filed under Section 7.10(b). Buyer shall only be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount, without duplication for Damages referred to in Section 10.5(e), for (i) Taxes shown as due and owing on Tax Returns required to be filed by it pursuant to this Section 7.10 for Pre-Closing Periods (not including Straddle Periods) of the Company or Subsidiary and (ii) the Taxes shown on a Statement for Straddle Periods of the Company or Subsidiary, only to the extent 

  

    
  

such Taxes have become final and binding on the Stockholders pursuant to this
Section 7.10 and to the extent such Taxes exceed (prior to application of the
provisions of Section 10.5), in the following order, the aggregate of: (A) the
Tax Accrual, provided that the Tax Accrual shall reduce the amount of such
Taxes only to the extent that such Tax Accrual is related to such type of
Taxes (and the Seller agrees that no reserve shall have been included in the
Tax Accrual with respect to the disallowance or deferral of items listed in
Schedule 7.10). To the extent such Taxes exceed the Tax Accrual, (B) the NOL
Tax Benefit, provided that the NOL Tax Benefit shall reduce only Income Taxes
(as reduced if at all by Section 7.10(c)(i)). To the extent such Taxes exceed
the NOL Tax Benefit, (C) the Tax Refund, provided that the Tax Refund shall
reduce the amount of such Taxes (as reduced if at all by Section 7.10(c)(i)
or (ii)) only to the extent such Tax Refund relates to the taxing
jurisdiction and type of such Taxes, as such Tax Accrual, NOL Tax Benefit, or
Tax Refund (the " _Tax Basket Items_ ") may have been reduced by previous
application of this Section 7.10(c) or pursuant to Section 10.5(e).

  

 (d) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit examinations and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the tax liabilities imposed on the Company or Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Periods, Buyer, the Company and Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, shall reasonably cooperate with each other, including, without limitation, the furnishing or making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of accounts, or other materials reasonably necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. 

  

 (e) Buyer shall not allow the Company to waive the carryback period with respect to any net operating loss for any Pre-Closing Period. 

  

  

 7.11 _ _Controversies. Written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes for which the Stockholders may be liable under this Agreement (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_ ") shall be governed in accordance with the procedures in Section 10.7.

 9.2 _ _Effect of Termination.

The obligations of the parties to this Agreement under Section 7.3 (as such Section relates to confidentiality), Section 7.5, Section 9.2 and Article XI will survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

    
ARTICLE X 
REMEDIES 

   

 10.1 _ _Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Stockholders, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing Date, but only to the extent specified below. 

  

  

 (a) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing Date until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, at which point such representations and warranties and any claim for reimbursement out of the Escrow Amount or claim for indemnification by any Stockholder Indemnitee, as applicable, on account thereof will terminate. 

   

 (b) All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that contemplate performance thereof following the Closing Date will survive the Closing Date until the earlier of (i) the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the expiration of such covenant or agreement in accordance with its terms (such date, the " _Covenant Termination Date_ "). 

  

  

 10.2 _ _Claims Against the Escrow Amount by Buyer Indemnitees. From and after the Closing Date, the Stockholders shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and the Company and their successors and permitted assigns, officers, employees, directors and stockholders (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") for, and will pay to Buyer Indemnitees, the amount of any and all losses, costs, liabilities, encumbrances, damages, claims, fines, penalties, assessments, judgments, expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of outside attorneys), reasonable costs of investigation (including reasonable fees and expenses of outside accountants, consultants and experts reasonably engaged), amounts paid in settlement, court costs, and other expenses of litigation but excluding any and all internal costs and expenses incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnitees in connection with any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Damages_ ") incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee arising out of (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of any Stockholder, Optionholder or Warrantholder contained in this 

   Agreement or any related agreements, (b) any breach by any of the

provide the Buyer Indemnitees indemnification for Damages based on undisclosed
liabilities or obligations of the Company or Subsidiary that exist as of the
Closing Date, whether known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, except for
those exceptions specified in Section 4.29. For purposes of clarification,
any liability or obligation of the Company or Subsidiary that results from a
condition, event, circumstance, activity, practice, incident, action or
omission that occurred or existed on or prior to the Closing Date shall
constitute a liability or obligation of the Company or Subsidiary that existed
as of the Closing Date, even if the claim related to such liability or
obligation is not asserted until after the Closing Date.

  

 10.3 _ _Indemnification of Stockholder Indemnitees. Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders and Optionholders and their respective successors and permitted assigns, heirs and personal representatives and the officers, employees, directors and stockholders of the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders (collectively, the "Stockholder Indemnitees") for, and will pay to the Stockholder Indemnitees the amount of any, Damages actually incurred by a Stockholder Indemnitee arising out of (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or (b) any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that survive the Closing Date. 

  

 10.4 _ _Exclusive Remedy. The parties agree that, from and after the Closing Date, the exclusive remedies of the parties for any Damages arising out of or based upon the matters set forth in this Agreement are the reimbursement obligations described in Section 7.14 and the indemnification obligations of the parties set forth in this Article X. The provisions of this Section 10.4 shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action (a) on account of fraud, (b) under Section 11.1 to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof or (c) under Section 2.3(b) to enforce any decision or determination of the Arbitration Firm. 

  

 10.5 _ _Limitations on Reimbursement to Buyer Indemnitees. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the right of the Buyer Indemnitees to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount is limited as follows: 

  

  

 (a) Except as set forth in the immediately following sentence, the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 10.2 for any Damages until the total of all such Damages suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees exceeds the sum of $500,000, in which event the Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to reimbursement out of the Escrow Amount for all Damages exceeding such amount up to a maximum of the Escrow Amount; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing sentence shall not apply with respect to any Damages arising out of any breach of any representation or warranty in Section 4.19 or the matters listed on Schedule 4.19 or the product warranty and liability matters described in Section 7.14 and Buyer shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Account for all such Damages up to a maximum of the Escrow Amount. Any Damages of a Buyer Indemnitee shall not be included in calculating the $500,000 threshold described in this Section 10.5(a) to the extent it arises out of a contract (other than a Material Contract) entered into by the Company or Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business since the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Buyer Indemnitees\' right to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 10.2 on account of any Damages will be reduced by all insurance or other third party indemnification proceeds actually received by the Buyer Indemnitees. Buyer and the Company 

  

    
  

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover any Damages
suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees under any such insurance policies or other
third party indemnities.

   

 (c) Except with respect to Damages actually awarded to a third party in an action brought against a Buyer Indemnitee, the Buyer Indemnitees are not entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 10.2 for punitive damages, or for lost profits, consequential, exemplary or special damages. 

  

 (d) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 10.2 to the extent that any Buyer Indemnitee has been compensated therefor pursuant to Section 2.3. 

   

 (e) The Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 10.2, without duplication for any Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period as determined under Section 7.10, for Damages arising solely out of any breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.6 or matters listed on Schedule 4.6 only to the extent such Damages exceed (prior to application of the other provisions of Section 10.5), in the following order, the aggregate of: (A) the Tax Accrual, provided that the Tax Accrual shall reduce the amount of such Damages only to the extent that such Tax Accrual is related to such type of Taxes (and the Seller agrees that no reserve shall have been included in the Tax Accrual with respect to the disallowance or deferral of items listed in Schedule 7.10). To the extent such Damages exceed the Tax Accrual, (B) the NOL Tax Benefit, provided that the NOL Tax Benefit shall reduce the amount of such Damages (as reduced if at all by Section 10.5(e)(A)) only to the extent such Damages are incurred as a result of Income Taxes. To the extent such Damages exceed the NOL Tax Benefit, (C) the Tax Refund, provided that the Tax Refund shall reduce the amount of such Damages (as reduced if at all by Section 10.5(e)(A) or (B)) only to the extent such Tax Refund relates to the taxing jurisdiction and type of Tax that is the subject matter of the Damages, as such Tax Basket Items may have been reduced by previous application of this Section 10.5(e) or pursuant to Section 7.10. 

  

 (f) (i) With respect to any claim based on a Remedial Action, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 10.2(a) only if the Remedial Action is undertaken (A) in response to a claim by a third party, including a Governmental Authority, against a Buyer Indemnitee, or (B) to correct, eliminate or otherwise address a matter or condition that constitutes a violation of Environmental Laws. 

    

 (ii) With respect to a claim based on a Remedial Action undertaken in response to a claim by a Governmental Authority, it is a condition precedent to the right of the Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification or to be held harmless for such claim that the Buyer Indemnitees shall not solicit or importune any Governmental Authority to require such Remedial Action, unless the Buyer Indemnitees reasonably believe that they are required to do so by Environmental Laws; _provided_ that this provision shall not preclude a Buyer Indemnitee from conducting, subsequent to the Closing, any environmental investigation or assessment activities, including soil and groundwater sampling, the Buyer Indemnitee deems necessary or desirable, or, to the extent Buyer Indemnitees reasonably believe that they are required to do so by Environmental Laws, from reporting to the appropriate Governmental Authority the results of any environmental investigation or assessment activities, including the results of the soil and groundwater sampling described in the Limited Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Report prepared by GZA GeoEnvironmental, Inc., dated November 7, 2003, with respect to the Real Property located at 403 Treuhaft Boulevard, Barbourville, Kentucky. 

   

 (iii) Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to indemnification or to be held harmless with respect to a Remedial Action that is not required to be conducted by Environmental Law or by a pre-Closing contractual agreement of the Company or Subsidiary. In this regard, the 

   

     
  

Stockholders acknowledge that some form of Remedial Action is required by
Environmental Laws with respect to the ethylbenzene discovered in the Limited
Phase II Environmental Site Assessment conducted by GZA GeoEnvironmental,
Inc. at the Real Property located at 403 Treuhaft Boulevard, Barbourville,
Kentucky, and the Stockholders shall indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for any such
Remedial Action required by Environmental Laws.

  

 (iv) Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to indemnification or to be held harmless to the extent (A) a Remedial Action is based on a cleanup standard that is more stringent or costly than the cleanup standard applicable to non-residential properties, unless the more stringent or costly Remedial Action is required by a pre-Closing contractual agreement of the Company or Subsidiary or (B) the Buyer Indemnitees fail to take reasonable actions to mitigate any Damages attributable to the Remedial Action, including where appropriate and reasonable, the use of environmental deed restrictions and the installation of engineering controls on the owned Real Property, _provided_ that such restrictions or controls do not prevent, inhibit or increase the cost of either the business operations conducted on the owned Real Property or any construction or development plan the Company or Subsidiary has for such owned Real Property as non-residential property, and do not materially decrease the value of the owned Real Property as non-residential property. The cost of any actions required with respect to such restrictions and controls, including any post-closure monitoring or maintenance, shall be Damages for which Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under the provisions of Section 10.2. 

   

  

 10.6 _ _Limitations on Indemnification by Buyer Indemnitees. 

  

  

 (a) The Stockholder Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 for any Damages until the total of all such Damages suffered by the Stockholder Indemnitees exceeds the sum of $500,000, in which event the Stockholder Indemnitees will be entitled to indemnification for all Damages up to a maximum of $12,000,000. 

  

 (b) The Stockholder Indemnitees\' right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 on account of any Damages will be reduced by all insurance or other third party indemnification proceeds actually received by the Stockholder Indemnitees. The Stockholders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover any Damages suffered by the Stockholder Indemnitees under any such insurance policies or other third party indemnities. 

  

 (c) Except with respect to Damages actually awarded to a third party in an action brought against a Stockholder Indemnitee, the Stockholder Indemnitees are not entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 for punitive damages, or for lost profits, consequential, exemplary or special damages. 

  

  

 10.7 _ _Procedures. 

  

  

 (a) _ Notice of Damages by Stockholder Indemnitee._ Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X, if any Stockholder Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has a claim for Damages, the Stockholder Indemnitee shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of the claim, give written notice of such Damages (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to Buyer describing the Damages in reasonable detail and indicating the amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible) of Damages that have been or may be suffered by the applicable Stockholder Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to give a Claims Notice by the Stockholder Representative to Buyer pursuant to this Section 10.7(a) will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that the Stockholder Representative has under this Agreement, or alter or relieve Buyer of its obligation to indemnify the applicable Stockholder Indemnitee except to the extent that they are materially prejudiced thereby. Buyer shall respond to the Stockholder Representative (a " _Claim Response_ ") within 30 days (the " _Response Period_ ") after the date that the Claims Notice is sent by the 

  

    

Stockholder Representative. Any Claim Response must specify whether or not
Buyer disputes the claim described in the Claims Notice. If Buyer fails to
give a Claim Response within the Response Period, Buyer will be deemed not to
dispute the claim described in the related Claims Notice. If Buyer elects not
to dispute a claim described in a Claims Notice, whether by failing to give a
timely Claim Response or otherwise, then the amount of Damages alleged in
such Claims Notice will be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of Buyer
and Buyer shall pay, in cash to the Stockholder Representative within 30 days
after the last day of the applicable Response Period, the amount specified in
the Claims Notice. If Buyer delivers a Claim Response within the Response
Period indicating that it disputes one or more of the matters identified in
the Claims Notice, Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly
meet and use their reasonable efforts to settle the dispute. If Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days after
the conclusion of the Response Period, then the dispute must be resolved in
accordance with Section 10.8. 

   

 (b) _ Notice of Damages by Buyer Indemnitee._ 

    

 (i) _ Claims with Determinable Damages._ Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X if any Buyer Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has a claim for reimbursement against the Escrow Amount (an " _Escrow Claim_ ") the amount of which is then known, Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of such Escrow Claim, notify the Stockholder Representative of such Escrow Claim by means of a written notice specifying the nature, circumstances and amount of such Escrow Claim setting forth in reasonable detail the underlying facts actually known or in good faith believed by the Buyer Indemnitee to exist sufficient to establish, as of the date of such notice, the basis for the Escrow Claim and setting forth Buyer Indemnitee\'s good faith calculation of the Damages incurred by the applicable Buyer Indemnitee with respect thereto (an " _Escrow Claim Notice_ " and, together with a Claims Notice, a " _Notice_ "). The failure by Buyer to promptly deliver an Escrow Claim Notice under this Section 10.7(b)(i) will not adversely affect the applicable Buyer Indemnitee\'s right to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount except to the extent the Stockholder Representative is prejudiced thereby. If, by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the 30th day following receipt by the Stockholder Representative of an Escrow Claim Notice (the " _Dispute Period_ "), Buyer has not received from the Stockholder Representative notice in writing that the Stockholder Representative objects to the Escrow Claim (or the amount of Damages set forth therein) asserted in such Escrow Claim Notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the Escrow Amount the amount of Damages specified in the Claim Notice subject to the limitations contained in this Article X. 

   

 (ii) _ Claims without Determinable Damages._ Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X, if any Buyer Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has an Escrow Claim the amount of which cannot reasonably be determined, Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of such Escrow Claim, notify the Stockholder Representative by means of an Escrow Claim Notice that contains the information required by Section 10.7(b)(i)  and a good faith estimate, if possible, of Buyer\'s calculation of the Damages incurred by the applicable Buyer Indemnitees with respect thereto. The failure by Buyer to promptly deliver an Escrow Claim Notice under this Section 10.7(b)(ii) will not adversely affect the applicable Buyer Indemnitee\'s right to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount except to the extent the Stockholder Representative is prejudiced thereby. If Buyer has not received a Dispute Notice from the Stockholder Representative within the Dispute Period, Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver one or more joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the Escrow Amount the amount of Damages specified from time to time as the amount of any such Escrow Claim becomes known, _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder Representative will be under no obligation to agree to any such payments and the making of any one such payment will be without prejudice to the continuing right of the Stockholder Representative to object to any further payment. 

   

     

   

  

   

 (iii) _ Disputes._ If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer within the Dispute Period, Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly meet and use their reasonable efforts to settle the dispute as to whether and to what extent the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to reimbursement on account of such Escrow Claim. If Buyer and the Stockholder Representative are able to reach agreement within 30 days after Buyer receives such Dispute Notice, Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent setting forth such agreement and instructing the Escrow Agent to release funds held under the Escrow Agreement in accordance with such agreement. If Buyer and the Stockholder Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days after Buyer receives such Dispute Notice, then the dispute must be resolved in accordance with Section 10.8. For all purposes of this Article X (including, without limitation, those pertaining to disputes under Section 10.7(a) and this Section 10.7(b)(iii)), Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate with and make available to the other party and its respective representatives all information, records and data and shall permit reasonable access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the resolution of such disputes. 

    

 (c) _ Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims._ In the event of any claim by a third party against any Buyer Indemnitee or Stockholder Indemnitee for which indemnification is available hereunder, the Indemnifying Party has the right, exercisable by written notice to Buyer or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, within 30 days of receipt of a Notice from Buyer or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, of the commencement or assertion of any Damages arising out of such claim, to assume and conduct the defense of such claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to Buyer or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable. If the Indemnifying Party is the Stockholder Representative, such Indemnifying Party will be entitled to defend and, subject to the provisions of Section 10.7(d), settle such claim using the Escrow Amount, and the Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release funds held under the Escrow Agreement for this purpose in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party is Buyer, such Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to defend such claim using the Escrow Amount. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed such defense as provided in this Section 10.7(c), the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Indemnitee has the right to employ counsel separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any claim that the Indemnifying Party is defending and to participate in such defense, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the Indemnitee\'s own expense, unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) such Indemnitee has been advised by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for such Indemnitee to employ separate counsel in order to effectively assert such defense or defenses. In such event, if the Indemnifying Party is the Stockholder Representative, then the fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne from the Escrow Amount, and the Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release funds held under the Escrow Agreement for this purpose in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any third party claim in accordance with this Section 10.7(c), the Indemnitee may continue to defend such claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X. The Indemnitee will not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (such 

  

    

consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), no Indemnifying Party,
in the defense of any such claim, shall consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement that (i) provides for injunctive or other
nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnitee or (ii) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnitee of a release from all liability with respect to such claim or
litigation. In any such third party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall keep
the Indemnitee reasonably apprised of all proceedings associated therewith
and shall provide to the Indemnitee all information reasonably requested by
the Indemnitee.

  

 (d) _ Settlement._ The party responsible for the defense of any third party claim (the " _Responsible Party_ ") shall promptly notify the other party of each settlement offer with respect to a third party claim. Such other party shall notify the Responsible Party with reasonable promptness whether or not such party is willing to accept the proposed settlement offer.

After the effective date of the resignation, the Escrow Agent will be under no further obligation to perform any of the duties under this Agreement other than to deliver the Escrow Amount (and any Earnings thereon) and any notices, written communications, or documents received by the Escrow Agent to the successor escrow agent. The provisions of _Section 3.3_ will survive the resignation of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 Section 3.5 _ Removal._ The Escrow Agent may be removed (with or without cause) and a new escrow agent may be appointed upon the mutual agreement of the Stockholder Representative and Buyer. In such event, the Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall deliver a Joint Certificate to the Escrow Agent notifying the Escrow Agent of such removal together with written instructions authorizing delivery of the Escrow Amount (and any Earnings thereon) to a successor escrow agent. All power, authority, duties and obligations of the Escrow Agent will apply to any successor escrow agent. The provisions of _Section 3.3_ will survive the removal of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 Section 3.6 _ Successors._ If the bank acting as the Escrow Agent merges or consolidates with another bank or sells or transfers all or substantially all of its assets or trust business, then the successor or resulting bank will be the Escrow Agent hereunder without the necessity of further action or the execution of any document, so long as such successor or resulting bank meets the requirements of a successor escrow agent hereunder.
