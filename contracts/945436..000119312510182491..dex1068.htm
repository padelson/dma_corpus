anticipates incurring an Indemnified Loss and desires to seek indemnification with respect thereto on behalf of a Shareholder Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the &#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) shall give reasonably

Person&#146;s set-off rights or rights in the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or otherwise, but no such Person shall be entitled to actually collect indemnification in respect of such claim unless and until any such reasonably anticipated
