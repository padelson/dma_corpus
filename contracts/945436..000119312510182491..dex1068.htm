of Merger and with respect to which appraisal rights have been properly and
timely perfected in accordance with the Act (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at

Shares and shall be converted into and represent the right to receive, when
and as payable, the portion of the Merger Consideration payable with respect
to such Shares hereunder upon surrender of the Certificates representing such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with _Section 1.5_ hereof. The Company shall

Preferred Stock and Company Warrants entitled to make a Stock Election
determined in accordance with the Elections made pursuant to _Section
1.13(b)_, (iv) the aggregate amount of cash that each such Securityholder is
entitled to receive as Initial Merger Consideration and, if and to the extent
earned, the aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that each such Securityholder is entitled to receive as
Earnout Consideration, (v) the interest of each Securityholder in any cash to
be paid by the Parent pursuant to the terms of  _Section 1.10_, (vi) the

Account at the Closing potentially allocable to each such Securityholder
pursuant to this Agreement, (vii) the aggregate amount of cash to be
deposited into the Expense Escrow Fund at the Closing for and on behalf of
each such Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement, and (viii) any other

exchange for the Shares, Company Options and Company Warrants, and as set
forth on the Spreadsheet, at any time exceed the amount of the Merger
Consideration calculated as set forth in  _Section 1.4_, and subject to
adjustment to the Merger Consideration permitted by the terms of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Parents indemnification rights or
by exercise of Parents set-off rights), in no event shall the aggregate
amount payable by Parent for the benefit of the Securityholders under this
Agreement in exchange for the Shares, Company Options and Company Warrants,
and as set forth on the Spreadsheet be less than the amount of the
Merger Consideration calculated as set forth in _Section 1.4_.

Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), promptly following the Closing,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit
of the holders of Shares and Company Warrants, cash necessary to pay the
Initial Merger Consideration to be paid (excluding amounts payable under
_Section 1.6(a)_ for Company Options) in connection with the Merger (the "
_Exchange Fund_ ," it being understood that any and all interest earned on
funds deposited therein pending payment shall be turned over to Parent). For
the avoidance of doubt, the Parent shall not deposit with the Exchange Agent,
and the Exchange Fund shall not include, (x) any cash to be paid into the
Indemnification Escrow Account or Expense Escrow Fund at Closing, (y) any
Earnout Consideration or (z) any consideration payable to holders of Company
Options under _Section 1.6(a)_. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for in this _Section
1.9_ and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(c) Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver, within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, to

time in writing by the Company) a letter of transmittal and instructions for
use in effecting a surrender of the Certificates, if applicable, in exchange
for its respective portion of the Merger Consideration in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). Upon surrender of a
Certificate, if applicable, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together
with the submission of a duly completed and validly executed Letter of
Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, the holder of the Shares and Company
Warrants to which such Letter of Transmittal relates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor cash (without interest) (and, in respect of any
Earnout Consideration that becomes payable hereunder, shares of Parent Common
Stock, if applicable) representing such holders respective portion of the
Merger Consideration calculated in accordance with, and payable when and as
provided in, this Agreement. Following the Effective Time and pending
a holders submission of a Letter of Transmittal, each such holder of
outstanding Shares and Company Warrants will be deemed, for all purposes, to
hold an irrevocable right to receive that amount of consideration equal to
his, her or its respective portion of the Merger Consideration into which
such holders Shares or Company Warrants shall have been so converted in
accordance with this Agreement.

(d) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver, no later than five (5) Business Days after submission of a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, to each holder of
a Company Warrant and Shareholder that has submitted such Letter of
Transmittal cash (without interest), representing such Securityholders
respective portion of the Initial Merger Consideration calculated and payable
in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(e) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
transfer books of the Company of the Shares or Company Warrants that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(f) Upon the request of Parent, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by a holder of Shares or Company Warrants eighteen (18) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent and any such Securityholder
who has not returned a Letter of Transmittal in accordance with this 
_Section 1.9_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of such holders portion of the Initial Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, subject to
applicable Law, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Representative or
any other party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any Merger
Consideration properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Subject to applicable Law, any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares or Company
Warrants three (3) years after the Effective Time (or, in either case, such
earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of the United States or any other nation, state,
or bilateral or multilateral governmental authority, any local governmental
unit or subdivision thereof, or any branch, agency, or judicial body
thereof (" _Government_ ") shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

1.10 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Company Pre-Closing Estimates_. At least five Business Days prior to the

Capital_ "), (ii) the Indebtedness of the Company as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and (iii) the New
Investment Adjustment Amount as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Estimated New Investment Adjustment Amount_ ") (such statement being,
the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "). The Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital shall be calculated in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied in a manner consistent
with accounting principles, policies, methodologies, practices and procedures
applied in the preparation of the Annual Financial Statements and, where
applicable, the accounting principles, policies, methodologies, practices and

that in the event of a conflict between the accounting principles, policies,

methodologies, practices and procedures set forth on _Schedule 1.10(a)(i)_ ,
the accounting principles, policies, methodologies, practices and
procedures set forth on _Schedule 1.10(a)(i)_ shall supersede, govern and
control). The items comprising the Estimated Indebtedness and the Estimated
New Investment Adjustment Amount as of the date hereof are set forth on
_Schedule 1.10(a)(ii)_. Following Parents receipt of the Estimated Closing
Statement, the Company shall afford Parent reasonable access to copies of the
working papers of the Company prepared or used in connection with the
Companys preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement. Parent shall have
an opportunity to review with the Company and object to (but not determine)
all or any part of the Estimated Closing Statement, such review to be
reasonably prompt and any objection to be reasonable and in good faith. In
the event that Parent shall object to any portion of the Estimated Closing
Statement, Parent and the Company shall discuss Parents objections in good
faith. The Estimated Closing Statement as finally agreed upon by the Company
and Parent shall be the " _Agreed Estimated Closing Statement_ ". The Agreed
Estimated Closing Statement shall be used to adjust the Merger Consideration
payable and issuable at the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ hereof.

(b) _Parent Post-Closing Calculation of Closing Net Working Capital_. As soon
as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within
ninety (90) calendar days thereof, Parent shall deliver to the Representative,

Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a statement (the " _Closing Statement of Net Working
Capital_ ") setting forth a calculation of Net Working Capital of the Company
as of the Closing determined using the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing
Net Working Capital_ "), (iii) a statement (the " _Closing Statement of

prior to the Effective Time (" _Closing Indebtedness_ ") and (iv) a statement
(the " _Closing Statement of New Investment Adjustment Amount_ ") reflecting
the New Investment Adjustment Amount as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Closing New Investment Adjustment Amount_ "). The Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement of Net Working Capital, the Closing
Statement of Indebtedness and the Closing Statement of New Investment
Adjustment Amount is referred to herein as the " _Closing Statement_." For
purposes of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to,
take, within a reasonable period of time following the Closing, a physical
count of the inventory of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries.
Designees of the Representative may observe the taking of such physical count.
The Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Net Working Capital shall be calculated

preparation of the Annual Financial Statements and the Estimated Closing
Statement and, where applicable, the accounting principles, policies,

(c) _Determination of Final Net Working Capital_.

 

(i) Upon delivery of the Closing Statement, Parent shall provide the
Representative and its accountants reasonable access to the accountants and
accounting records of the Company and to any and all working papers prepared
by the Company or Parent related to the preparation of the Closing Statement.
If the Representative disagrees with the calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital, the calculation of Closing Indebtedness, or the
calculation of the Closing New Investment Adjustment Amount, the
Representative shall notify Parent of such disagreement in writing, setting
forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, within
thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Closing Statement or, if the
adjustments proposed by Parent with respect to the Closing Statement equal or
exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate (either positive or negative), within
forty-five (45) days after its receipt of the Closing Statement. In the event
that the Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within
such thirty (30) or forty-five (45) day period, as applicable,
the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement and
the calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and
the Closing New Investment Adjustment Amount reflected thereon, which if not
objected to within the relevant thirty (30) or forty-five (45) day period, as
applicable, shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided,
Parent and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a
period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree)
to resolve any disagreements with respect to the Closing Statement and/or the
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and the
Closing New Investment Adjustment Amount, as the case may be.

(ii) If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then Parent and the Representative shall mutually select an
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing (the " _Auditor_
") to act as a referee to resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor
shall determine as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty
(30) calendar days of the date on which such dispute is referred to the
Auditor, based solely on the terms of this Agreement, any remaining disputes.
Each of Parent and the Representative (or their respective designees) shall be
permitted to submit a proposed Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Statement of
Indebtedness or Closing Statement of New Investment Adjustment Amount, as the
case may be and applicable supporting documentation and to make a presentation
to the Auditor in connection with the resolution of any such disagreements,
and, without the mutual agreement of Parent and the Representative, the
Auditor shall not rely on or consider any other documents, materials,
presentations or evidence (other than the plain language of the Agreement) in
making its determination. It is the intent of the Parties that the process set
forth in this  _Section 1.10(c)_ and the activities of the Auditor in
connection herewith are not (and should not be considered to be or treated as)
an arbitration proceeding or similar arbitral process and that no formal
arbitration rules should be followed (including, in particular, but without
limitation, rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The fees and
expenses of the Auditor incurred in connection with its review and resolution
of any disputes shall be allocated between Parent, on one hand, and the
Securityholders, on the other, by the Auditor in proportion to the extent
either of Parent or the Securityholders did not prevail in the aggregate on
items in dispute on their respective Closing Balance Sheet or
Closing Statement of Indebtedness or Closing Statement of New Investment
Adjustment Amount, as the case may be; _provided,_ that such fees and expenses
shall not include, so long as a Party complies with the procedures of this
Section, the other Partys outside counsel, accounting or other fees. The
determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties.

(iii) The amounts of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness
and Closing New Investment Adjustment Amount as finally determined in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 1.10_ shall be referred to as the
" _Final Closing Net Working Capital_ ," " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ,"
and " _Final Closing New Investment Adjustment Amount_ ," respectively. The
date on which the Final Closing Net Working Capital, the Final Closing
Indebtedness and the Final Closing New Investment Adjustment Amount are
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 1.10(c)_ is hereinafter
referred to as, the " _Determination Date._ "

 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(A) " _Adjustment Amount_ ," means the sum of (x) the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, (y) the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, and (z) the
Investment Adjustment Amount.

(B) " _Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or
negative, means (A) the Final Closing Net Working Capital, minus (B) the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(C) " _Indebtedness Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative,
means the (A) Final Closing Indebtedness, minus (B) Estimated Indebtedness,
each expressed as a negative number.

(D) " _Investment Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative,
means the (A) Final Closing New Investment Adjustment Amount minus the amount
of Final Closing Net Working Capital, if a positive number, _minus_  (B) the
Estimated New Investment Adjustment Amount minus the amount of Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, if a positive number.

 

(ii) For purposes of convenience only, the Parties agree that upon the final
determination of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Indebtedness
Adjustment Amount, and the Investment Adjustment Amount, such amounts shall be
aggregated for the purpose of paying the Adjustment Amount to Parent or the
Securityholders, as the case may be. For example, if the Indebtedness
Adjustment Amount equals negative $1,000,000 (i.e., such amount is owed to
Parent), the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount equals positive $100,000
(i.e., such amount is owed to the Securityholders), and the Investment
Adjustment Amount equals $0 each as finally determined, then the Adjustment
Amount would be negative $900,000 and such amount would be owed to Parent in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 1.10_. Additional illustrative
examples of these calculations are set forth on _Schedule 1.10(d)_.

hereof, with such distributions to be made to each such Securityholder, in
each such case, in accordance with the Spreadsheet (other than any
Securityholder who holds Dissenting Shares).

(iv) _Negative Adjustment Amount_. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event

accordance with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement attached
hereto as Exhibit F (the " _Indemnification Escrow Agreement_ "). The
Indemnification Escrow Account shall be treated for tax purposes as owned by
Parent, and any interest or other income thereon will be treated as income of
Parent.

 

(b) _Remaining Balance in Indemnification Escrow Account_. Upon the expiration
of the eighteen (18) month period following the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Escrow Agent (in accordance with the terms of the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement) to pay (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the Exchange Agent any remaining amounts of cash in the Indemnification
Escrow Account (not then claimed by Parent to be owed to a Parent Indemnified
Person), together with any interest earned on any such amount, for
distribution to the Securityholders that have properly completed a Letter of
Transmittal in accordance with _Section 1.9_, with such distribution to be
made to each such Securityholder in accordance with the Spreadsheet and the

Parent shall have an opportunity to review with the Company and object to (but
not determine) all or any part of the Estimated Transaction Expenses, such
review to be reasonably prompt and any objection to be reasonable and in good

Transaction Expenses, Parent and the Company shall discuss Parents objections
in good faith. 

(b) _Payment of Estimated Transaction Expenses_. On the Closing Date, Parent

(C) otherwise fails to satisfy the requirements of  _Section 1.13(b)_ to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent on or prior to the Election Deadline,

it being understood and agreed that if Parent or the Company have a good
faith reason to believe that a holder of shares of Series 2 Preferred Stock or
Series 1 Preferred Stock or a holder of a Preferred Stock Warrant has
attempted to make a Stock Election prior to the Election Deadline, but such
Stock Election fails to satisfy the requirements of this _Section 1.13(b)_,

(viii) In the event that a holder of shares of Series 2 Preferred Stock or
Series 1 Preferred Stock or a holder of Preferred Stock Warrants makes a valid

Consideration that would have been payable in cash in respect of such shares
of Series 2 Preferred Stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock and such Preferred
Stock Warrants shall, in lieu thereof, be paid in a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Earnout

Stock Warrants but for such Stock Election, by (y) $11.80 (the " _Parent

pursuant to  _Section 1.13(b)_ shall be entitled to receive in lieu thereof
an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction
(rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share) by the Parent Common Stock
Value. For purposes of determining any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, all Earnout Consideration payable to each such
holder at any single payment date of any Earnout Consideration in respect of
all shares of Series 2 Preferred Stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock and each
Preferred Stock Warrant held by such holder as of immediately prior to such
payment date shall be aggregated.

 

(d) In the event that, at any time from and after the date hereof and prior to
the payment of any Earnout Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, Parent
shall pay a dividend in, split in a greater number of shares, combine into a
smaller number of shares, or issue by reclassification, any shares of Parent
Common Stock, then the Parent Common Stock Value and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Series 2 Preferred Stock,
Series 1 Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Warrants who have made a valid
Stock Election pursuant hereto the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after
the date of such event, be the Parent Common Stock Value or other dependent
item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
sentence.

(e) The Earnout Shares issuable by Parent shall be issued in reliance on
available exemptions from registration requirements under applicable
securities Laws.

(f) _Operation of Surviving Company_. _Schedule 1.13(f)_ sets forth certain
covenants with respect to the operation of the Surviving Company during the

Earnout Statement for the Earnout Period shall be deemed to be final and
binding upon Parent, the Representative and the Securityholders in the form
in which it was delivered to the Representative by Parent. If the

(e) _Expenses_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Expense Escrow
Amount to be deposited with the Escrow Agent, such deposit to constitute a
source of reimbursement for any actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Representative in connection with the performance of its

Expense Escrow Fund shall be used to reimburse the actual out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including legal, accounting and other advisors fees and
expenses, if applicable) incurred by the Representative in performing all of
its duties and obligations as the Representative hereunder. Each
Securityholder hereby authorizes the Representatives to enter into an escrow
agreement (the " _Representative Expense Escrow Agreement_ ") with the Escrow
Agent under such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the
Representative and the Escrow Agent consistent with the terms hereof and in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent. If any portion of the Expense Escrow

expenses may be recovered by the Representative from the funds in the Expense
Escrow Fund and the Indemnification Escrow Account otherwise distributable to
the Securityholders pursuant to the terms hereof and the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement and Expense Escrow Account at the time of distribution;
provided that while this section allows the Representative to be paid from the
Expense Escrow Fund and the Indemnification Escrow Account, this does not
relieve the Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such losses,
liabilities or expenses, nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

to the extent necessary so that no payment received by such "disqualified
individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code
(determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code), in a manner
that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall have delivered to Parent evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (i) that Shareholder approval was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and
the requisite Shareholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments
that were subject to the Shareholder vote (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (ii)
that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such
"parachute payments" shall not be made or provided, pursuant to the waivers
of those payments and/or benefits which were executed by the affected
individuals prior to Shareholder vote. Such vote shall establish the
"disqualified individuals" right to the payment or other compensation. In
addition, before the vote is submitted to the Shareholders, the Company shall
provide adequate disclosure to the Shareholders of all material facts
concerning all payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed "parachute
payments" to a "disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the Code in a
manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Parent and its counsel shall have the right to review
and comment on all documents to be delivered to the Shareholders in
connection with such vote. For purposes of clarity, only that portion of the
payments and/or benefits that is in excess of 2.99 times the applicable
individuals "base amount" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the
Code) need be submitted for a Shareholder vote, and subject to waiver, in
accordance with the provisions above.

filed, at the Securityholders cost and expense, all other Tax Returns of the

of Taxes reflected in the Final Closing Net Working Capital or could result in
a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall provide
the Representative with a copy of such Tax Returns for review and approval
(which will not be unreasonably withheld). The Representative shall be
entitled to review all such Tax Returns prior to filing, and may request
revisions to such Income Tax Returns so long as any requested revisions are
provided to Parent no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date on
which the Representative receives a copy of such Tax Return from Parent.
Parent and the Representative shall attempt to resolve, in good faith,

filed, at Parents cost and expense, all Tax Returns of the Company, the
Surviving Company and their Subsidiaries for any Tax year or period beginning
on or before and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "). If
the Companys Tax liability with respect to such Tax Returns attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date exceeds the
amount of Taxes reflected in the Final Closing Net Working Capital or could
result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, Parent
shall provide the Representative with a copy of such Income or other material
Tax Returns for review and reasonable approval. The Representative shall be
entitled to review all such Income or other material Tax Returns prior to
filing and may request revisions to any such Income or other material Tax
Return, so long as any requested revisions are provided to Parent no later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the Representative
received a copy of such Income or other material Tax Return from Parent.
Parent and the Representative shall attempt to resolve, in good faith, any
disagreements as to the treatment of any item on any Income or other material
Tax Return for a Straddle Period. For purposes of _Section 6.4(c)_, _Section
6.4(e)_ and _Section 8.2(a)(x)_, in the case of any Taxes that are payable
for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the
portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on
the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than any Tax imposed
upon or measured by net income or gross income (excluding any Tax based solely
on gross receipts) including any interest, penalty, or additions thereto,
whether disputed or not (" _Income Taxes_ "), be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date, and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and
(ii) in the case of any Income Tax, be deemed to be equal to the amount that
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. Any
credits relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on
the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
allocations described in this _Section 6.4(c)_ shall be made in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Company or the appropriate
Subsidiary of the Company, except for changes required by Law or fact. Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practices
of the Company, which shall be in accordance with applicable Law.

 

(d) The Representative and Parent agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon reasonable request, as promptly as practical, such
information (including reasonable electronic access to books and records, Tax
Returns and Tax filings) and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the
review or filing of any Tax Return, the conduct of any Tax audit, and for
the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any
Tax matter. The Representative and Parent shall cooperate with each other in
the conduct of any Tax audit or other Tax proceedings and each shall execute
and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are reasonably
necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section 6.4_. Any Tax audit or
other Tax proceeding shall be deemed to be a Third Person Claim subject to the
procedures set forth in  _Section 8.5_ of this Agreement.

(e) Parent shall be entitled to retain any Tax refund received; provided,
however, that Parent shall pay over to the Securityholders any Tax refund
received that is both (i) attributable to an overpayment of Taxes paid solely
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period in the
proportion allocated to the Securityholders under _Section 6.4(c)_ and (ii)
not reflected as an asset in the Final Closing Net Working Capital. Parent
shall pay any such refund within ten (10) Business Days after receipt to the
accounts designated by each Securityholders in its respective Letters of
Transmittal, or deliver to each Securityholder to the address set forth in its
respective Letter of Transmittal, such Securityholders allocable portion of
such refunds or credits in accordance with the allocations set forth in the
Spreadsheet. For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction in Taxes, whether by
way of refund or otherwise, attributable to the utilization of any Tax
Attribute in a Taxable period commencing after the Closing Date shall be
solely for the benefit of Parent. For purposes of this _Section 6.4_, if the
Tax, if any, paid by the Company to the California Board of Equalization with
respect to the California State Sales and Use Tax audit for the period of
July 2005 through June 2008 (the " _California Audit_ ") is less than
$190,795.29, then Parent shall pay such difference to the Representative
within ten (10) Business Days after the Company provides written notice
to Parent (with a copy to the Representative) of the final resolution of the

resolution.

 

(f) Except where an amendment is required by a Tax authority, Parent shall

the extent reasonably available, such information (including reasonable access
to books and records and affidavits with respect to changes of ownership of
the Securityholders (which shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, include the

Person, or the Representative or a Securityholder has incurred an Indemnified
Loss or reasonably anticipates incurring an Indemnified Loss and desires to
seek indemnification with respect thereto on behalf of a Shareholder
Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall give reasonably prompt written notice in accordance with
_Section 10.1_ to the Representative (if and to the extent that such claim
may be satisfied from the Indemnification Escrow Fund) or any other
indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") specifying the facts
constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of
the claim asserted; provided, however, that the right of a Person to be
indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give
such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby. In the event that Parent determines in good
faith that a Parent Indemnified Person is reasonably likely to
incur Indemnified Losses for which a Parent Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, or a Shareholder determines in good faith that such
Shareholder is reasonably likely to incur Indemnified Losses for which such
Shareholder Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder, a
Parent Indemnified Person or Shareholder Indemnified Persons, as the case may
be, shall be entitled to submit a claim for indemnification for reasonably
anticipated Indemnified Losses in advance of the actual incurrence by any
such Persons of the same, whether to preserve such Persons rights to assert a
claim prior to the expiration of an applicable survival period with regard to
the underlying matter, to preserve such Persons set-off rights or rights in
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or otherwise, but no such Person shall be
entitled to actually collect indemnification in respect of such claim unless
and until any such reasonably anticipated Indemnified Losses are actually
incurred (whether before or after any applicable survival period) by a Parent
Indemnified Person or Shareholder Indemnified Person, as the case may be.

 

8.5 _Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons_.

 

(a) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because
of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an Indemnified Person
hereunder (a " _Third Person_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is
actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the right of
a Person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third
Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice
unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.5_, the
Indemnifying Party shall then have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party (a " _Defense Notice_ ") within fifteen (15) Business Days
after receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, and using
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate,
contest, or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a " _Third Person
Claim_ "), provided that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally
acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify
the Persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person
Claim and to discharge any cost or expense arising out of such investigation,
contest or settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in
(but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own
counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to
avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party
so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to
look to the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of
defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give
the Defense Notice within said fifteen (15) Business Day period, (i) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have the control over said defense and
settlement of the subject claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party will cooperate
with and make available to the Indemnified Party such assistance and
materials as it may reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right at its expense to participate in the defense assisted by
counsel of its own choosing, and the Indemnifying Party, if it is required to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, will be liable for all costs and
settlement amounts paid or incurred in connection therewith.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice with
respect to such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15) Business Days after
receipt thereof and thereby elects to conduct the defense of the subject
claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have control over said
defense and, subject to the provisions set forth below, settlement of the
subject claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make
available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as it may
reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have the rights at
its expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own
choosing. In such an event, the Indemnifying Party will not settle the subject
claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless (i)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of
the rights of any Person; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the Indemnified
Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of
such Third Person Claims effected without its consent, in which cases
the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section
8.5_, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may
participate in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole
control, including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense or
settlement of any claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, (ii) that involves criminal allegations against the
Indemnified Party, (iii) that, if unsuccessful, (A) would set a precedent
that would materially interfere with, or have a material adverse effect on,
the business or financial condition of the Indemnified Party or (B) would
reasonably be expected to exceed the Parent Cap or the Shareholders Cap, as
applicable, in either case as mutually determined by the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party or, if such a determination is not made within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date on which the Indemnified Party
responds to the Defense Notice by asserting its rights under this _Section
8.5(c)_, in accordance with its reasonable judgment, or (iv) subject to clause
(iii)(B) above, that imposes liability on the part of the Indemnified Party
for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder.
In such event, the Indemnifying Party will still be subject to its obligations
hereunder but the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

8.6 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be
entitled to indemnification in respect of Indemnified Losses pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ unless and until such Indemnified Losses exceed Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) in the aggregate (the "
_Indemnification Threshold_ "), but then to the full extent of
such Indemnified Losses (including the first $500,000) of such Indemnified
Losses); provided, however, the Indemnification Threshold limitation shall not
apply in any manner whatsoever to the extent the breach results from fraud.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Shareholder Indemnified Persons shall not
be entitled to indemnification in respect of Indemnified Losses pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_ unless and until such Indemnified Losses exceed the
Indemnification Threshold, but then to the full extent of such Indemnified
Losses (including the first $500,000) of such Indemnified Losses);
provided, however, the Indemnification Threshold limitation shall not apply
in any manner whatsoever to the extent the breach results from fraud.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, in the absence of fraud, the aggregate amount
of Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons
under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ may not exceed an amount equal to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, plus Fifteen Percent (15%) of the aggregate
dollar value of any Earnout Consideration paid or payable by Parent pursuant
to and in accordance with _Section 1.13_ hereof (as adjusted, the " _General
Cap_ "). From and after the Closing, in the absence of fraud, the sole source
of recovery for indemnity claims by Parent Indemnified Persons under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ shall be the available balance in the Indemnification Escrow
Account and the right of Parent to offset against up to Fifteen Percent (15%)
of the aggregate dollar value of any Earnout Consideration paid or payable as
provided in _Section 8.6(k)_ unless and solely to the extent that the Parent
Indemnified Persons have previously recovered amounts from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund for any indemnification claims under Sections 8.2(a)(ii) 
8.2(a)(x), in which event Parent shall be entitled to recover an equivalent
amount directly from the Securityholders pursuant to their respective Side
Agreements or otherwise as permitted by Law (subject to the General Cap). From
and after the Closing, in the absence of fraud, the aggregate amount of
Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons
under _Section 8.2(a)(i)  8.2(a)(x)_ against each Securityholder may not
exceed an amount equal to such Securityholders Percentage multiplied by the
amount of each such indemnification claim (the " _Individual Cap_ ") (it being
understood and hereby agreed that if an indemnification claim by a Parent
Indemnified Person is payable from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, then the
Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover the full amount of
such claim from the Indemnification Escrow Fund and each Securityholder shall
contribute its respective Securityholders Percentage to such claim from its
interest in the Indemnification Escrow Fund). From and after the Closing, in
the absence of fraud, the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses that may be
recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons under _Section 8.2(a)(i) 
8.2(a)(x)_, inclusive, shall be an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
(the " _Aggregate Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the General
Cap, the Individual Cap nor the Aggregate Cap shall apply to the obligations
of any Securityholder under this _Article 8_ to the extent such breach results
from fraud by the Company or any such Securityholder prior to or at the
Closing (it being understood and hereby agreed that no Securityholder shall
be directly liable to any Parent Indemnified Person for any liability (other
than with respect to such Securityholders interest in the Indemnification
Escrow or pursuant to rights of setoff against such Securityholders interest
in the Earnout Consideration) resulting from or arising out of any fraud
committed by any other Securityholder (solely in its capacity as a
Securityholder and not as an officer, director or employee of the
Company), whether under such Securityholders Side Agreement with Parent or
otherwise under applicable Law; provided however, in the event of fraud by the
Company prior to or at the Closing, the Aggregate Cap shall be applicable and
Parent shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to promptly seek full
recovery of any such Loss from the Person or Persons responsible for such
fraud, if and only if the same is reasonably determinable by Parent; provided,
however, that the Parent Indemnified Person (including Parent) shall have no
obligation to first submit or to collect from the applicable Person(s) as a
precondition to making a claim (whether for indemnification or otherwise)
hereunder or obtaining indemnification or any other remedy for Losses
therefor, and the Parties hereto agree not to delay in any manner the payment
to Parent or any Parent Indemnified Person of such indemnification or remedy
based on Parents non-fulfillment of the foregoing obligation at the time
any such claim is made. To the extent that any amounts are actually recovered
from the applicable Person(s) who committed the fraud by a Parent Indemnified
Person after the related indemnification payment or other remedy has been made
pursuant to this Agreement by any Securityholder the Parent Indemnified
Person will pay over to the Indemnification Escrow Agent (to the extent that
(a) amounts have been paid to Parent out of the Indemnification Escrow Account
and (b) the Indemnification Escrow Agreement remains in effect) or to the
Exchange Agent (or, if the Exchange Agent is no longer engaged, to the Parent)
for distribution to the applicable Securityholders (in any other circumstance)
any such amounts promptly after they are actually recovered.

(d) From and after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses
that may be recovered by the Shareholder Indemnified Persons under _Section
8.3(a)_ may not exceed an amount equal to the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
subject to increase by Fifteen Percent (15%) of the aggregate dollar value of
any Earnout Consideration paid or payable by Parent in accordance with
_Section 1.13_ hereof (the " _Parent Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this _Section 8.6(d)_, (A) the Parent Cap shall not apply to
claims for indemnification arising out of any of the Parent Fundamental
Representations, and (B) the Parent Cap shall not apply to the obligations of
Parent if and to the extent a breach results from fraud. In addition, from and
after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses that may be
recovered by the Shareholder Indemnified Persons with respect to any claim
related to the earnout contemplated by _Section 1.13_ may not exceed an
amount equal to Twenty-Seven Million Six Hundred Forty-Two Thousand Dollars
($27,642,000.00).

(e) The Securityholders shall not have any claim for contribution from or
against the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the
Company or the Surviving Company as a result of any indemnification or other
payments made by (or on behalf of) any of the Securityholders to any of the
Parent Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement, the Side Agreement or any other agreement ancillary hereto.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary,
all "material" and "material adverse effect" or similar materiality type
qualifications contained in the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement shall be given full effect for purposes of determining whether
any such representations and warranties are inaccurate or have been breached
as of any particular time, but if and to the extent that a representation or
warranty set forth herein has been determined to be inaccurate or breached,
such materiality, material adverse effect and other similar materiality type
qualifications shall be ignored and not given any effect for purposes of
determining whether the Indemnification Thresholds have been surpassed and/or
determining the amount of any Indemnified Losses.

(g) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Parent or its representatives, of the Company or otherwise, shall in any way
limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim for
indemnification by Parent or any Parent Indemnified Person under or pursuant
to this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Side Agreement
or any other agreement ancillary hereto.

(h) In connection with an Indemnified Persons rights under this _Article 8_
in connection with any Third Person Claim, an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover all damages that are recovered by third parties in
connection with Losses suffered by the Indemnified Person. In connection with
an Indemnified Persons rights for any other claim under this Agreement (other
than for fraud), an Indemnified Person may not seek punitive, remote or
speculative damages and shall only be entitled to recover Losses that are
probable and reasonably foreseeable on the date of this Agreement.

(i) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided to any
Parent Indemnified Person under this _Article 8_ shall, from and after the
Closing, be adjusted to take into account (i) any reduction in Taxes actually
realized by the Parent Indemnified Person as a result of the Loss giving rise
to the payment or indemnity, and (ii) subject to _Section 8.2(c)_, any Taxes
that will be actually incurred by the Parent Indemnified Person with respect
to such payment or indemnity.

 

(j) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided to any
Parent Indemnified Person under this _Article 8_ shall, from and after the
Closing, be net of any amounts actually recovered under insurance policies
maintained by the Company in effect immediately prior to the Closing and
applicable to such Losses, net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
actually incurred by the Parent Indemnified Person in obtaining recovery.
Parent will use its commercially reasonably efforts to promptly seek full
recovery under the insurance policies referenced in the foregoing sentence;
provided, however, that the Parent Indemnified Person (including Parent)
shall have no obligation to first submit or to collect upon any applicable
insurance coverage as a precondition to making a claim for indemnification
hereunder or obtaining indemnification for Losses therefor, and the Parties
hereto agree, without limiting any other rights any Indemnifying Party may
have against Parent, not to delay in any manner the payment to Parent or any
Parent Indemnified Person of such indemnification based on Parents non-
fulfillment of the foregoing obligation at the time any such claim is made. To
the extent that any insurance payment is actually recovered by a Parent
Indemnified Person after the related indemnification payment has been made
pursuant to this Agreement; the Parent Indemnified Person will pay over to
the Indemnification Escrow Agent (to the extent that (a) amounts have been
paid to Parent out of the Indemnification Escrow Account and (b) the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement remains in effect) or to the Exchange Agent
(or, if the Exchange Agent is no longer engaged, to Parent) for distribution
to the applicable Securityholders (in any other circumstance) the amounts of
such insurance payments promptly after they are actually recovered. If
permitted under the terms of the applicable insurance policies, in lieu of the
foregoing, the Parent Indemnified Person may subrogate or assign its rights to
recover under such insurance policies to the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) or their designee.

(k) From and after the Closing, and without prejudice or limitation to any
other remedies available to the Parent, in the event that Parent or any
Parent Indemnified Person is entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent may set-off the amount of such indemnification claim against
any amounts of Earnout Consideration due under _Section 1.13_ (the "
_Remaining Payments_ "), subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section
8.6(k)_ and such set-off shall be allocated pro-rata for each Securityholder
among cash and Parent Common Stock in accordance with the percentage of
Parent Common Stock and cash to the total Earnout Consideration payable to
each such Securityholder, provided that such common stock shall be valued at
the Parent Common Stock Value. With respect to the right of Parent to set-off
any Earnout Consideration due under _Section 1.13_, Parent shall have the
right withhold any Earnout Shares or any cash portion of the Earnout
Consideration (in an amount equal to the amount to be set-off under this
_Section 8.6(k)_) from any Earnout Consideration due under _Section 1.13_.
In the event any Parent Indemnified Person has made a claim for
indemnification hereunder and any indemnifying Party disputes its obligation
to make such indemnification, Parent may nonetheless withhold, or cause to be
withheld, the amount of such Parent Indemnified Persons claimed
indemnification from the Remaining Payments until such dispute is resolved and
such withholding shall not be deemed a default by Parent hereunder.

(l) The Securityholders or Parent, as applicable, shall have no liability
with respect to any Indemnified Losses to the extent that Securityholders or
Parent, as applicable, received a credit on account of such Indemnified Losses
in determining an adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 1.10_ or with respect to any item for which there has been a Final
Determination in accordance with _Section 1.10_.

 

(m) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be deemed to restrict the
ability of the Indemnified Party to select the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement upon which to base any claim by such Indemnified Party,
including instances where more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement may have been breached or where the facts giving rise to any such
claim may constitute a breach under one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, but not another.

8.7  _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to the proviso below, from and after the
Effective Time, the rights to indemnification, set-off, compensation and
reimbursement set forth in or contemplated by this _Article 8_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of any Person (whether at law or in equity) with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the
foregoing shall in no way limit any rights or remedies of a Person under or
pursuant to the Side Agreements, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, any
Non-Competition and Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement entered
into in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby), and no Person
shall have any other claims, rights or remedies against any other Person
after the Closing Date, whether under this Agreement or under any applicable
Law or otherwise, except for the remedies of specific performance, injunction
and other equitable relief; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Person shall
be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, defenses, causes of action or
remedies (i) arising under federal or state securities laws, (ii) if and to
the extent such rights, claims, defenses, causes of action or remedies may
not be waived under applicable Law, or (iii) arising out of or based upon

Schedule 1.13(a)

 

Earnout Calculation



   1. | For purposes of this Agreement, " _Revenue_ " shall mean
consolidated revenue recognized by Parent, in accordance with United States
GAAP applied by Parent on a basis consistent with past practice, from sales
of monocrystalline prime ingot or prime slabbed ingot within the Earnout
Period (including sales to subsidiaries and other affiliates of Parent);
provided, however, that notwithstanding Parents application of United States
GAAP to the determination of "Revenue", "Revenue" for purposes hereof shall be
determined prior to any netting of the cost and associated markup of the poly
raw material used to produce the monocrystalline prime ingot or prime slabbed
ingot. Revenue shall be calculated as the product of (a) quantity (Kg) of
ingot shipped and (b) price of such ingot based on the purchase order
applicable thereto. With respect to such calculation relating to sales to
third parties, the same price per Kg that is used in the most recent
applicable purchase order (whether to SunPower or otherwise) for the price
should be used for purposes of the calculation (i.e., cropped Kg or slabbed
Kg, as applicable). 
---|--- 



   2. | For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Revenue Baseline_ " shall
be equal to $60,000,000. The " _Revenue Target_ " shall be equal
to $71,800,000. The " _Actual Revenue_ " shall be the dollar value of the
Revenue during the time period covered by such Earnout Statement, and shall be
the total amount of Revenue earned during the entire Earnout Period and not
the Revenue for any particular period during the Earnout Period. 
---|--- 



   3. | With respect to any Earnout Statement, if the Actual Revenue is in
excess of the Revenue Baseline, then the Preliminary Earnout Consideration
shall be an amount in cash and shares of Parent Common, as determined in
accordance with this Agreement and the Earnout Escrow Agreement, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) $27,642,000 and (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the lesser of (i) applicable Actual Revenue and (ii)
71,800,000, and the denominator of which is 71,800,000, _less_ any amount of
Earnout Consideration previously paid or payable to the Stockholders
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such Earnout Consideration that
may have been payable but was not paid as a result of the exercise of set-off
rights of Parent under the Merger Agreement). 
---|--- 



   4. | In the event that during the Earnout Period, Parent causes the
Surviving Company to sell in another product form factor or type and/or in
combination with other products of Parent or Parents Subsidiaries, such as
monocrystalline wafers (" _Wafers_ "), instead of monocrystalline prime ingot
or prime slabbed ingot, the Parties hereto agree that the conversion factor of
revenue from the sale of Wafers into "Revenue" for the purposes of
determining the "Actual Revenue" shall be a product equal to (a) the quantity
(in Kg) of ingot shipped to be converted into Wafers and (b) the price of the
most recent similar sale (based on specifications, customer requirements,
etc.) to a third party of moncrystalline prime ingot or prime slabbed ingot.
In the event that during the Earnout Period Parent causes the Surviving
Company to sell monocrystalline prime ingot or prime slabbed ingot in a form
or manner other than as monocrystalline prime ingot, prime slabbed ingot or
Wafers, Parent agrees to negotiate in good faith with the Representative to
establish a mutually acceptable revenue conversion factor to apply to revenue
derived from the sale of any such products.

Schedule 1.13(g)

 

Dispute Resolution



   (a) | _Disputes_. In the event any dispute arises between the
Representative and Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries which expressly includes
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries and the respective successors and
assigns of each of the foregoing) (each an " _Earnout Party_ ") in connection
with the Earnout, any Earnout Statement or any of the covenants, agreements or
calculations set forth on this Schedule 1.13(g), the Earnout Parties agree
that such dispute will be resolved as follows: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | _Mediation_. The Earnout Parties shall first attempt to
resolve the dispute by themselves through the participation in such endeavor
of the Executive Vice President  Solar Materials of Parent and the
Representatives. In the event that the Earnout Parties are unable to resolve
such dispute themselves within ten (10) Business Days from when an Earnout
Party has provided notice to the other Earnout Parties of such dispute (the "
_Initial Period_ "), then, within three (3) Business Days following the end of
the Initial Period, the Earnout Parties shall submit the dispute to non-
binding mediation through a neutral mediator selected by mutual agreement. In
the event that the Earnout Parties are unable to resolve such dispute by
mediation within fifteen (15) Business Days following such submission (the "
_Mediation Period_ "), unless the Earnout Parties mutually agree to extend
the Mediation Period at the conclusion of the initial period, such dispute
shall be resolved by binding arbitration as set forth below. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | _Rules_. Except as expressly provided herein to the
contrary, the arbitration proceeding shall be conducted under the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the
time a demand for arbitration is made. To the extent that there is any
conflict between the rules of the American Arbitration Association and this
Schedule 1.13(g), this Schedule 1.13(g) shall govern and determine the rights
of the Earnout Parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | _Location; Selection of Arbitrators_. The arbitration
will take place in Palo Alto, California (or such other place as the Earnout
Parties shall mutually agree), before a single arbitrator, which arbitrator
shall have experience in matters and industries relevant to such dispute;
_provided, however_ that if the amount in controversy exceeds $10 million,
then either the Parent or the Representatives shall have the right to require
that three arbitrators be used. In the event that the Earnout Parties cannot
agree on a single arbitrator within five (5) Business Days following the end
of the Mediation Period, then the arbitrator shall be selected as follows:
either Earnout Party may request the American Arbitration Association to
provide a list of at least five (5), but no more than nine (9) proposed
arbitrators, all of whom must be retired judges with at least ten (10) years
of judicial experience, but who may still be active in the practice of law;
_provided_ that any such prospective arbitrator shall have experience in
earnout matters relevant to such dispute. If the Earnout Parties are unable
to mutually select an arbitrator from such list, the Earnout Parties to such
dispute shall then take turns crossing off the names one at a time until one
name remains, who shall thereupon be appointed the arbitrator. The Earnout
Parties to such dispute shall select by lot which of them strikes the first
name from the list of proposed arbitrators. If the person selected in this
method to be the arbitrator declines or is otherwise unavailable to serve as
the arbitrator of the dispute, the arbitrator shall be selected from the same
list of proposed arbitrators selected in the reverse order to which those
proposed arbitrators names were struck from the list until one of those
individuals elected to be the arbitrator accepts the appointment and is able
to serve as the arbitrator.

manner set forth herein (the " _Arbitrator_ ") shall be requested to honor the
intention of the Earnout Parties hereto to resolve the dispute quickly and in

All decisions shall be made with this intention in mind. The decision of the
Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all Earnout Parties, their

have the right to retain a nationally recognized accounting firm to aid in the
Arbitrators consideration of the dispute which accounting firm must be
reasonably acceptable to both Earnout Parties. The Arbitrator shall be
required to determine all issues in accordance with California law. The
