Account Waiver</U></FONT>. Each of the Companies and the Holder acknowledges that Acquiror is a blank check company with the powers
and privileges to effect a Business Combination. Each of the Companies and the Holder further acknowledges that, as described
in the prospectus dated September 15, 2017 (the &ldquo;<U>Prospectus</U>&rdquo;) available at www.sec.gov, substantially all of
Acquiror assets consist of the cash proceeds of Acquiror&rsquo;s initial public offering and private placements of its securities
and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a the trust account for the benefit of Acquiror, certain of its
public stockholders and the underwriters of Acquiror&rsquo;s initial public offering (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Account</U>&rdquo;).
Each of the Companies and the Holder acknowledges that it has been advised by Acquiror that, except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to Acquiror to pay its franchise Tax, income Tax and similar obligations,
the Trust Agreement provides that cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) if Acquiror completes the transactions which
constitute a Business Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts as described in the Prospectus; (ii) if Acquiror
fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement,
to Acquiror in limited amounts to permit Acquiror to pay the costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and then to
Acquiror&rsquo;s public stockholders; and (iii) if Acquiror holds a shareholder vote to amend Acquiror&rsquo;s amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of the obligation to redeem 100% of Acquiror Common Shares
if Acquiror fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period, then for the redemption of any Acquiror
Common Shares properly tendered in connection with such vote. For and in consideration of Acquiror entering into this Agreement,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of the Companies and the Holder hereby irrevocably waives any
right, title, interest or claim of any kind they have or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account and agree
not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement
and any negotiations, Contracts or agreements with Acquiror; <U>provided </U>that (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit
the Companies&rsquo; and the Holder&rsquo;s right to pursue a claim against Acquiror for legal relief against monies or other
assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation
of the transactions (including a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement and cause the
disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to the Acquiror Share Redemptions)
to the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect Acquiror&rsquo;s
ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Acquiror Share Redemptions, or for fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve
to limit or prohibit any claims that the Companies and the Holder may have in the future against Acquiror&rsquo;s assets or funds
that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account and any assets that
have been purchased or acquired with any such funds).</P>
