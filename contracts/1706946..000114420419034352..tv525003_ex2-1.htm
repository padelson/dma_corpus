selected by the SCH Designated Directors and the Holder (the " _Auditor_ ").
All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne by the Holder and Acquiror

Acquiror. The Allocation as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 3.4_
shall be the " _Final Allocation_."

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise required pursuant to a "final determination"

foreign Law, the Holder and Acquiror shall (and shall cause their respective

inconsistent with the Final Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or in any
proceeding relating to Taxes. In the event that a Governmental Authority
disputes the Final Allocation, the party receiving notice of such dispute
shall promptly notify the other party, and Holder and Acquiror shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to defend such Final Allocation in any applicable proceeding.

Affiliates to) apportion any item treated as an adjustment to the

Authority any additional information required to be filed under applicable
Law.

funded or fully insured, is fully funded or fully insured, including any
back-service obligations, on an ongoing and termination or solvency basis

Section 6.6 _Internal Controls; Listing; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Except as not required in reliance on exemptions from various
reporting requirements by virtue of Acquiror's status as an "emerging growth
company" within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (" _JOBS Act_ "), Acquiror has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that material information relating to Acquiror,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, if any, is made known to Acquiror's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Acquiror's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in Acquiror's periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act. Since September 13, 2017, Acquiror has established and
maintained a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Acquiror's financial
reporting and the preparation of Acquiror's financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP.

the SEC on a timely basis all statements required by Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Acquiror
has not taken any action prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(c) Since September 13, 2017, Acquiror has complied in all material
respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "). The Acquiror
Class A Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange
Act and is listed for trading on the NYSE. There is no Legal Proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror by the
NYSE or the SEC with respect to any intention by such entity to deregister
the Acquiror Class A Common Stock or prohibit or terminate the listing of
Acquiror Class A Common Stock on the NYSE.

Exchange Act) or director of Acquiror. Acquiror has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(f) Neither Acquiror (including any employee thereof) nor Acquiror's
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by Acquiror, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
Acquiror's management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of

or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

Section 6.8 _Trust Account_. As of the date of this Agreement,
Acquiror has at least $708,000,000 in the Trust Account (including, if

promulgated under the Investment Company Act pursuant to the Investment
Management Trust Agreement, dated as of September 13, 2017, between Acquiror
and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as trustee (the " _Trustee_ ")
(the " _Trust Agreement_ "). There are no separate Contracts, side letters or
other arrangements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express
or implied) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the
Acquiror SEC Filings to be inaccurate or that would entitle any Person (other
than shareholders of Acquiror holding Acquiror Common Shares sold in
Acquiror's initial public offering who shall have elected to redeem their
shares of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the Acquiror Governing Documents
and the underwriters of Acquiror's initial public offering with respect to
deferred underwriting commissions) to any portion of the proceeds in the
Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust
Account may be released other than to pay Taxes and payments with respect to
all Acquiror Share Redemptions. There are no proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of Acquiror, threatened with respect to the Trust Account. Acquiror
has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date
under, and is not in default, breach or delinquent in performance or any other
respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no
event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default or breach thereunder. As of the Effective Time, the
obligations of Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to the Acquiror
Governing Documents shall terminate, and as of the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to the Acquiror Governing
Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of Acquiror by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. To Acquiror's knowledge,
as of the date hereof, following the Effective Time, no Acquiror Shareholder
shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the
extent such Acquiror Shareholder is exercising an Acquiror Share Redemption.
As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Companies contained herein and the compliance by the
Companies and the Holder with their respective obligations hereunder, neither
Acquiror or Merger Subs have any reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the use of funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds
available in the Trust Account will not be available to Acquiror and Merger
Subs on the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.9 _Investment Company Act; JOBS Act_. Acquiror is not an
"investment company" or a Person directly or indirectly "controlled" by or

perform their obligations under this Agreement and (b) except as set forth in

accrued or unaccrued, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, or due or
to become due), except for liabilities and obligations (i) reflected or
reserved for on the financial statements or disclosed in the notes thereto
included in Acquiror SEC Filings or (ii) that have arisen since the date of

waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
(provided, that, in the case of any insured arrangements, subject to the

under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Closing, and (ii) fully credit each
Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, co-payments and other out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her

the Incentive Equity Plan in accordance with the general terms set forth on

shall not be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code, and
prior to the Closing Date, the Companies shall deliver to Acquiror evidence
satisfactory to Acquiror that (i) a shareholder vote was held in conformance

shareholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or
benefits that were subject to the shareholder vote (the " _280G Approval_ ")

such "parachute payments" shall not be made or provided, pursuant to waivers
of those payments and/or benefits which were executed by the affected
individuals prior to the date the payments and/or benefits were submitted to
the shareholders for approval. If no payments and/or benefits could
constitute "parachute payments" in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then the 280G Approval shall not be required
to be held.

its Affiliates shall be entitled to purchase, or arrange for the purchase by
third Persons of, additional shares of Acquiror Common Stock at a price
per share of $10.00 in an aggregate amount such that the Available Acquiror
Cash is, at or immediately prior to the Closing, equal to at least

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving
Companies agree that they shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the (x) Companies and each of their respective
Subsidiaries (in each case, solely to the extent acting in their capacity as
such and to the extent such activities are related to the business of the
Companies being acquired under this Agreement) (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ ") and (y) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries (the " _Acquiror
Indemnified Parties_ " together with the Company Indemnified Parties, the " _D
andO Indemnified Parties_") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Companies, Acquiror or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
would have been permitted under applicable Law and its respective certificate
of incorporation, certificate of formation, bylaws, limited liability company
agreement or other organizational documents in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify such DandO Indemnified Parties (including the advancing
of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Companies and their Subsidiaries to (i) maintain for a
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time provisions in its
certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation, bylaws, limited
liability company agreement and other organizational documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Surviving Companies' and their Subsidiaries' former
and current officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less
favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation, certificate of formation, bylaws, limited liability company
agreement, operating agreement and other organizational documents of the
Companies, Acquiror or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each
case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not amend, repeal or

Companies and their Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this
_Section 8.9_.

shall cause the Surviving Companies to maintain in effect directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered
by Acquiror, the Companies' or their Subsidiaries' directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have
been heretofore made available to Acquiror or its agents or representatives)
on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage, except that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay an annual
premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium
payable by Acquiror or the Companies, as applicable, for such insurance
policy for the year ended December 31, 2018; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) Acquiror or the Surviving Companies may cause coverage to be extended
under the current directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a
six-year "tail" policy containing terms not materially less favorable than
the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is
asserted or made within such six-year period, any insurance required to be
maintained under this _Section 8.9_ shall be continued in respect of such
claim until the final disposition thereof.

Surviving Companies. In the event that Acquiror or any of the Surviving
Companies or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Acquiror and the Surviving Companies shall
ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Acquiror or any of the Surviving Companies, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this  _Section 8.9_.

  



  

(d) On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall enter into customary
indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to each of the Holder and
Acquiror with the post-Closing directors and officers of Acquiror, which
indemnification agreements shall continue to be effective following the
Closing.

the Effective Time, Acquiror will keep current and timely file all reports
required to be filed or furnished with the SEC and otherwise comply in all
material respects with its reporting obligations under applicable Laws.

Companies and their Subsidiaries)), and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, counsel, accountants, consultants, agents and other
representatives (collectively, the " _Holder Indemnified Persons_ ") from and
against any losses, damages, liabilities, Taxes, judgments and other costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees) (collectively, " _Damages_ ")
arising from or relating to the Amended and Restated Deed of Guarantee, dated
September 2, 2014 (the " _Guarantee_ "), between Virgin Holdings Limited and
Virgin Galactic, LLC, including any claim or demand for payment made on any
Holder Indemnified Person under the Guarantee, in each case to the extent such

Section 9.3 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any
covenant contained in _Article VII_ or _Article VIII_ , Acquiror, the Holder
and the Companies shall each, and shall each cause their respective
Subsidiaries to (a) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all material
consents and approvals of third parties that any of Acquiror, the Holder, the
Companies, or their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to
consummate the Mergers and (b) take such other action as may be reasonably
necessary or as another party hereto may reasonably request to satisfy the
conditions of _Article X_ or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no action taken by
the Holder or the Companies under this _Section 9.3_ will constitute a breach
of _Section 7.1_.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Section 1445 Withholding Matters_.

  



  

(i) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Holder
shall submit an application to the IRS for a certificate under
Treasury Regulations, Section 1.445-3 providing that (x) no withholding is
required by Acquiror under Section 1445 of the Code in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) seeking an early
refund of any amounts required to be withheld in the event no such
certificate is obtained prior to the Closing (a " _Section 1445 Certificate_
").

Section 1445 Certificate to Acquiror at least five (5) days prior to
submitting such application to the IRS for Acquiror's review and comment and
Holder shall incorporate all of Acquiror's reasonable comments in good faith.

  



  

(iii) The Holder shall keep Acquiror informed of the status of such
application and any correspondence with the IRS relating to such

(iv) In the event a valid Section 1445 Certificate completely
exempting any and all withholding under Section 1445 of the Code
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
obtained by Holder and delivered to Acquiror prior to the Closing, Holder
shall pay to Acquiror the maximum amount that Acquiror may be required to
withhold under Section 1445 of the Code in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any such amounts relating to
the Pre-Closing Restructuring) with respect to any "United States real
property interests" as such term is defined in Section 897 of the Code owned
by the Company LLC, consistent with the Allocation and Exhibit H (the "
_Potential Section 1445 Withholding Amount_ "). Acquiror shall hold such
Potential Section 1445 Withholding Amount in escrow until the actual amount
of required withholding under Section 1445 of the Code is determined (the "
_Actual Section 1445 Withholding Amount_ ," which may be upon the issuance by
the IRS of a valid Section 1445 Certificate).

  



    

 | 84| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v) Upon determination of the Actual Section 1445 Withholding Amount,
Acquiror shall remit any such amount that is due to the IRS in
accordance with applicable Law and shall pay the excess of the Potential
Section 1445 Withholding Amount over the Actual Section 1445
Withholding Amount over to Holder.

  



  

(b) Acquiror, the Companies and the Holder shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to reasonably
cooperate, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any Legal
Proceeding regarding Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Taxes with respect to a taxable period that begins on or before the Closing
Date and ends after the Closing Date of the Companies and their Subsidiaries.
Such Tax Returns referred to in the preceding sentence shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practices of the Companies and their Subsidiaries
unless otherwise required by applicable Law or as mutually determined by
the Holder and Acquiror. Such cooperation shall include the retention of and
(upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Legal Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the
provision of such powers of attorney as may be necessary to allow for the
filing of Tax Returns or the control of any Legal Proceedings relating to
Taxes.

  



  

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes, fees and costs (including any
associated penalties and interest) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall constitute Transaction Expenses, except
as otherwise provided in the definition of Transaction Expenses.

  



  

(d) _Combined Reporting and Returns_.

  



  

(i) To the extent the Acquiror is required to or elects to file a
combined, unitary or consolidated state Tax Return with the Holder, the
Holder shall prepare or cause to be prepared, at the Holder's expense, all
such combined, unitary or consolidated state Tax Returns and shall be
entitled to make any elections or determinations with respect to such Tax
Returns only with the prior written consent of Acquiror, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. At least ten days prior to the
due date for any such combined, unitary or consolidated Tax Return, the
Holder shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to Acquiror for Acquiror's
review and comment. The Holder shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments that Acquiror submits to the Holder no less than five days prior to
the due date of such Tax Return. In accordance with applicable Law, the
parties shall have such Tax Returns as prepared by the Holder (reflecting
Acquiror's reasonable comments) executed and timely filed.

  



    

 | 85| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) To the extent the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is
included in any combined, unitary or consolidated state Tax Return with
the Holder or any of its Affiliates, (i) the Holder shall take no action with
respect to any item reported on such Tax Return that could reasonably be
expected to materially impact the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, without obtaining the prior written consent of Acquiror, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, (ii) if the Holder
or any of its Affiliates utilize any Tax attributes generated after Closing
that would not have been utilized by the Holder or its Affiliates had the
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries not been included in such applicable Tax
Return, the Holder shall appropriately compensate the Acquiror for the use of
such Tax attributes as mutually agreed to by the Holder and Acquiror, (iii) to
the extent the Holder receives any Tax refund or Tax credit properly
attributable to the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries, the Holder
shall promptly pay the amount of any such Tax refund or Tax credit over to
the Acquiror, and (iv) the Holder and its Affiliates shall hold the Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries harmless from any Tax liability of any Person included in
any such Tax Return other than the Acquiror or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the covenants of this _Section 9.4_ shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to valid extensions).

  



  

Section 9.5 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Companies and Acquiror shall take all such steps as may be
required (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any
dispositions of the Company Interests or acquisitions of Acquiror Common
Shares (including, in each case, securities deliverable upon exercise, vesting
or settlement of any derivative securities) resulting from the transactions
contemplated hereby by each individual who may become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby to be exempt under Rule B-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Wrong Pockets; Remaining Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) From time to time following the Closing, (i) the Holder and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) shall
transfer to the Companies or their designated Subsidiary any asset or
liability substantially exclusively used in the business of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries as conducted on the Closing Date that was inadvertently not
transferred to the Companies (directly or indirectly through any of their
Subsidiaries) prior to Closing (including in the Pre-Closing Restructuring)
(such liabilities referred to in this clause (i), the " _Company Liabilities_
") and (ii) Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including, from and after the
Closing, the Companies and their Subsidiaries) shall transfer to Holder or its
designated Affiliate any asset or liability substantially exclusively used in
the business of Holder or its Affiliates (other than the Companies and their

transferred to the Companies (directly or indirectly through any of
their Subsidiaries) prior to Closing (including in the Pre-Closing
Restructuring) and any liability set forth on _Schedule 9.6(a)_  of the
Company Disclosure Letter (such liabilities referred to in this clause (ii),
the " _Holder Liabilities_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, cash and cash
equivalents, along with any other asset, liability or service, the transfer or
provision of which is addressed in the TMLA, the Transition Services
Agreements or otherwise in this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated hereby, shall not be subject to this _Section 9.6(a)_.

Subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing, the Companies and their
Subsidiaries), as applicable, in each case, in respect of any
loss, liability, fine, penalty, cost or expense (including reasonable legal
expenses and costs (including costs of investigation)) which such Person has
actually paid in respect of any Holder Liabilities; _provided_ that each of
Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing, the
Companies and their Subsidiaries), as applicable, shall have first provided
reasonable notice to the Holder and its Affiliates (other than the Companies
and their Subsidiaries) of the existence of such Holder Liabilities and a
reasonable period of time to transfer or defend against, as applicable, such
Holder Liabilities, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Holder and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) in connection
with such transfer or defense, prior to the payment of such Holder
Liabilities.

  



  

(c) The Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including, from and after the

and its Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), as

cost or expense (including reasonable legal expenses and costs (including
costs of investigation)) which such Person has actually paid to a third party

Subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing, the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) of the existence of such Company Liabilities and a reasonable
period of time to transfer or defend against, as applicable, such Company
Liabilities, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Acquiror and its

Section 9.7 _Insurance Coverage_

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 9.7(c)_ and _Section 9.7(d),_ (i) from and
after the Closing, the Companies and their Subsidiaries shall cease to be
insured by Holder's and its Affiliates' (excluding the Companies' and their
Subsidiaries') insurance policies or by any of their respective self-
insurance programs and (ii) Holder and its Affiliates shall retain all
rights to control the Available Post-Closing Holder Insurance Policies.

  



  

(b) Holder shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (excluding the
Companies' and their Subsidiaries') to, (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts in the ordinary course of business to maintain the
coverage provided to the Companies and their Subsidiaries through
Holder's and its Affiliates' third-party insurance policies (or substantially
similar third-party coverage) (the " _Holder Insurance Policies_ "), in full
force and effect until the Closing, and (ii) prior to the Closing, report to
the applicable third-party insurance provider under each such applicable
Holder Insurance Policy events, acts, errors, accidents, omissions,
incidents, injuries or other forms of occurrences to the extent relating to
the Companies, their Subsidiaries or the properties, assets,
operations, employees, officers or directors of the Companies or any Company
Subsidiary that, in each case, occur prior to the Closing and are potentially
covered by an occurrence-based Holder Insurance Policy (collectively, the "
_Pre-Closing Occurrences_ ") that Holder becomes aware of prior to the
Closing in accordance with Holder's standard risk management practices and
applicable Holder Insurance Policy requirements in the ordinary course of
business.

  



    

 | 87| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, solely with respect to the
Holder Insurance Policies set forth on _Section 9.7(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Available Post-Closing Holder Insurance
Policies_ "), (i) Holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to report
in good faith to the applicable third-party insurance provider all Pre-Closing
Occurrences reasonably requested by Acquiror and otherwise reasonably
cooperate with Acquiror to reasonably ensure that applicable claim reporting
and other applicable material Available Post-Closing Holder Insurance Policy
requirements are met, in each case with respect to Pre-Closing Occurrences,
(ii) Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the
terms of the applicable Available Post-Closing Holder Insurance Policy to the
extent Holder has reasonably informed Acquiror in writing of such terms
reasonably in advance of the time necessary to comply with such terms, (iii)
Acquiror shall be fully liable for all uninsured or self-insured amounts
in respect of any Pre-Closing Occurrence, and (iv) Holder shall, and shall
cause its applicable Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the benefit of the applicable insurance coverage under any applicable
Available Post-Closing Holder Insurance Policy and pay such benefit to
Acquiror, net of (x) any deductibles, co-payments, premium increases (to the
extent attributable directly to the applicable benefit to Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries) or other reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses, if any) reasonably
incurred by Holder and its Affiliates in seeking such insurance proceeds and
(y) any Taxes imposed on Holder or its Affiliates in respect of the receipt or
accrual of such insurance proceeds (clauses (x) and (y), " _Recovery Costs_
"); _provided_ , that if the Recovery Costs are greater than the
applicable benefit payable to Acquiror, Acquiror shall promptly reimburse
Holder and its Subsidiaries for such difference. After the Closing, Holder
and its Affiliates may release, commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate
(whether in whole or in part) any insurance coverage, except Holder and its
Affiliates may not release, commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate any
applicable Available Post-Closing Holder Insurance Policies with respect to
any such Pre-Closing Occurrences.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding  _Section 9.7(c)_ to the contrary, with respect
to each known Pre-Closing Occurrence as of the Closing and each reported Pre-
Closing Occurrence as of the Closing, in each case potentially covered by a
third-party claims-made insurance policy of Holder or its
Affiliates (excluding the Companies and their Subsidiaries) (excluding, for
clarity, but subject to _Section 9.7(f)_ , any health insurance policies)
(each such policy, a " _Holder Claims-Made Policy_ " and each such claim, a "
_Covered Known Claim_ "), Holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to obtain insurance coverage for such Covered Known Claim
under the Holder Claims-Made Policies as though such Holder Claims-Made
Policy were an Available Post-Closing Holder Insurance Policy, mutatis
mutandis (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to netting and
reimbursement of Recovery Costs); provided that the last sentence of _Section
9.7(c)_ shall only apply with respect to a Holder Claims-Made Policy to the
extent related to Covered Known Claims (and no other claims). For purposes of
the immediately preceding sentence, "known" shall mean that Holder's Risk
Management Department has received written notice of the applicable event or
occurrence, including from a third party or Governmental Authority, or
otherwise has actual knowledge of facts and circumstances, in each case, at a
sufficient level of detail that would cause a reasonable person with
experience in the insurance industry to assume an insurable event
or occurrence has transpired.

  



    

 | 88| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Holder agrees that any cash proceeds received by Holder or any
of its Affiliates prior to the Closing in respect of Pre-Closing
Occurrences under any Holder Insurance Policies shall be paid to Acquiror at
the Closing to the extent such proceeds are required by Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries to restore or replace the assets affected by the applicable
Pre-Closing Occurrence, and excluding (i) any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Holder or its Affiliates in pursuing
such claims and (ii) any Taxes imposed on Holder or its Affiliates in respect
of the receipt or accrual of such recoveries.

  



  

(f) Subject to _Section 9.7(d)_ , from and after the Closing, the
Companies shall determine the manner to cover events, acts, errors,
accidents, omissions, incidents, injuries or other forms of occurrences to
the extent relating to the Companies, their Subsidiaries or the properties,
assets, operations, employees, officers or directors of the Companies or any
Subsidiary thereof that, in each case, occurred prior to the Closing and were
(prior to the Closing) potentially covered by a Holder Claims-Made Policy,
including Acquiror's or the Companies' purchase of a "tail policy" to such
Holder Claims-Made Policy or Holder's purchase of a "tail policy" or
endorsement to such Holder Claims-Made Policy; provided that the cost of such
purchase shall be paid by Acquiror after the Closing.

  



  

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 9.7_ shall require Holder or
any of its Affiliates to threaten or initiate any Legal Proceeding in
connection with its or their obligations hereunder; _provided_ that the Holder
and its Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with the Companies (at the
Companies sole cost and expense) in any Legal Proceeding with a third party
insurer.

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

Section 13.1 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Companies and the
Holder acknowledges that Acquiror is a blank check company with the
powers and privileges to effect a Business Combination. Each of the Companies
and the Holder further acknowledges that, as described in the prospectus
dated September 15, 2017 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at www.sec.gov,
substantially all of Acquiror assets consist of the cash proceeds of
Acquiror's initial public offering and private placements of its
securities and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a
the trust account for the benefit of Acquiror, certain of its public
stockholders and the underwriters of Acquiror's initial public offering (the "
_Trust Account_ "). Each of the Companies and the Holder acknowledges that it
has been advised by Acquiror that, except with respect to interest earned on
the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to Acquiror to pay
its franchise Tax, income Tax and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement
provides that cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) if Acquiror
completes the transactions which constitute a Business Combination, then to
those Persons and in such amounts as described in the Prospectus; (ii) if
Acquiror fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time
period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to
Acquiror in limited amounts to permit Acquiror to pay the costs and expenses
of its liquidation and dissolution, and then to Acquiror's public
stockholders; and (iii) if Acquiror holds a shareholder vote to amend
Acquiror's amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to
modify the substance or timing of the obligation to redeem 100% of Acquiror
Common Shares if Acquiror fails to complete a Business Combination within the
allotted time period, then for the redemption of any Acquiror Common Shares
properly tendered in connection with such vote. For and in consideration of
Acquiror entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, each of the Companies and the Holder hereby
irrevocably waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they have
or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account and
agree not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed
therefrom as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and any
negotiations, Contracts or agreements with Acquiror; _provided_ that (x)
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Companies' and the
Holder's right to pursue a claim against Acquiror for legal relief against
monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation of
the transactions (including a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its
obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of
the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to the Acquiror
Share Redemptions) to the Holder in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect
Acquiror's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Acquiror Share
Redemptions, or for fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit any claims that the Companies and the Holder may have in the future
against Acquiror's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account
(including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account and any
assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds).

proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 13.14 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable

breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specific enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in
equity. In the event that any Action shall be brought in equity to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each
party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law, and
each party agrees to waiver any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection therewith.

Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP) that represented Acquiror, the SCH
Designated Directors and/or the Sponsor prior to the Closing may represent
the SCH Designated Directors and/or the Sponsor in such dispute even though
the interests of the SCH Designated Directors and/or the Sponsor may be
directly adverse to the Acquiror, and even though such counsel may have
represented Acquiror in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for Acquiror, the SCH Designated
Directors and/or the Sponsor. Acquiror, the Companies and the Holder further
agree that, as to all legally privileged communications prior to the Closing
between or among any legal counsel (including Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP) that represented Acquiror, the SCH Designated Directors and/or
Sponsor prior to the Closing and any one or more such Persons that relate in
any way to the transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney/client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the SCH
Designated Directors and may be controlled by such SCH Designated Directors,
and shall not pass to or be claimed or controlled by Acquiror (after giving
effect to the Closing), the Companies and the Holder; _provided_ that the SCH
Designated Directors shall not waive such attorney/client privilege other
than to the extent they determine appropriate in connection with the
enforcement or defense of their respective rights or obligations existing
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
privileged communications or information shared by the Companies prior to the
Closing with Acquiror, the Sponsor or the SCH Designated Directors (in any
capacity) under a common interest agreement shall remain the privileged
communications or information of the Surviving Companies.

Acquiror, on the other hand, any legal counsel (including Latham and Watkins
LLP) that represented the Holder Designated Directors and/or the Holder prior
to the Closing may represent the Holder Designated Directors and/or the
Holder in such dispute even though the interests of the Holder Designated
Directors and/or the Holder may be directly adverse to the Acquiror and/or
the Companies, and even though such counsel may have represented Acquiror
and/or the Companies in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for Acquiror, the Companies, the Holder
Designated Directors and/or the Holder. Acquiror and the Companies further
agree that, as to all legally privileged communications prior to the Closing
between or among any legal counsel (including Latham and Watkins LLP) that
represented the Companies, the Holder Designated Directors and/or the Holder
prior to the Closing and any one or more such Persons that relate in any way
to the transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney/client privilege and

by Acquiror (after giving effect to the Closing) or the Companies; _provided_
that the Holder and/or the Holder Designated Directors shall not waive such
attorney/client privilege other than to the extent they determine appropriate
in connection with the enforcement or defense of their respective rights or
obligations existing under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
privileged communications or information shared by Acquiror prior to the

under a common interest agreement shall remain the privileged communications
