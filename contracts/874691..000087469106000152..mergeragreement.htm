of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to  enter
into this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the Merger, 
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and  each of the Special Committee and the Board of Directors has, as of the
date  of  this Agreement, approved and adopted this Agreement in accordance
with the  DGCL,  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and  recommended its approval and adoption by the
stockholders of the  Company;

 

 

WHEREAS,  the board of directors of Merger Sub has approved and adopted this
Agreement  and  approved the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

WHEREAS,  Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations,  warranties and agreements specified in this Agreement in
connection with this  Agreement.

 

 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties  and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound  hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

 

 

**ARTICLE  I**

 

 



 

 

THE  MERGER

 

 

Section  1.1. _The  Merger_.  At the  Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this  Agreement, and in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger  Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate  existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the  surviving corporation
in the Merger (the " _Surviving  Corporation_ ")  and a  wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

 

 

**Section  1.2.** _Closing_.  The  closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
")  shall  take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51
West 52nd  Street, New York, New York at 9:00 a.m., local time, on a date to
be specified  by the parties (the " _Closing  Date_ ")  which  shall be no
later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver  (to the
extent

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted  by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than  those  conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject  to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions)
(the " _Satisfaction  Date_ "),  or at  such other place, date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree in writing;  _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that if  the Marketing Period has not ended by the Satisfaction Date, the

the earliest to  occur  of (a) a date during the Marketing Period to be
specified by Parent on no  less  than three business days' notice to the
Company, (b) the final day of the  Marketing Period, and (c) if the Core

filings  or  recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger  shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of

or at such later time  as  the parties shall agree and as shall be set forth
in the Certificate of Merger  (such time as the Merger becomes effective, the
" _Effective  Time_ ").

Corporation_.

of the corporation is  OSI Restaurant Partners, Inc."

 

 

(b) The  bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time, in a form
reasonably  acceptable to the Special Committee, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving  Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  of this Agreement and applicable Law, in each case consistent
with the  obligations set forth in Section 5.9.

**ARTICLE  II**

 

 



 

 

CONVERSION  OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 

Section  2.1. _Effect  on Capital Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the Company,
Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or  Merger Sub:

 

 

(a) _Conversion  of Company Common Stock_.  Subject  to Sections 2.1(b),
2.1(d), 2.1(e) and 5.5(a)(iii), each issued and outstanding  share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time (such shares, collectively, " _Company  Common
Stock,_ " and  each, a " _Share_ "),  other  than any Cancelled Shares (to
the extent provided in Section 2.1(c)) and any  Dissenting Shares (to the
extent provided for in Section 2.1(f)) shall thereupon  be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to  receive
$40.00 in cash (the " _Merger  Consideration_ ").  All  Shares that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration as
provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled  and shall
cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately  prior to
the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any  rights
with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration.

 

 

(b) _Rollover  Shares_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each Share  (including a Restricted Share, as defined in Section
5.5(a)(iii) below) that  is  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is  owned, beneficially or of record, by any person
that is a party to an Employee  Rollover Agreement or a Founder Rollover
Agreement (each as hereinafter defined)  and that is expressly designated in
such Employee Rollover Agreement or Founder  Rollover Agreement as a
"Rollover Share" (each such share, a "Rollover Share" and each such person, a
" _Participating  Holder_ "),  shall  be cancelled immediately prior to the
Effective Time and converted into the  number of validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of common stock  of  Parent as described on
Schedule A to this Agreement (the " _Parent  Common Stock_ "),  and  shall
be subject to terms and conditions as set forth in (A) agreements to  be 
entered into between certain employees of the Company who will be
Participating  Holders and Parent (the " _Employee  Rollover Agreements_
")  and  (B) agreements to be entered into between certain stockholders of
the Company  who will be

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Participating  Holders and Parent (the " _Founder  Rollover Agreements_
").  As of  immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Rollover Shares
shall cease  to  exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any
such Rollover Shares  shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to  receive  the shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth
in this Section  2.1(b).

 

 

 

(c) _Company,  Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_.  Each  Share that is
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately  prior to
the Effective Time or held by the Company, or any Subsidiary of the  Company,
immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than  any  such
Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled  Shares_ ") 
shall,  by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder  thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration  shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(d) _Conversion  of Merger Sub Common Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,  of  Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall  be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable 
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation  with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and  shall  constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving  Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing  the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent  the  number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they  were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding  sentence.

 

 

(e) _Adjustments_.  If at  any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective  Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company  shall  occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split  (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment  of  shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during  such period
(excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), the  Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such  change.

 

 

(f) _Dissenting  Shares_.  (i)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Shares  issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the holder  of  which (A) has not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing,  (B) has demanded its
rights to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of  the  DGCL, and (C)
has not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal  (the "
_Dissenting  Shares_ "),  shall  be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 2.1(a). By virtue of
the Merger, all Dissenting Shares  shall  be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and shall represent the right to receive  only those rights provided
under the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time,  a  holder of Dissenting
Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting  rights or other
rights of a stockholder, member or equity owner of the Surviving 
Corporation. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the 
Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 to pay for shares of Company Common
Stock  for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Parent  upon  demand.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding  the provisions of this Section 2.1(f), if any holder of
Shares who demands  dissenters' rights shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to  perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its rights
of appraisal, then,  as  of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such  holder's Shares shall no longer be Dissenting
Shares and shall automatically be  converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration,  without any interest thereon and
less any required withholding  Taxes.

 

 

(iii) The  Company shall give Parent (A) notice of any written demands for
dissenters' rights of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments  served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company which
relate to any  such  demand for dissenters' rights and (B) the opportunity
reasonably to direct all  negotiations and proceedings (subject to the
Company's right to object to any  actions or positions taken by Parent that
it deems, in its sole discretion,  unreasonable) with respect to demands for
dissenters' rights under the DGCL. The  Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall  not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), make any payment with respect to  any  demands for dissenters'
rights or offer to settle or settle any such  demands.

 

 

Section  2.2. _Exchange  of Certificates_.

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited,  with a bank or trust company that is
organized and doing business under the  Laws  of the United States or any
state thereof, and has a combined capital and  surplus of at least $500
million, that shall be appointed to act as a paying  agent hereunder and
approved in advance by the Company in writing (and pursuant  to an agreement
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the  Company) (the
" _Paying  Agent_ "),  in  trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares,
the Company Stock Options and  the Director Award Accounts (collectively, the
" _Option  and Stock-Based Award Consideration_ "),  cash  in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in  exchange for all
of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time (other
than the Cancelled Shares, the Rollover Shares and the Dissenting  Shares),
payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior  to the
Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ")  (or  effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares  represented
by book-entry (" _Book-Entry  Shares_ ")  pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II and (ii) the Option and  Stock-Based Award Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 5.5 (such cash  referred to in subsections (a)(i) and
(a)(ii) being hereinafter referred to  as  the " _Exchange  Fund_ ").

 

 

(b) _Payment  Procedures_.

 

 

(i) As  soon  as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later  than the second business day following the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent  shall mail (x) to each holder of record of Shares whose
Shares were converted  into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(a), (A) a letter of  transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk  of  loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of Certificates  (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the  Paying Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent  and the Company may mutually
agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting  the surrender of
Certificates (or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for  the  Merger Consideration, (y) to each holder of a Company
Stock Option or a Director  Award Account, a check in an amount, if any, due
and payable to such holder  pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(i) or Section
5.5(a)(iii), respectively, in respect  of such Company Stock Option or
Director Award Account and (z) to each holder  of  a certificate
representing Rollover Shares who is party to a Founder Rollover  Agreement or
an Employee Rollover Agreement, upon surrender to the Surviving  Corporation
of such certificate and such other documents as may reasonably  be  required
by the Surviving Corporation and Parent, a certificate or certificates 
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder  is  entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b), subject to the terms and
conditions  of the  holder's Employee Rollover Agreement or Founder Rollover
Agreement, as the case  may be. No interest shall be paid or accrued on such
amounts. In the event  that  any Certificate represents both Rollover Shares
and Shares entitled to receive  the Merger Consideration, the Paying Agent
shall take such action as necessary  to split the Certificates accordingly.

 

 

 

(ii) Upon  surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof)  or  Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal,  duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto,  and such other documents as may customarily
be required thereby or by the Paying  Agent, the holder of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled  to  receive in exchange therefor a
check in an amount equal to the product of (x)  the number of Shares
represented by such holder's properly surrendered  Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry  Shares multiplied by (y)
the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid  or  accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry  Shares. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered  in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon  due 
surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate  formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied  by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence  to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that any applicable  stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered  as  contemplated by this Section 2.2(b),
each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share  shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the  right  to receive upon such
surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as  contemplated by this
Article II.

 

 

(iii) The  Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration  otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares
or holder of  Company Stock Options, such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted  under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_
")  or any  provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the
making of  such  payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted and paid over  to  the applicable Governmental Entity, such
withheld or deducted amounts shall  be  treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder  of  the Shares or holder of the
Company Stock Options, in respect of which such  deduction and withholding
were made.

 

 

(c) _Closing  of Transfer Books_.  At the  Effective Time, the stock

REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 

Except  as  disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (other than risk factor
and similarly  cautionary and forward looking disclosure contained in the
Company SEC Documents  under the headings "Risk Factors", "Forward Looking
Statements" or "Future  Operating Results"), or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to  Parent immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Company  Disclosure Schedule_ "),  the  Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as  follows:

 

 

Section  3.1. _Qualification,  Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._   Each
of  the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each Company Joint Venture, is a
legal  entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws  of  its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate  or  similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets  and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and is qualified to do  business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction  where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its assets or properties or conduct  of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be  so  organized, validly
existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such  power or authority,
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company  Material Adverse
Effect. As used in this Agreement, " _Company  Joint Venture_ " means  any
entity (other than Kentucky Speedway) (including partnerships, limited 
liability companies and other business associations and joint ventures) that 
is  not a Subsidiary in which the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company,
directly  or indirectly, owns an equity or ownership interest and (i) does
not have voting  power under ordinary circumstances to elect a majority of
the board of  directors, board of managers, executive committee or other
person or body  performing similar functions but in which the Company or a
Subsidiary of the  Company has rights with respect to the management of such
person and/or (ii)  which is a general partner or managing partner or
equivalent of an entity which  operates, or receives the financial benefits
of operating, one or more  restaurants. As used in this Agreement, any
reference to any facts,  circumstances, events or changes having a "
_Company  Material Adverse Effect_ " means  any facts, circumstances,
events or changes that are materially adverse to  the  business, financial
condition or long-term profitability of the Company and  its  Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, but shall not include facts, circumstances,  events or
changes (a) generally affecting the casual dining or restaurant  industries
in the United States or the economy or the financial or securities  markets
in the United States or elsewhere in the world, including regulatory  and 
political conditions or developments (including any outbreak or escalation 
of  hostilities or acts of war or terrorism) or changes in interest rates or
(b)  to  the extent resulting from (i) the announcement or the existence of,
or  compliance with, this Agreement or the announcement of the Merger or any
of  the  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_  
that  compliance by the Company with the requirement to operate in the
ordinary course  of business as required by Section 5.1(a) shall not be
excluded), (ii) any  litigation arising from allegations of a breach of
fiduciary duty or other  violation of applicable Law relating to this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) changes
in applicable Law, GAAP or  accounting standards, (iv) changes in the market
price or trading volume of  the  Company Common Stock, (v) changes in any
analyst's recommendations, any  financial strength rating or any other
recommendations or ratings as to the  Company or its Subsidiaries (including,
in and of itself, any failure to meet  analyst projections) or (vi) the
failure

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Company to meet any expected or projected financial or operating
performance  target publicly announced prior to the date of this Agreement,
as well as  any  change by the Company in any expected or projected
financial or operating  performance target as compared with any target
publicly announced prior to  the  date of this Agreement, _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  any change, effect, development, event or occurrence
described in the foregoing  clause (a) above shall not constitute or give
rise to a Company Material  Adverse  Effect only if and to the extent that
such change, effect, development, event  or  occurrence does not have a
disproportionate effect on the Company and its  Subsidiaries as compared to
other persons in the casual dining or restaurant  industries and _provided_
_further_   that the  facts, circumstances or events underlying the change
or failure in each of  clauses (b)(iv), (b)(v) or (b)(vi) shall not be
excluded to the extent such  facts, circumstances or events would otherwise
constitute a Company Material  Adverse Effect. The Company has made available
to Parent prior to the date  of  this Agreement a true and complete copy of
the Company's amended and restated  certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
each as amended through the date  of  this Agreement. Such amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and  bylaws are in full force and
effect. The certificate of incorporation and  bylaws  or similar
organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Company and  each 
Company Joint Venture are in full force and effect, except as would not
have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither  the  Company, any Subsidiary, nor any Company Joint Venture is in
violation of  any  provisions of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or similar  organizational documents, other than such violations as would not
have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse  Effect.

restricted stock units, phantom  units, deferred stock units and dividend
equivalents) (" _Other  Incentive Awards_ "),  the  number of Shares
issuable thereunder or with respect thereto, the vesting  schedule, the

been  duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming

(d) Section  3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
any consent,  approval, authorization or permit of, action by, registration,

Company Joint Venture is  a  party which is required in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and  the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than those the  failure of which to obtain would not have,
individually or in the aggregate,  a  Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  3.4. _Reports  and Financial Statements_.

 

 

(a) The  Company has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports
(including  exhibits) required to be filed or furnished prior to the date of
this Agreement  by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ")  since  December 31, 2003 (the " _Company  SEC Documents_ ").  As
of  their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such 
amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with 
the  requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act, as the
case  may  be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and none  of  the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact  or  omitted to state or incorporate by
reference any material fact required to  be  stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary to make the statements  therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not  misleading. No 
Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form or report with the 
SEC.

 

 

(b) The  consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules)  of  the Company included in the Company SEC Documents have been
prepared in  accordance with GAAP and fairly present in all material respects
the  consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated 
Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated
results  of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods  then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end  audit adjustments and to any other
adjustments described therein, including  the  notes thereto) in conformity
with United States GAAP (except, in the case of  the  unaudited statements,
as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis  during the periods
involved (except as may

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  indicated therein or in the notes thereto). Since January 1, 2006,
there  has  been no material change in the Company's accounting methods or
principles that  would be required to be disclosed in the Company's financial
statements in  accordance with GAAP, except as described in the notes to such
Company financial  statements.

 

 

 

Section  3.5. _Internal  Controls and Procedures_.  The  Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and  internal
control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in  paragraphs
(e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)  as 
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure 
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material 
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it 
files  or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and  reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC,  and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated
to the  Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required  disclosure and to make the certifications required
pursuant to Sections 302  and  906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley  Act_ ").  The  Company's management has completed
assessment of the effectiveness of the  Company's internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the  requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended  December 31, 2005, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were  effective. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior  to the date of this
Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee  of the Board of
Directors and Parent (A) any significant deficiencies and  material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over  financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any  material
respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report 
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves  executive officers or employees who have a significant role in the
Company's  internal controls over financial reporting. As of the date of this
Agreement,  to  the knowledge of the Company, the Company has not identified
any material  weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial  reporting. There are no outstanding loans made by the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7
under the  Exchange Act) or director of the Company.

 

 

Section  3.6. _No  Undisclosed Liabilities_.  Except  (a) as reflected or
reserved against in the Company's consolidated balance  sheets (or the notes
thereto) included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form  10-Q for the
quarter ended June 30, 2006 (other than risk factor and similarly  cautionary
and forward looking disclosure under the headings "Risk Factors", "Forward
Looking Statements" or "Future Operating Results") (b) for liabilities 
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, (c) for liabilities and
obligations  incurred in the ordinary course of business since June 30, 2006
and (d) for  liabilities or obligations which have been discharged or paid in
full in the  ordinary course of business, as of the date of this Agreement,
neither the  Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company or, to the knowledge
of the Company,  any Company Joint Venture, has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature,  whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by  GAAP  to be reflected on a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its  Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other
than those which would not have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  3.7. _Compliance  with Law; Permits_.

 

 

(a) The  Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each of the Company Joint
Ventures  are,  and since January 1, 2005, have been, in compliance with and
are not in default  under or in violation of any applicable federal, state,
local or foreign law,  statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, decree or  agency requirement of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Laws_ " and  each, a " _Law_ "),  except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not have,  individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Section 3.7(a), no representation  or  warranty shall be
deemed to be made in this Section 3.7(a) in respect of the  matters
referenced in Section 3.4 or Section 3.5, or in respect of  environmental,
Tax, employee benefits or labor Law matters.

 

 

(b) The  Company and its Subsidiaries and each of the Company Joint Ventures
are in  possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits,  easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders  of any Governmental Entity necessary for the Company and each of
its  Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their respective properties and
assets  or  to carry on their respective businesses as they are now being
conducted (the  " _Company  Permits_ "),  except where the failure to have
any of the Company Permits would not have,  individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company  Permits are in full force and
effect, except where the failure to be in full  force and effect would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company  Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of  the  Company Joint
Ventures have made all filings with all state, provincial and  foreign
authorities and obtained all registrations and authorizations required  for
the offer and sale of franchises in all states and provinces in the United 
States and Canada, and all foreign jurisdictions, where it offers or has
offered  or sold franchises, including all amendment and renewal filings, and
the Uniform  Franchise Offering Circulars and any other franchise disclosure
document  (" _UFOCs_ ")  used  in connection with the offer and sale of
franchises for the brands comply in  all  material respects with the
requirements of applicable Laws, rules and  regulations, except where the
failure to make such filings, obtain such  registrations and authorizations
or to so comply would not have, individually  or  in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  3.8. _Environmental  Laws and Regulations_.

 

 

(a) Except  as  would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse  Effect, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective  businesses in compliance with all applicable Environmental
Laws, (ii) to the  knowledge of the Company, none of the properties owned,
leased or operated  by  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contains any

its Subsidiaries in amounts  exceeding the levels permitted by applicable
Environmental Laws, (iii) since  December 31, 2005, as of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor  any  of its Subsidiaries has received
any notices, demand letters or requests for  information from any federal,
state, local or foreign Governmental Entity  indicating that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries may be in violation  of,  or liable under, any
Environmental Law in connection with the ownership or  operation of their
respective businesses or any of their respective properties  or assets, (iv)
to the knowledge of the Company, no Hazardous Substance has  been  disposed
of, released or transported in violation of any applicable  Environmental
Law, or in a manner giving

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rise  to  any liability under Environmental Law, from any properties
presently or formerly  owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its

and  complete copy of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other
equivalent  organizational documents of Parent and Merger Sub, each as
amended through  the  date of this Agreement. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar  organizational documents of Parent and
Merger Sub are in full force and effect,  except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material  Adverse Effect. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any provisions  of its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational  documents, other than
such violations as would not have, individually or in  the  aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  4.2. _Corporate  Authority Relative to This Agreement; No
Violation_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter  into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation  of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
have been duly and validly  authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent
and Merger Sub and by Parent,  as  the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and,
except for the filing of the  Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware,  no  other corporate proceedings on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary  to  authorize this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered  by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid  and  binding
agreements of the Company, this Agreement constitutes the valid and  binding
agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent  and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms.

 

 

(b) Other  than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the provisions
of the DGCL,  (ii) the Exchange Act, state securities, takeover and "blue
sky" laws and (iii)  the HSR Act (collectively, the " _Parent  Approvals_
"),  no  authorization, consent, permit, action or approval of, or filing
with, or  notification to, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the
consummation  by  Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except  for such authorizations, consents, permits, actions,
approvals, notifications  or  filings, that, if not obtained or made, would
not have, individually or in  the  aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 

(c) The  execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement
does not,  and,  except as described in Section 4.2(b), the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the
provisions of this  Agreement will not (i) result in any violation of, or
default (with or without  notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  rise  to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation or
acceleration of any  material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit
under any loan,  guarantee of Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture,  lease, agreement, contract, instrument, permit,
franchise or license agreement  binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to which any of them is  a  party or any of their
respective properties are bound, or result in the creation  of any Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets  of 
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any
violation  of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
other  equivalent organizational document, in each case as amended, of Parent
or  any of  its Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with or violate any
applicable Laws, other  than, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such
violation, conflict,  default, termination, cancellation, acceleration,
right, loss or Lien that  would  not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

 

Section  4.3. _Investigations;  Litigation_.  There  is no investigation
or review pending (or, to the knowledge of Parent,  threatened) by any
Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries which
would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent  Material Adverse
Effect, and there are no actions, suits, inquiries,  investigations or
proceedings pending (or, to Parent's knowledge, threatened)  against or
affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective  properties
at law or in equity before, and there are no orders, judgments or  decrees
of, or before, any Governmental Entity, in each case, which would have, 
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  4.4. _Schedule  13E-3/Proxy Statement; Other Information_.  None
of  the information provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included in
the  Schedule 13E-3 or the Proxy Statement will, in the case of the Schedule
13E-3,  as of the date of its filing and of each amendment or supplement
thereto and,  in  the case of the Proxy Statement, (i) at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy  Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto and
(ii) at the time of  the  Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to  state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order  to  make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they  were  made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger  Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information  supplied by the
Company or any of its Representatives that is contained or  incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule  13E-3.

 

 

Section  4.5. _Financing_.  Section  4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
sets forth true, accurate and complete  copies of (a) executed equity
commitment letters to provide equity financing  to  Parent and/or Merger Sub
and (b) an executed debt commitment letter and related  term sheets (the "
_Debt  Commitment Letter_ " and  together with the equity commitment
letters described in clause (a), the " _Financing  Commitments_ ") 
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, certain 
lenders and their affiliates have committed to provide and arrange the 
financings described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to
consummate  the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Debt  Financing_ " and  together with the equity
financing referred to in clause (a), the " _Financing_ ").  As of  the date
of this Agreement, (i) the Financing Commitments are in full force  and 
effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or 
modified in any respect (except as permitted by this Agreement) and (ii)
neither  Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions
set forth  therein and no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  or  both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or
failure to satisfy  a condition precedent set forth in the Financing
Commitments. As of the date  of  this Agreement, subject to the accuracy of
the representations and warranties  of  the Company set forth in Article III
hereof, and the satisfaction of the  conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and
6.3 hereof, neither Parent nor Merger  Sub has any reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy the conditions  of closing to be satisfied by it
set forth in the Financing Commitments on  the  Closing Date. Assuming the
funding of the Financing in accordance with the  Financing Commitments, the
proceeds from such Financing constitute all of  the  financing required for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this  Agreement, and,
together with cash on hand from operations of the Company  (assuming for such
purposes that, as of the Closing Date, such cash on hand  will  equal $50
million and outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money (excluding 
guarantees) will equal $308 million), **** are  sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations  under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and  the 
Option and Stock-Based Award Consideration (and any fees and expenses of 
or  payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation). All of the 
conditions precedent to the obligations of the lenders under the Debt
Commitment  Letter to make the Debt Financing available to Parent and/or
Merger Sub are  set  forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, and the equity
commitment letter contains  all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the funding party to  make  the equity financing thereunder
available to Parent and/or Merger Sub on  the  terms therein.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  one  or more
Debt Commitment Letters may be amended, modified, supplemented, restated  or
superseded at the option of Parent and Merger Sub after the date hereof 
but  prior to the Effective Time (the " _New  Financing Commitments_ "); 
_provided_   that the  terms of any New Financing Commitment shall not (i)
reduce the aggregate  amount  of the Financing, (ii) expand upon the
conditions precedent to the Financing  as  set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter in any respect that would reasonably  be  expected to make such
conditions less likely to be satisfied, or (iii)  reasonably be expected to
delay the Closing. In such event, the terms "Debt  Commitment Letter" and
"Financing Commitments" as used herein shall be deemed to  include the Debt
Commitment Letters that are not so amended, modified,  supplemented, restated
or superseded at the time in question and the New  Financing Commitments to
the extent then in effect. Parent has also delivered  to  the Company a
guarantee (each, a " _Guarantee_ ")  addressed to the Company from each of
(x) Catterton Partners VI, L.P. and  Catterton Partners VI, Offshore, L.P.
and (y) Bain  Capital Fund IX, L.P. (collectively, the " _Guarantors_ ") 
with  respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein. Each
Guarantee  is in  full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the  Guarantor subject thereto.

 

 

 

Section  4.6. _Capitalization  of Merger Sub_.  As of  the date of this
Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists  of 1,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are  validly
issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock  of
Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a
direct  or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has
outstanding no  option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to
which any person  other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger
Sub. Merger Sub  has  not conducted any business prior to the date of this
Agreement and has, and  prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets,
liabilities or obligations  of  any nature other than those incident to its
formation and pursuant to this  Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  4.7. _No  Vote of Parent Stockholders_.  No vote  of the
stockholders of Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent 
(equity or otherwise) is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of 
incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of
Parent  or the applicable rules of any exchange on which securities of Parent
are  traded, in order for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated
by  this  Agreement.

 

 

Section  4.8. _Finders  or Brokers_.  Neither  Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker  or  finder in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who  is 
entitled to any fee or any commission in connection with or upon
consummation  of  the Merger.

 

 

Section  4.9. _Lack  of Ownership of Company Common Stock_.  Neither 
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly,  any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities
convertible into,  exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company
Common Stock. There  are  no voting trusts or other agreements, arrangements
or understandings to which  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the voting of  the  capital stock or other equity interest of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  nor are there any agreements,
arrangements or understandings to which Parent  or  any of its Subsidiaries
is a party with respect to the acquisition, divestiture,  retention,
purchase, sale or tendering of the capital stock or other equity  interest of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

Section  4.10. _Interest  in Competitors_.  Neither  Parent nor Merger Sub
owns any interest(s), nor do any of their respective  affiliates insofar as
such affiliate-owned interests would be attributed to  Parent or Merger Sub
under the HSR Act, in any entity or person that derives  a  substantial
portion of its revenues from a line of business within the Company's 
principal lines of business.

 

 

Section  4.11. _WARN  Act_.  Parent  and Merger Sub are neither planning
nor contemplating, and Parent and Merger  Sub  have neither made nor taken,
any decisions or actions concerning the Company  Employees after the Closing
that would require the service of notice under  the  WARN Act or similar
local laws.

 

 

Section  4.12. _No  Additional Representations_.

 

 

(a) Parent  acknowledges that, to its knowledge, as of the date hereof, it
and its  Representatives have received access to such books and records,
facilities,  equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company which it
and its  Representatives, as of the date hereof, have requested to review,
and that  it  and its Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with
the management  of  the Company and to discuss the business and assets of
the Company.

 

 

(b) Parent  acknowledges that neither the Company nor any person has made any
representation  or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any  information regarding the Company furnished or made
available to Parent and  its  Representatives except as expressly set forth
in Article III (which includes  the  Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Company SEC Documents), and neither the  Company nor any other person shall
be subject to any liability to Parent or  any  of its affiliates resulting
from the Company's making available to Parent or  Parent's use of such
information provided or made

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  to Parent or its Representatives, or any information, documents or
material  made  available to Parent in the due diligence materials provided
to Parent, other  management presentations (formal or informal) or in any
other form in connection  with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the  foregoing, the Company makes no
representation or warranty to Parent with  respect to any financial
projection or forecast relating to the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not included in any management  presentation.

 

 

 

Section  4.13. _Solvency_.  Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to
the obligation of Parent and  Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, (b) the
accuracy of the representation  as  warranties of the Company set forth in
Article III hereof and (c) the Required  Financial Information fairly present
the consolidated financial condition of  the  Company and its Subsidiaries
as at the end of the periods covered thereby and  the consolidated results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries  for  the periods covered
thereby, then immediately after giving effect to the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any financing in  connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), as of the  Closing Date,
(i) the aggregate "fair saleable value" of the assets of the  Surviving
Corporation and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,  as of 
such date, exceeds (A) the value of all "liabilities of the Surviving 
Corporation and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including 
contingent and other liabilities", as of such date, as such quoted terms are 
generally determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing 
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be 
required to pay the probable liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and
its  consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on their existing debts
(including  contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and
matured, (ii) the  Surviving Corporation and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole,  do  not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the  operation of their businesses in which they are
engaged or proposed to be  engaged following such date, and (iii) the
Surviving Corporation and its  consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will be able to pay its  liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they  mature.

 

 

Section  4.14. _Management  Agreements_.  Other  than this Agreement,
there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments,  agreements or obligations
or understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or  any  of their affiliates,
on the one hand, and any member of the Company's management  or the Board of
Directors or any Participating Holders, on the other hand  relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations  of  the
Company after the Effective Time.

writing or  otherwise, or announce an intention, to take any of the
foregoing  actions;

 

 

(xxi) shall  not  consent to or otherwise voluntarily agree to guarantee or
become liable for  any  indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of amounts
outstanding as of the  date  of this Agreement of, or increase its
obligations to make capital contributions  to, Kentucky Speedway; and

 

 

(xxii) shall  use  commercially reasonable efforts to direct the business of
the Company Joint  Ventures to be conducted in compliance with the provisions
of this Section  5.1  as if the Company Joint Ventures were Subsidiaries of
the Company.

 

 

(c) Parent  agrees with the Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries
and  affiliates, that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time,  Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates  to,  take or agree to take any action (including entering into
agreements with  respect to any acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  combinations) which would reasonably be expected to result in,
individually  or  in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

Section  5.2. _Investigation_.

 

 

(a) The  Company shall afford to Parent and to its officers, employees,
accountants,  consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, prospective
financing sources  and agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ")  reasonable access during normal business hours,
throughout the period prior  to  the earlier of the Effective Time and the
Termination Date, to its and its  Subsidiaries' officers, employees,
properties, contracts, commitments, books and  records and any report,
schedule or other document filed or received by it  pursuant to the
requirements of applicable Laws and shall furnish Parent with  financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent, through its  officers,
employees or other authorized representatives, may from time to time 
reasonably request in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall  not be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt
the  operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a
violation  of  any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, would  cause a reasonable risk of a loss of privilege to the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any
applicable Law, nor shall  Parent or any of its Representatives be permitted
to perform any onsite  procedure (including any onsite environmental study)
with respect to any  property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except, with respect to  any  on site procedure, with the Company's prior
written consent (which consent shall  not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned if such procedure is  necessary for the Debt Financing).

 

 

(b) Parent  hereby agrees that all information provided to it or its
Representatives in  connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be
Evaluation Material, as  such term is used in, and shall be treated in
accordance with, the  Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 9, 2006,
between the Company, Bain  Capital Partners, LLC and Catterton Partners (the
" _Confidentiality  Agreement_ ").

 

 

Section  5.3. _No  Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) During  the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59  p.m. (New York time) on the date that is fifty (50) days after
the date of  the  public announcement of this Agreement (the "
_Solicitation  Period End Date_ "),  the  Company, its Subsidiaries, and
their respective Representatives shall be  permitted to, and shall have the
right to, directly or indirectly (acting under  the direction of the Special
Committee) (i) solicit, initiate or encourage  any inquiry with respect to,
or the making, submission or announcement of,  any  Alternative Proposal and
(ii) participate in discussions or negotiations  regarding, and furnish to
any person information with respect to, and take  any  other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that  constitutes, or
may lead to, an Alternative Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the
Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries 
or any Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, provide to any 
third party any material non-public information unless the Company receives 
from  such third party an executed confidentiality agreement with
confidentiality  provisions in form no more favorable to such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  than those confidentiality provisions contained in the
Confidentiality  Agreement. Parent agrees that neither it nor any affiliate
or Subsidiary  of  Parent shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause  its and  their respective Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, contact,  discourage, interfere with or participate in
discussions with, any person  that,  to Parent's knowledge, has made, or is
considering or participating in  discussions or negotiations with the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their  respective Representatives regarding, an
Alternative  Proposal.

 

 

 

(b) Subject  to Sections 5.3(c)-(e), and except as it may relate to any
person or group  of  related persons from whom the Company has received,
prior to the Solicitation  Period End Date, a written indication of interest
that the Special Committee  or  the Board of Directors reasonably believes
is bona fide and could reasonably  be  expected to result in a Superior
Proposal (each such person or group, an " _Excluded  Party_ "),  (A)  on
the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its 
Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its and their respective Representatives 
to,  immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any parties that
may  be  ongoing with respect to any Alternative Proposal and (B) during the
period  beginning on the Solicitation Period End Date and continuing until
the Effective  Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with  Article VII, the Company agrees that neither it nor any
Subsidiary of the  Company shall, and that it shall direct its and their
respective Representatives  not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate  or  encourage any inquiry with respect to,
or the making, submission or announcement  of, any Alternative Proposal, (ii)
participate in any negotiations regarding  an  Alternative Proposal with, or
furnish any non-public information or access  to  its properties, books,
records or personnel to, any person that has made or,  to  the Company's
knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Proposal, (iii)  engage in
discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal with any person that  has 
made or, to the Company's knowledge, is considering making an Alternative 
Proposal, except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions 
of  this Section 5.3, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative
Proposal,  (v) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or
any agreement  providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements  permitted under Section 5.3(c)), (vi) otherwise
cooperate with, or assist or  participate in, or knowingly facilitate or
encourage any effort or attempt  by  any person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or their Representatives) with respect  to, or which would reasonably be
expected to result in, an Alternative Proposal,  or (vii) exempt any person
from the restrictions contained in any state takeover  or similar laws,
including Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise cause such  restrictions not
to apply. The Company shall promptly inform its  Representatives, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries promptly to inform their  respective Representatives,
of the obligations under this Section  5.3(b).

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  the limitations set forth in Section 5.3(b), at any time
from the Solicitation  Period End Date and continuing until the earlier of
the receipt of the Company  Stockholder Approval and the Termination Date, if
the Company receives an  unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Proposal
(A) which (i) constitutes  a  Superior Proposal or (ii) which the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors  determines in good faith could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior  Proposal and (B) the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors determines  in  good faith, after
consultation with the Special Committee's or the Company's  legal counsel
that the failure of the Special Committee or the Board of  Directors to take
the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with  respect to such
Alternative Proposal

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary
obligations to the  Company's stockholders under applicable Law, then the
Company may take the  following actions: (x) furnish non-public information
to the third party  making  such Alternative Proposal (if, and only if,
prior to so furnishing such  information, the Company receives from the third
party an executed  confidentiality agreement with confidentiality provisions
in form no more  favorable to such person than those confidentiality
provisions contained  in the  Confidentiality Agreement) and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations  with  such third party with respect to such
Alternative Proposal.

 

 

 

(d) Other  than in accordance with Section 5.3, neither the Special Committee
nor Board  of  Directors shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly
to withdraw or  modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by the  Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the
Merger or this Agreement  or  the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) approve, adopt  or  recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt or recommend, any Alternative  Proposal; (iii) make any
recommendation in connection with a tender offer or  exchange offer other
than a recommendation against such offer or (iv) exempt  any  person from
the restrictions contained in any state takeover or similar laws,  including
Section 203 of the DGCL (each of the foregoing, a " _Change  of
Recommendation_ ");  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  in response to the
receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn  or  abandoned,
the Special Committee or the Board of Directors may, at any time,  make a
Change of Recommendation if the Special Committee or the Board of  Directors
has concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Company's or  the
Special Committee's legal and financial advisors, that the failure of the 
Special Committee or the Board of Directors to effect a Change of
Recommendation  would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their
fiduciary  obligations to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law. No
Change of  Recommendation shall change the approval of the Special Committee
or the Board  of Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover statute
or other state  law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.

 

 

(e) Nothing  in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Special
Committee or the Board  of Directors from making a Change of Recommendation
to the extent that the  Special Committee or the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after  consultation with the Company's or the
Special Committee's legal counsel, that  the failure of the Special Committee
or the Board of Directors to effect a  Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors' exercise of  their fiduciary obligations to
the Company's stockholders under applicable  Law.

 

 

(f) Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors  from disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9  and  14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

 

(g) As  used  in this Agreement, " _Alternative  Proposal_ " shall  mean
any bona fide proposal or offer made by any person or group of persons 
(other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) for
(i)  a  merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination,  recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar
transaction involving  the  Company, (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition
in a single transaction or  series of related transactions by any person of
twenty-five percent (25%) or  more of the assets of the Company

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) the direct or indirect
acquisition  in a  single transaction or series of related transactions by
any person of  twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common  Stock, (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would  result  in any person beneficially owning twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of the  Shares then outstanding, or (v) all or a
substantial portion of any Specified  Concept (as defined below). "
_Specified  Concept_ " means  each of the restaurant chains known by the
following names: Outback Steakhouse,  Bonefish Grill, Carrabba's Italian
Grill, Fleming\'s Prime Steakhouse and Wine  Bar and Roy's.

 

 

 

(h) As  used  in this Agreement " _Superior  Proposal_ " shall  mean an
Alternative Proposal (with all percentages, in the definition of  Alternative
Proposal increased to 50%) on terms that the Special Committee  or  the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the 
Company's or the Special Committee's financial advisors and legal counsel,
and  considering such factors as the Special Committee or the Board of
Directors,  as  applicable, consider to be appropriate (including the
timing, ability to  finance, financial and regulatory aspects and likelihood
of consummation of  such  proposal, and any alterations to this Agreement
agreed to in writing by Parent  in response thereto), is more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders  than  the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

Section  5.4. _Filings;  Other Actions_.

 

 

(a) The  Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each use all reasonable efforts
to take  or  cause to be taken such actions as may be required to be taken
under the Exchange  Act any other federal securities Laws, and under any
applicable state securities  or "blue sky" Laws in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Proxy Statement and the Schedule  13E-3. In connection with the Merger and
the Company Meeting, the Company shall  prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3  relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, and the Company and Parent
shall use all reasonable efforts to  respond to the comments of the SEC and
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed  to the Company's stockholders, all
as promptly as reasonably practicable;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, the
Company  shall consult with Parent with respect to such filings and shall
afford Parent  or its Representatives reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon. Parent and  Merger Sub shall provide the Company with any
information for inclusion in  the  Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3
which may be required under applicable  Law and/or which is reasonably
requested by the Company. The Company shall  notify Parent of the receipt of
comments of the SEC and of any request from  the  SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3  or for additional
information, and will promptly supply Parent with copies  of  all
correspondence between the Company or its Representatives, on the one hand, 
and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the 
Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the Merger. Each of the Company,
Parent  and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
resolve  all  SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement and the
Schedule 13E-3 and  any  other required filings as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof. Each  of  the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to
correct any information provided  by  it for use in the Proxy Statement
which shall have become false or misleading.  If at any time prior to the
Company Meeting any event should occur which is  required by applicable Law
to be set forth in an amendment of, or a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplement  to, the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, the Company will
promptly  inform  Parent. In such case, the Company, with the cooperation of
Parent, will,  upon  learning of such event, promptly prepare and file such
amendment or supplement  with the SEC to the extent required by applicable
Law and shall mail such  amendment or supplement to the Company's
stockholders to the extent required by  applicable Law; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  prior to such filing, the Company shall consult with
Parent with respect  to such  amendment or supplement and shall afford
Parent or its Representatives  reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.
Notwithstanding the forgoing,  the  Company shall have no obligation to
notify Parent of any matters to the extent  that the Special Committee or the
Board of Directors determines in good faith,  after consultation with the
Company's or the Special Committee's legal counsel,  that to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their  fiduciary obligations to
the Company's stockholders under applicable  Law.

 

 

 

(b) Prior  to  the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date,
the Company and  Parent shall cooperate with each other in order to lift any
injunctions or  remove any other legal impediment to the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Subject  to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action  necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its amended and
restated certificate  of incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold  a  meeting of its stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following  the  mailing of the Proxy Statement for
the purpose of obtaining the Company  Stockholder Approval (the " _Company 
Meeting_ ")  (including mailing the Proxy Statement as soon as reasonably
practicable after  the SEC has cleared the Proxy Statement and holding the
Company Meeting no  later  than 30 days after mailing the Proxy Statement,
unless a later date is mutually  agreed by the Company and by Parent), (ii)
include in the Proxy Statement the  recommendation of the Board of Directors,
based on the unanimous recommendation  of the Special Committee, that the
stockholders of the Company vote in favor  of  the adoption of this
Agreement and, subject to the approval of the Advisors,  as  applicable, the
written opinions of the Advisors, dated as of the date of this  Agreement,
that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a  financial
point of view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock and (iii)  use all
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor  of 
the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, unless this Agreement
is terminated in  accordance with Article VII, the Company will take all of
the actions  contemplated by Section 5.4(a) and Section 5.4(c) regardless of
whether the  Board of Directors (acting through the Special Committee, if
then in existence)  has approved, endorsed or recommended an Alternative
Proposal or has withdrawn,  modified or amended the Recommendation, and will
submit this Agreement for  adoption by the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Meeting.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the  Company shall not be required to hold the Company Meeting if
this Agreement  is  terminated in accordance with Article VII.

Section  5.5. _Stock  Options and Other Stock-Based Awards; Employee
Matters_.

 

 

(a) _Stock  Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.  Except  as otherwise
agreed to in writing between the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and  certain
members of management of the Company listed in Schedule A to this  Agreement,
and solely with respect to such members of management of the Company  and to
the extent specified in such Section of the Parent Disclosure  Schedules:

 

 

(i) Each  option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company  Stock Option_ ")  granted under the Company Stock Plans or
otherwise, whether vested or unvested,  that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, as of the  Effective Time, become fully vested
and be converted into the right to receive  at the Effective Time an amount
in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product  of  (x) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company  Stock Option and (y)
the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger  Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject  to such Company
Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded  down to the
nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash hereinafter referred  to as
the " _Option  Consideration_ ")  less  such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any  provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of  such  payment.

 

 

(ii) At  the  Effective Time, each account under the Company's Directors' 
Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended, (each, a " _Directors '  Award
Account_"),  shall  become fully vested and payable and shall entitle the
holder thereof to receive,  at the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration  in  respect of each notional Share credited to the
holder under his or her Director  Award Account.

 

 

(iii) Immediately  prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted
Company Common Stock  (the " _Restricted  Shares_ ")  shall  be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in an amount  as 
determined under Section 2.1(a), payable on a deferred basis at the time
that  the underlying Restricted Shares would have vested under their terms as
in  effect immediately prior to the Effective Time plus earnings thereon
(as  described below), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted  under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect  to the making of such payment and subject to the satisfaction
by the holder  of  such Restricted Shares of all terms and conditions to
which such vesting was  subject under the terms of the Restricted Shares as
in effect immediately prior  to the Effective Time, including without
limitation all forfeiture provisions,  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
the holder's deferred cash account will become immediately vested and
payable  upon termination of such holder's employment by the Company without
cause or  upon the individual's death or disability. If the holder of such
Restricted  Shares fails to satisfy such terms and conditions (as modified
hereby), such  holder shall forfeit his or her right to such Merger
Consideration and any  earnings thereon, and such amounts shall revert and be
forfeited to Parent.  Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall
establish a grantor trust  and  shall deposit therein the Merger
Consideration attributable to the Restricted  Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause such amounts  to be  invested at the
option of the account holder in a money market fund or an  SandP 500 Index Fund
and shall cause the earnings on such amounts to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  credited to the accounts under such grantor trust of the former holders
of  the  Restricted Shares.

 

 

 

(iv) At  the  Effective Time, all amounts held in the accounts denominated
in shares of  Company Common Stock under the Partner Equity Deferred
Compensation Stock Plan  component of the OSI Restaurant Partners, Inc.
Partner Equity Plan (the " _PEP_ ")  (each,  a " _Deferred  Unit Account_
")  shall  be converted into an obligation to pay cash with a value equal to
the product  of  (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares
of Company Common  Stock deemed held in such Deferred Unit Account, in
accordance with the payment  schedule and consistent with the terms of the
PEP as in effect from time to  time.  For  purposes of this Agreement, "
_Company  Stock-Based Awards_ " means  the obligations denominated in and
measured by reference to shares of Company  Common Stock that are credited to
the accounts under the Directors' Deferred  Compensation Plan, as amended,
and the Partner Equity Deferred Compensation  Stock Plan component of the
PEP.

 

 

(v) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Board of Directors or the
Compensation Committee of  the  Board of Directors, as applicable, shall
adopt amendments to the Company Stock  Plans and the applicable Company
Benefit Plans with respect to Company Stock  Options, Company Stock-Based
Awards and Restricted Shares to implement the  foregoing provisions of
Sections 5.5(a)(i), 5.5(a)(ii), 5.5(a)(iii) and  5.5(a)(iv).

 

 

(b) _Employee  Matters_.

 

 

(i) From  and  after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company
Benefit Plans and  compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance
with their terms as  in  effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a
period of two  years  following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided,  to  each current employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries  (" _Company  Employees_ ")  total  compensation and benefits
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate  to  the total
compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately  before
the Effective Time  (giving  consideration to equity-based compensation,
equity-based benefits and  nonqualified deferred compensation programs;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Parent shall not be required to provide
equity-based compensation, equity-based  benefits and nonqualified deferred
compensation programs); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  nothing herein
shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit  Plan or
interfere with Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' right or obligation  to
make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law or shall 
cause or require the extension, renewal or amendment of, or prevent the 
expiration of, any employment agreement which shall expire, terminate or
fail  to  renew pursuant to its terms during such period.

 

 

(ii) For  all  purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level  of  benefits) under the employee benefit plans
providing benefits to any Company  Employees after the Effective Time (the "
_New  Plans_ "),  each  Company Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the  Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the  Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before  the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company  employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was  eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time, _provided_   that the  foregoing shall not

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan
or  to the  extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits with  respect to the same period of service. In  addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each  Company 
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting 
time,  in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
is  comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated  immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans,
collectively,  the " _Old  Plans_ "),  and (B) for  purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or  vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing  condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to  be  waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such  conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the  Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately  prior to the
Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses  incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion  of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's  participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account  under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance  and  maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or  her  covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been  paid 
in accordance with such New Plan.

 

 

 

(iii) The  parties hereto agree to the additional matters set forth on
Section 5.5(b)(iii)  to the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

Section  5.6. _Reasonable  Best Efforts_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties  hereto shall use (and cause its affiliates to use) its

promptly, or cause to be done  promptly, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all  things necessary, proper or advisable under

approvals and waivers from third parties reasonably requested  by  Parent to
be obtained in respect of the Company Material Contracts in connection  with
the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether 
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation 
of  the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iv)  executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to
consummate  the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  prior to the Effective Time in
no event shall the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries be required to pay or,
absent the prior written consent of Parent  (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), pay  or  commit to pay any
material fee, material penalties or other material  consideration to any
landlord or other third party to obtain any consent,  approval or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

waiver  required for the consummation of the Merger under any real estate
leases  or  Company Material Contracts.

 

 

 

(b) Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing,  the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event
later than fifteen  (15) business days after the date of this Agreement, make
their respective  filings and thereafter make any other required submissions
under the HSR Act;  (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each
other in (x) determining  whether any filings are required to be made with,
or consents, permits,  authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to
be obtained from, any  third  parties or other Governmental Entities in
connection with the execution and  delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement and (y)
timely making all such filings and timely seeking  all  such consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals; (iii) use reasonable best  efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to  be  done,
all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make 
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including taking 
all  such further action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such
objections,  if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the

enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably  possible (and in any event
no later than the End Date), including (x) proposing,  negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate  order  or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses 
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or its

of action with  respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or
its Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving Corporation's) businesses, product
lines or assets, in  each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry

States Department of Justice  or  any other Governmental Entity regarding

contained  in  this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding,  including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to  be  instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as  violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate  in all respects with each other and shall use their
respective reasonable best  efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated,  lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order,  whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that  prohibits, prevents or restricts

preserve  or  promote diversity of media ownership or (iii) protect the
national security  or  the national economy of any nation.

indemnification and  advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the
current or former  directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of
the Company or its  Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate
of incorporation or  bylaws or other organization documents or in any
agreement shall survive the  Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. For a period of six (6)  years from the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall  maintain in effect exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses  provisions no less favorable in
the aggregate than those of the Company's and  any Company Subsidiary's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar  organization documents in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or  in  any indemnification
agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any  of  their respective
directors, officers or employees in effect immediately prior  to  the
Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such 
provisions, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, in any
manner  that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals
who at  the  Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action
pending or asserted  or  any claim made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such  Action or resolution of such claim. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent  shall assume, be jointly and severally
liable for, and honor, guaranty and  stand  surety for, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries  to  honor, in accordance with
their respective terms, each of the agreements  contained in this Section 5.9
without limit as to time.

 

 

(b) Each  of  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent permitted  under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and
advance funds in respect  of each of the foregoing) each current and former
director or officer of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each
person who served as a director,  officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership,  joint  venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise at the  request of the Company, in and to
the extent of their capacities as such and  not  as stockholders and/or
equity holders of the Company or its Subsidiaries or  otherwise (each,
together with such person's heirs, executors or administrators,  an "
_Indemnified  Party_ ")  against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys' fees and expenses  in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or  investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by  law),  judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in  settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or  investigative (an " _Action_
"),  arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission  occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the
Effective  Time  (including acts or omissions in connection with such
persons serving as an  officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if
such service was at the  request or for the benefit of the Company);
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Surviving Corporation will not be
liable for any settlement effected without  the Surviving Corporation's prior
written consent (such consent not to be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). In the event of any such Action,  Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party  in the defense of any
such Action.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) For  a  period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be  maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability  insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company and its  Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  after the
Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums  in 
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the 
date  of this Agreement in respect of the coverages required to be obtained
pursuant  hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably  practicable for such amount.

 

 

(d) Parent  shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that  may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other  obligations provided in this Section 5.9.

 

 

(e) The  rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not  in  limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the  certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other  indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.
The provisions of this  Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are  intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each
of the Indemnified  Parties.

 

 

(f) In  the  event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors  or  assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not  be  the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or  merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets  to any person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made  so  that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as  the  case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section  5.9.

 

 

Section  5.10. _Control  of Operations_.  Nothing  contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the  right  to control
or direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior  to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms  and 
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its 
operations.

 

 

Section  5.11. _Financing_.

 

 

(a) Parent  and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Financing  on  the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Commitments, including  using  its reasonable best efforts (i) to negotiate
definitive agreements with respect  thereto on the terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Commitments,  (ii)  to satisfy all conditions on
a timely basis to obtaining the Financing  applicable to Parent and Merger
Sub set forth in such definitive agreements  that  are within its control,
(iii) to comply with its obligations under the Debt  Commitment Letter and
(iv) to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment  Letter. Parent shall
give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of  any  material breach
by any party of the Financing Commitments or any termination  of  the
Financing Commitments. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a 
reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to 
arrange the Debt Financing and shall not permit any amendment or
modification  to  be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or
remedy under, the Debt  Commitment Letter except as expressly permitted by
Section 4.5. In the event  that Parent becomes aware of any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

event  or  circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the
Financing unlikely  to  occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated
in the Financing  Commitments, Parent shall immediately notify the Company
and Parent and Merger  Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to arrange any such  portion from alternative sources (such portion from
alternate sources, the  " _Alternative  Financing_ ")  on  terms and
conditions, taken as a whole, no less favorable to Parent or Merger  Sub (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent and Merger Sub).  The "
_Marketing  Period_ " for  the  Debt Financing shall mean a period of 20
consecutive business days after  the  Initiation Date throughout which (1)
Parent and Merger Sub shall have all  the  Required Financial Information
and all such information and data remains  current, and (2) the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.1(b) and 6.1(c)(i)  are  and remain satisfied and
nothing has occurred and no condition exists that  would  reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section  6.3  to fail
to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any  time 
during such 20 consecutive business day period. For purposes of this
Agreement,  " _Initiation  Date_ " shall  mean the fifth business day
after the date that the Proxy Statement is first  mailed to a stockholder of
the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, in the  event  that (x) all or any
portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield  financing or real
estate securitization financing has not been consummated  notwithstanding
that the last day of the Marketing Period shall have occurred,  (y) all
closing conditions contained in Article VI (other than those contained  in
Sections 6.2(c) and 6.3(c)) shall have been satisfied or waived and (z) 
the  bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or
alternative  bridge financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement) and
the proceeds  thereof are available on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt  Commitment Letter (or replacement thereof), then Parent and Merger
Sub shall  cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used to replace
such high  yield financing or real estate financing on the Closing pursuant
to the proviso  to Section 1.2.

 

 

 

(b) The  Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and
shall use  its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives
(including  legal and accounting) to provide, at Parent's sole expense, all
cooperation  reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
the Financing  or any Alternative Financing, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i)  cause, upon reasonable advance notice by Parent and on a
reasonable number  of  occasions, appropriate officers and employees to be
available on a customary  basis for meetings, including management and other
presentations and "road show" appearances, participation in drafting and due
diligence sessions, and the  preparation of disclosure documents in
connection with any such financing,  _provided_   that any  private
placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to high yield debt 
securities need not be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior  to  the Effective Time, _provided_ _further_   that any  such
memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements 
with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the 
Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; (ii) cause its 
independent accountants and legal counsel to provide assistance to Parent
and  Merger Sub (including providing customary comfort) for fees consistent
with  the  Company's existing arrangements with such accountants and legal
counsel; (iii)  furnish Parent and Merger Sub (which they may furnish to, and
share with, their  financing sources) as promptly as practicable with such
financial and other  pertinent information as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub,  including the Core Financial Information
(collectively, the " _Required  Financial Information_ ")  (for  purposes
hereof, " _Core  Financial Information_ " shall  mean all financial
statements and financial data of the type required by  Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (other than Rule  3-10  of
Regulation S-X) and of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

type  and  form, and for the periods, customarily included in private
placements under  Rule  144A of the Securities Act to consummate the
offerings of high yield debt  securities contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (including replacements  or  restatements thereof, and supplements
thereto, if any such information would  go  stale or otherwise being
unusable for such purpose and in the case of annual  financial statements,
the auditors' report thereon) at the time during the  Company's fiscal year
such offerings will be made); (iv) cooperate with the  marketing efforts of
Parent, Merger Sub and their financing sources for any  portion of the
financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and  assist  Parent,
Merger Sub and their financing sources in the timely preparation  of 
offering documents and similar documents and materials for lender and rating 
agency presentations; (v) in connection with any real estate financing 
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, allow Parent, Merger Sub and 
their  financing sources to perform reasonable and customary due diligence
related  to  such properties, including appropriate appraisals, surveys, and
Phase 1  environmental assessments and other reasonable inspections and
diligence  (and  documentation), including as shall be necessary to comply
with any necessary  rating agencies' requirements; (vi) satisfy the
conditions precedent set forth  in the Debt Commitment Letter (to the extent
within the control of the Company  or requiring action or cooperation by the
Company); and (vii) obtain  accountants' comfort letters, surveys and title
insurance as reasonably  requested by Parent; _provided_   that (x)  none
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any 
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection 
with  the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time, and (y) such
requested  cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of  the  Company and its subsidiaries. For purposes of this
Section 5.11, the term "Debt  Financing" shall also be deemed to include any
Alternative Financing and the  term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall also be
deemed to include any commitment  letter (or similar agreement) with respect
to such Alternative  Financing.

In  the  event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1, this  Agreement shall terminate (except for the Confidentiality
Agreement referred  to  in Section 5.2 and the provisions of Sections 7.2
and 8.2 through 8.14), and  there shall be no other liability on the part of
the Company or Parent to the  other except, subject to Section 7.2(d),
liability arising out of an intentional  breach of this Agreement or as
provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement,  in  which case the aggrieved
party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies  available at law or in
equity.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Actions  taken by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall be taken by
the Special  Committee if then in existence.

 

 

Section  7.2. _Termination  Fees_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  any provision in this Agreement to the contrary if:

 

 

(i) (A)  this  Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(b) and (B)  concurrently with or within nine (9) months after such
termination, any  definitive agreement providing for a Qualifying Transaction
shall have been  entered into that provides a value per Share not less than
the Merger  Consideration,

 

 

(ii) (A)  prior  to the termination of this Agreement, any Alternative
Proposal (substituting  50%  for the 25% threshold set forth in the
definition of Alternative Proposal)  or  the bona fide intention of any
Person to make an Alternative Proposal (a " _Qualifying  Transaction_ ") 
is  publicly proposed or publicly disclosed or otherwise made known to the
Company  prior to, and not withdrawn at the time of, the Company Meeting, (B)
this  Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)  and  (C) concurrently with or within nine (9) months after such
termination, any  definitive agreement providing for a Qualifying Transaction
shall have been  entered into and in any instance such Qualifying Transaction
shall have been  consummated,

 

 

(iii) this  Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g)
on or prior  to  the Solicitation Period End Date, or

 

 

(iv) this  Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g)
after the  Solicitation Period End Date,

 

 

then  the  Company shall (a) in the case of clause (i), reimburse Parent for
the documented  out-of-pocket fees and expenses reasonably incurred by it in
connection with  this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an  aggregate amount not to exceed $7.5 million in cash; (b) in
the case of clause  (ii), pay to (or as directed by) Parent a fee of $45
million in cash; (c)  in  the case of clause (iii), pay  to  (or as
directed by) Parent a fee of $25 million in cash and reimburse Parent  for 
the documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses reasonably incurred by it in 
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement in an aggregate amount not to exceed $7.5 million in cash; or (d) 
in  the case of clause (iv), pay  to  (or as directed by) Parent a fee of
$45 million in cash (each of such payments,  the " _Company  Termination
Fee_ ").

 

 

The  Company Termination Fee shall be paid: (a) in the case of clause (i), on
the  date such definitive agreement is entered into; (b) in the case of
clause (ii),  on the date such Qualifying Transaction is consummated; and (c)
in the case  of  clauses (iii) and (iv), on the date this Agreement is
terminated by the Company,  in each case by wire transfer of same day funds
as directed by Parent reasonably  in advance. Upon payment of the Company
Termination Fee, the Company shall  have  no further liability with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement to
Parent or its stockholders. Notwithstanding  any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall the Company  be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee referred to in this Section  7.2  on more than one
occasion.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) In  the  event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to (i) Section  7.1(b) and the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.3
would have been  satisfied had the Closing been scheduled on the End Date or
(ii) Section 7.1(h),  then Parent or its affiliates shall pay $45 million
(the " _Parent  Termination Fee_ ")  to the  Company or as directed by the
Company as promptly as reasonably practicable  (and, in any event, within two
(2) business days following such termination),  payable by wire transfer of
same day funds. Under no circumstances shall the  Parent Termination Fee be
payable more than once pursuant to this Section  7.2(b).

 

 

(c) Any  payment made pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall be net of any
amounts as may  be  required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Code or under any  provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.

 

 

(d) Each  of  the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
agreements contained  in  this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent  would have entered into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant  to  this Section 7.2 do
not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay as  directed in writing
by Parent any amounts due to accounts designated by Parent  pursuant to this
Section 7.2 within the time periods specified in this Section  7.2 or Parent
fails to pay the Company any amounts due to the Company pursuant  to this
Section 7.2 within the time periods specified in this Section 7.2,  the 
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay the costs and expenses
(including  reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent or the
Company, as  applicable, in connection with any action, including the filing
of any lawsuit,  taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with
interest on such unpaid  amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during
such period as published  in  _The  Wall Street Journal_ ,  calculated on
a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be  paid  until
the date of actual payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in 
this Agreement, the Company agrees that (other than in the case of fraud)
(i)  the Company's right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee
from Parent  pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.2 (and the Guaranteed
Amount from the  Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantees) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy  available to the Company, its affiliates and its
Subsidiaries against Parent,  Merger Sub, the Guarantors and any of their
respective former, current, or  future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors,  officers, affiliates or agents
in the event that it has incurred any losses  or  damages, or suffered any
harm, with respect to this Agreement or the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any loss suffered as  a  result of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated), and upon payment of  the  Parent Termination
Fee, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any of  their respective
former, current, or future general or limited partners,  stockholders,
managers, members, directors, officers, affiliates or agents  shall  have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this 
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
theory  for any reason (except for intentional breach of this Agreement, as
set forth  in  subclause (ii)), (ii) in the case of any intentional breach
of this Agreement  (and irrespective of whether the Parent Termination Fee
has been paid), Parent  and Guarantors shall in no event collectively
(whether or not this Agreement  shall have been terminated) be directly or
indirectly liable for losses and  damages arising from or in connection with
such intentional breach in an  aggregate amount in excess of $215,000,000
(the " _Guaranteed  Amount_ ")  (for  the avoidance of doubt, if Parent (or
the Guarantors) pay a Parent Termination  Fee, such fee shall be included in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  calculation of such aggregate amount), (iii) the maximum liability of
each  Guarantor, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the express
obligations  of such Guarantor under its Guarantee, and (iv) in no event
(other than in  the  case of fraud) shall the Company, its affiliates or
Subsidiaries seek or  be  entitled to recover any money damages in the
aggregate in excess of the  Guaranteed Amount from Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantor, or any of their  respective former, current, or future general or
limited partners, stockholders,  managers, members, directors, officers,
affiliates or agents.

that  Merger Sub may designate, by written notice to the Company, a
Subsidiary that  is  wholly owned by Merger Sub to be merged with and into
the Company in lieu of  Merger Sub, in which event this Agreement will be
amended such that all  references in this Agreement to Merger Sub will be
deemed references to such  Subsidiary, and in that case, and pursuant to such
amendment, all  representations and warranties made in this Agreement with
respect to Merger  Sub  will be deemed representations and warranties made
with respect to such  Subsidiary as of the date of such designation and
Parent and Merger Sub may,  without the prior written consent of the other
parties, assign any or all of  their respective rights and interests
hereunder to one or more of its  affiliates, designate one or more of its
affiliates to perform its obligations  hereunder, in each case, so long as

preceding sentence, this Agreement shall  be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their  respective successors and
assigns.

 

 

Section  8.9. _Severability_.  Any  term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any  jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of  such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable  the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction;  _provided_
  that, if  any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such  provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable and,  _provided_ ,  _further_   that  upon a determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or  incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith  to  modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as  closely as

contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible

constitute  the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements
and  understandings, both written and oral, between the parties or their
affiliates,  or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and  thereof  and, except for the provisions of Sections 2.1
(after such time as the Exchange  Fund has been returned to the Company from
the Paying Agent) and 5.9 (which  in  each case shall inure to the benefit
of the persons benefiting therefrom  who are  intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof), is not intended to and  shall  not confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies  hereunder. No
representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding  or  condition
not set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied upon by  any of  the
parties hereto.

 

 

 

Section  8.11. _Amendments;  Waivers_.  At any  time prior to the
Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended  or waived if,
and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,  in  the
case of an amendment, by the Company (acting through the Special Committee, 
if then in existence), Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver, by 
the  party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any
such amendment or waiver  shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules and regulations of  the  New York Stock Exchange require further
approval of the stockholders of the  Company, the effectiveness of such
amendment or waiver shall be subject to  the  approval of the stockholders
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no  failure or delay by the
Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder  shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise  thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right  hereunder.

Agreement are for convenience  of  the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect  whatsoever. The table of contents to this
