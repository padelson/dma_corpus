---|---|--- 

(b) Other than those Liabilities specifically identified as the Assumed

SECTION 2.04. _Consents of Third Parties_. (a) Prior to and following the

faith and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents,
waivers or approvals listed on _Schedule 4.03_ and _Schedule 2.04(e)_ , in
each case in a form, satisfactory to Purchaser (the " _Consents/Waivers_ ").
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any contract or asset or any claim
or right or any benefit arising under or resulting from such contract or
asset if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a third
party, would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such
third party or would give the counterparty the right to terminate or modify
the terms or payment terms of such contract. If any transfer or assignment by
Seller to, or any assumption by Purchaser of, any interest in, or liability,
obligation or commitment under, any contract or asset requires the consent or
waiver of a third party, then such assignment or assumption shall be made
subject to such consent or waiver being obtained.

 



-16-  (b) If any Consent/Waiver is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate in any lawful and reasonable arrangement reasonably
proposed by Purchaser under which Purchaser shall obtain the economic claims,
rights and benefits under the contract, asset, claim or right with respect to
which the Consent/Waiver has not been obtained in accordance with this
Agreement (" _Alternative Arrangements_ "). Such Alternative Arrangements may
include, but shall not be limited to: (i) the subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing to Purchaser of any and all rights of Seller under the contract
for which the Consent/Waiver is required, and Seller providing Purchaser with
all of the rights and benefits under such contract, and (ii) the enforcement
by Seller (on behalf of Purchaser) of all rights that would have been enjoyed
by Purchaser had such Consent/Waiver been obtained. Notwithstanding the form
of Consent/Waiver requested by Seller and Purchaser from the counterparty to a
contract that is not a Designated Contract, Seller shall not be obligated to
provide Alternative Arrangements if the counterparty to such contract consents
to the assignment of such contract to Purchaser and waives any right to
terminate such contract arising of the assignment to Purchaser and
Purchaser rejects such consent and waiver.

(c) Seller shall provide any Alternative Arrangement proposed by Purchaser
with respect to each contract that is not a Designated Contract until the
earlier of (i) one (1) year from the Closing Date, (ii) the date that such
contract expires (after giving effect to any automatic renewals or extensions
or contractual rights to renew or extend, not exceeding one year in length,
arising and effective prior to June 30, 2011), (iii) the date such contract is
terminated by Purchaser or by the counterparty to such contract pursuant to a
contractual right to terminate contained in such contract on the date hereof
and not related to or arising from a breach of such contract by Seller or the
use of an Alternative Arrangement (a " _Qualified Counterparty Termination_ ")
and (iv) if a Recurring Breach has occurred with respect to the Alternative
Arrangement. A " _Recurring Breach_ " will have occurred with respect to an
Alternative Arrangement if in a twelve month period there has occurred three
or more (in the aggregate) of either of the following (i) Purchaser breaches
any material non-payment obligation in this Section 2.04 with respect to such
Alternative Arrangement and such breach is not cured within 3 Business Days
after Purchaser has received written notice of such breach from Sellers or
(ii) Purchaser breaches its obligation to pay when due an amount owing to
Seller (other than amounts being disputed in good faith) pursuant to the
related Alternative Arrangement and the terms of this Section 2.04 and such
breach is not cured within 3 Business Days after Purchaser receives written
notice of such breach from Seller. Seller shall provide any Alternative
Arrangement proposed by Purchaser with respect to each Designated Contract
until the earlier of (i) twenty four (24) months from the Closing Date, (ii)
the date that such Designated Contract expires (after giving effect to any
renewals or extensions of such Designated Contract), (iii) the date such
Designated Contract is terminated by Purchaser or by the counterparty to such
Designated Contract pursuant to a Qualified Counterparty Termination, and (iv)
a Recurring Breach has occurred with respect to the Alternative Arrangement.
If Seller believes that any Alternative Arrangement is unreasonable, Purchaser
will consider in good faith other Alternative Arrangements suggested by Seller
so long as such other Alternative Arrangements satisfy Sellers obligations
under this Section 2.04 and provide Purchaser with the rights and benefits of
the underlying contract in accordance with the terms of such contract as in
effect and enforced on the date hereof.

 



-17-  (d) The Purchase Price shall not be reduced or increased by reason of the non-
assignability or subcontracting of any Contract. In connection with each
Alternative Arrangement, Purchaser shall pay Seller in good funds any and all
amounts required to be paid by Seller to the counterparty pursuant to the
underlying contract at least one business day in advance of the date that
Seller would be required to pay such amount to the counterparty in accordance
with the terms of the underlying Contract as in effect and enforced on the
date hereof. Except in cases where Purchaser receives notice of an amount due
from the counterparty, Seller shall give Purchaser written notice of amounts
required to be paid by Seller to the counterparty under a contract at least 10
days prior to the date such amount is required to be paid by Purchaser to
Seller pursuant to this Section 2.04. If a Recurring Breach has occurred in
connection with more than one Alternative Arrangement , then Seller shall have
the right to terminate all Alternative Arrangements and shall have no further
obligations with respect thereto. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
enforce the terms of the Designated Contracts during the period that Seller is
required to provide Alternative Arrangements for such Designated Contracts
pursuant to clause (c) above, so that during such period Purchaser will have
the benefit of the terms and benefits under such Designated Contracts as in
effect on the date hereof (which efforts for purposes of this clause shall
include, but not be limited to, filing and actively pursuing lawsuits against
the counterparties to such Designated Contracts but shall not include the
payment of any money to the counterparty in connection to the enforcement of
the Alternative Arrangement whether to settle a suit or claim or otherwise).
The actions taken by Seller pursuant to the prior sentence shall be taken at
its own cost. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this clause (d),
Purchaser shall not be required to pay Seller for any amounts payable as a
result of an Alternative Arrangement resulting in a breach of the underlying
contract unless such breach is due Purchasers breach of it obligation in this
Section 2.04.

 

(e) If, in connection with obtaining any Consent/Waiver, any of the
counterparties set forth on Schedule 2.04(e) require, whether before or after
Closing, a change in the terms of their existing contract or relationship with
Seller (the " _Designated Contracts_ ") (other than payment terms, which are
addressed in the following sentence) which change adversely impacts
the economic arrangement of such Designated Contract or the Business, and
Purchaser, in its reasonable discretion, determines not to accept such change,
then Purchaser shall not be obligated to accept such changed terms and Seller
shall provide an Alternative Arrangement proposed by Purchaser in accordance
with this Section 2.04 with respect to such Designated Contract. If, in
connection with obtaining a Consent/Waiver related to any Designated Contract
or if at any time prior to or within 5 months after obtaining the
Consent/Waiver related to a Designated Contract, the counterparty to such
Designated Contracts requires that the payment terms that are in effect on the
date hereof be changed or requires that additional security be provided in
order to maintain the payment terms that are in effect on the date hereof,
then Seller, in its sole discretion, shall either (x) continue an Alternative
Arrangements proposed by Purchaser in accordance with this Section
2.04 without a change to such payment terms to Purchaser, or (y) provide a
letter of credit, guaranty or such other financial instrument on Purchasers
behalf as additional security in an amount and type required by such
counterparty so that there is no change in such payment terms to Purchaser.
In the case of the Conoco Phillips , the prior sentence shall apply if Conoco
Phillips requires revised payment terms or additional security within five
months of being notified of this transaction. If the Seller provides a letter
of credit or other instrument pursuant to the prior sentence, then the
Purchaser will pay the fees

 



-18-   incurred by Seller in providing such financial instrument and will reimburse
Seller for any amounts drawn on such financial instrument as a result of
Purchasers failure to pay amounts due within three (3) Business days.

(f) Seller agrees to Indemnify Purchaser for any Loss incurred or suffered by
Purchaser in connection with any Proceeding by a counterparty to a contract
that is related to or arises from either (i) the failure to obtain a
Consent/Waiver prior to Closing or (ii) claims that an Alternative Arrangement
used in connection with such contract result in a breach of such contract, or
is ineffective to transfer rights and benefits of the contract to Purchaser.

(g) If for any reason Seller is not able to provide Purchaser with the
benefits under any Designated Contract after the Closing and Purchaser
purchases or leases the product or service previously provided under such
Designated Contract pursuant to a new contract or arrangement and if such new
contract or arrangement includes payment terms that are less favorable to
Purchaser than the payment terms under the Designated Contract, then Seller
shall either x) provide a letter of credit, guaranty or such other financial
instrument on Purchasers behalf as additional security in an amount and type
required by such counterparty so that Purchaser is able to obtain the same
payment terms under such contract or arrangement as were available under the
Designated Contract, or (y) indemnify Purchaser for any Losses related to or
arising from such change in payment terms.

 

(h) Unless the Seller and Purchaser agree otherwise, Seller agrees to (i)
comply with and not amend or terminate or waive any right, or take any other
action not in the ordinary course under, such contracts, or engage in
discussions with the counterparty to such contracts related to any of the
foregoing, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent may
be given or withheld in Purchasers sole discretion and (ii) order product,
and take all other actions under such contracts only pursuant to Purchasers
directions (including, if requested by Purchaser, extending or renewing such
contracts during the period the Seller is required to provide Alternative
Arrangements with respect to such contract), provided that (i) if a Recurring
Breach has occurred in connection with more than one Alternative Arrangement
then this section will not apply, and (ii) if Purchaser is in breach of any
of its other obligations under this Section 2.04 that prevents Seller from
providing an Alternative Arrangement, then Seller shall be excused from
providing such Alternative Arrangement until such breach is cured.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, Seller shall, at any time upon Purchasers
written request, assign its rights under any such contract to the Purchaser
for no additional consideration. So long as any Alternative Arrangement is in
place each of Seller and Purchaser shall promptly forward to the other any
notices or other material communications received from the counterparty under
the related underlying contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this section 2.04 if (i) Purchaser breaches any non-payment obligation,
whether material or otherwise, in this Section 2.04 with respect to any
Alternative Arrangement that prevents Seller from providing an Alternative
Arrangement and such breach is not cured within 3 Business Days after
Purchaser has received written notice of such breach from Seller, or (ii)
Purchaser breaches its obligation to pay when due an amount owing to Seller
(other than amounts being disputed in good faith) pursuant to any Alternative
Arrangement and such breach is not cured within 3 Business Days after
Purchaser receives written notice of such breach from Seller, then in either
case Seller shall 

 



-19-   have the right to immediately suspend such Alternative Arrangement until
Purchaser has cured all such breaches with respect to such Alternative
Arrangement.

 

(i) So long as any Alternative Arrangement is in effect, Purchaser shall not
(a) declare or pay any dividend or distribution on account of any capital
stock or other equity interests of Purchaser, other than dividends or
distributions payable solely in the capital stock or other securities of
Purchaser, (b) make (or permit any Subsidiary to make) any other payments
to any Affiliate of Purchaser, including, without limitation, any payment for
management fees, consulting services or similar payments, provided, however,
that the following shall be permitted: (i) the payment of an annual management
fee to HIG not to exceed the greater of (A) $750,000, and (B) 1.5% of the
Purchasers EBITDA, annually, (ii) payments to HIG to reimburse HIG for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its activities
related to Purchaser, including without limitation fees paid to third party
professional service providers such as attorneys and accountants, (iii) other
payments pursuant to transactions on terms no less favorable to the Purchaser
than would be usual and customary in similar transactions with non-affiliated
persons, (iv) distributions for the purchase, redemption or acquisition of up
to 5% in the aggregate during the term hereof of equity interests from any of
the Purchasers or its Subsidiaries present or former directors, officers or
employees (other than directors, officers and employees who are also
directors, officers or employees of HIG), and (v) any payment to a holder of
senior debt associated with the purchase, redemption or acquisition of
warrants or other similar equity interests from such holder of senior debt.

(j) If, pursuant to an Alternative Arrangement, Seller accepts an order from
a customer in accordance with Purchasers instruction and Purchaser fails to
provide such product in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract,
then Purchaser, at or prior to the time such payment is payable to such
customer, shall reimburse Seller for any amounts payable to such customer or
out of pocket expenses directly related thereto.

(k) Purchaser agrees to indemnify Seller for any Losses incurred by Seller
related to or arising from actions taken by Seller under the Alternative
Arrangements in accordance with Purchasers written directions provided that
Purchaser shall have no indemnification obligation for any Losses arising from
or to (i) the failure to obtain the Consent/Waiver of any contract prior to
Closing, (ii) matters which, pursuant to the other terms of this Section
2.04, are Sellers obligation or liability, (iii) any claim or Proceeding by a
counterparty alleging that the Alternative Arrangement breaches or violates
the underlying contract, or (iv) actions taken by Seller that were
inconsistent with Purchasers written directions or that breach any of
Sellers obligations under this Agreement.

(l) If Purchaser breaches its obligation to pay when due an amount owing to
Seller (other than amounts being disputed in good faith) pursuant to an
Alternative Arrangement and the terms of this Section 2.04 that is not cured
within 5 Business Days after Purchaser receives written notice of such breach
from Seller, then Seller shall have the right to offset an amount equal to
such uncured payment default against amounts owed to Purchaser for melamine
and acrylonitrile purchases.

 



-20-  (m) Purchaser agrees that to the extent that the ability of Seller to satisfy
any of its obligations under any Alternative Arrangement is dependent on the
use of Acquired Assets or actions of Acquired Employees, Purchaser shall make
such Acquired Assets and Acquired Employees available to Purchaser at no cost
so long as the use of such Acquired Assets or Acquired Employees does not
unreasonably interfere with Purchasers operation of the Business.

(n) Seller shall not be obligated to take any action under any Alternative
Arrangement at the direction of the Purchaser that it reasonable believes is
in violation of the contract subject to such Alternative Arrangements unless
it has received an indemnity from Purchaser in connection therewith provided
that this clause (n) shall not apply to (and Purchaser shall not be required
to provide any additional indemnity related to) entering into any of the
Alternative Arrangements or engaging in normal activities under the contract
consistent with Sellers past practices pursuant to an Alternative
Arrangement.

 

SECTION 2.05. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) _Working Capital Adjustment_. The cash portion of the Purchase Price shall
be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent that Closing Net
Working Capital (as defined and determined as specified below) is greater
than $4.2 million (" _Target Net Working Capital_ ") and decreased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent that Closing Net Working Capital is less
than Target Net Working Capital. As used herein, "Closing Net Working
Capital" shall mean the amount by which (i) the Acquired Assets that are
current assets on the Closing Date (excluding cash, cash equivalents, VAT
receivables, deferred charges, Inventory and any amounts owed by Seller or
any of its Affiliates to the Business) (determined in accordance with the
Accounting Principles) exceed (ii) the Assumed Liabilities that are current
liabilities on the Closing Date (excluding accrued real estate taxes paid by
Seller at the Closing and $1,677,000 of accrued vacation for Fortier
bargaining employees (with any excess accrued vacation Liability being
included as a current liability) and any amounts owed to Seller or any of its
Affiliates from the Business) (determined in accordance with the Accounting
Principles).

(b) _Inventory Adjustment_. The cash portion of the Purchase Price shall also
be increased by the amount of any Aggregate Inventory Surplus (as defined and
determined below) or decreased by the amount of any Aggregate Inventory
Deficiency (as defined and determined below). For each category of
Inventory identified on _Schedule 2.05_ (each, an " _Inventory Category_ "),
the following amounts shall be calculated:

(i) if (x) the number of pounds or tons, as applicable, of inventory of such
Inventory Category at Closing less (y) applicable reserves (expressed in
pounds or tons, as applicable) established in accordance with the Accounting
Principles (for each Inventory Category, its " _Closing Inventory Amount_ ")
is greater than the "Target Closing Inventory Amount" identified for such
Inventory Category on _Schedule 2.05_ (its " _Target Closing Inventory
Amount_ "), the cash portion of the Purchase Price shall be increased by an
amount (such amount, if any, the " _Inventory Surplus Value_ ") equal to (i)
the difference between the Closing Inventory Amount for such Inventory
Category and the Target Closing Inventory Amount for such Inventory Category
multiplied by (ii) the average Applicable Cost for such Inventory Category 

 



-21-   during the one hundred twenty (120) day period prior to the Closing (for
each Inventory Category, its " _Pre-Closing Applicable Cost_ ");

 

(ii) if the Closing Inventory Amount for such Inventory Category is less than
the Target Closing Inventory Amount for such Inventory Category, the cash
portion of the Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount (such amount, if
any, the " _Inventory Deficiency Value_ ") equal to (i) the difference between
the Closing Inventory Amount for such Inventory Category and the Target
Closing Inventory Amount for such Inventory Category multiplied by (ii) the
Pre-Closing Applicable Cost for such Inventory Category;

(iii) if the sum of all of the Inventory Surplus Values is greater than the
sum of all of the Inventory Deficiency Values, then such excess shall be the "
_Aggregate Inventory Surplus_ "); and

(iv) if the sum of all of the Inventory Deficiency Values is greater than the
sum of all of the Inventory Surplus Values, then such excess shall be the "
_Aggregate Inventory Deficiency_ ").

As used herein, the " _Applicable Cost_ " of each Inventory Category shall
mean cost of such item (on a per pound or ton, as applicable, basis) that
would be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles.

 

(b-1) _Miscellaneous Inventory Adjustment_. The cash portion of the Purchase
Price shall also be (i) increased by the amount by which (A) the net book
value of Inventory (excluding (1) any Inventory reflected as deferred charges
(such as maintenance and spare parts) in the Financial Statements and (2)
Inventory included in the following Inventory Categories: Melamine,
Acrylonitrile, Sulfuric Acid, Propylene, Ammonia and Sulfur) at Closing
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles (" _Miscellaneous
Inventory Value_ ") exceeds (B) Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000); and (ii)
decreased by the amount by which (A) the Miscellaneous Inventory Value is less
than (B) Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000).

(c) _Pre Closing Estimates_. Not later than five Business Days prior to the
expected Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (i) a certificate
setting forth the Sellers good faith estimate of the Closing Net Working
Capital and the components thereof, the Closing Inventory Amount for each
Inventory Category, the Pre-Closing Applicable Cost of each Inventory
Category, the Inventory Deficit Value or Inventory Surplus Value for each
Inventory Category, the Aggregate Inventory Surplus, if any, or the Aggregate
Inventory Deficiency, if any, and based on such estimates, Sellers
calculation of the Closing Payment (the " _Estimated Closing Payment_ "),
in each case based upon a reasonably detailed and good faith estimate of
Closing Net Working Capital and such other financial information relating to
the Business as may be reasonably available prior thereto and (ii) the work
papers used by Seller to calculate such amounts. As used herein, the "
_Closing Payment_ " shall mean the (v) Cash Amount plus (w) the amount, if
any, by which Closing Net Working Capital exceeds Target Net Working Capital,
minus (x) the amount, if any, by which Target Net Working Capital exceeds
Closing Net Working Capital, plus (y) the Aggregate Inventory Surplus, if any,
minus (z) the Aggregate Inventory Deficiency, if any.

 



-22-  (d) _Estimated Closing Payment_. On the Closing Date Purchaser shall pay to
Seller the Estimated Closing Payment; provided, if the Estimated Closing
Payment exceeds the Cash Amount by more than $5,000,000, then (i) at the
Closing the Purchaser shall pay Seller the Cash Amount plus $5,000,000 and
(ii) Purchaser shall pay the excess to Seller on July 1, 2011 (the "
_Deferred Payment_ "). Purchaser shall make the Deferred Payment by wire
transfer in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon at the
Applicable Rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

(e) _Post Closing Statement_. Within 90 days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Statement_
") setting forth Purchasers calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and
the components thereof, the Closing Inventory Amount for each Inventory
Category, the Pre-Closing Applicable Cost of each Inventory Category, the
Inventory Deficit Value or Inventory Surplus Value for each Inventory
Category, the Aggregate Inventory Surplus (if any) or the Aggregate Inventory
Deficiency (if any), and based on such amounts, Purchasers calculation of the
Closing Payment. Seller shall assist Purchaser in the preparation of the
Statement and each Party shall provide the other Party access at
all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records of the
Business (to the extent within the control of such Party) for such purpose. At
Purchasers option, a physical inventory shall be conducted by Seller
consistent with past practice and in accordance with the Accounting
Principles on or before the Closing Date for the purpose of determining the
Closing Inventory Amount of each Inventory Category, and each of Seller and
Purchaser and their respective independent auditors shall have the right to
observe the taking of such physical inventory. Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller for fifty percent (50%) of the fees payable by Sellers to their
independent accountants in connection with completing such
physical inventory.

(f) _Notice of Disagreement; Resolution_. The Statement provided by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.05(e) shall become final and binding upon the parties
on the earlier of (i) the date on which Seller advises Purchaser that it
agrees with the Statement or (ii) the 30th day following delivery thereof,
unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a
" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Purchaser prior to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement
so asserted and Sellers proposed calculation of Closing Net Working Capital
and the components thereof, the Closing Inventory Amount for each Inventory
Category, the Pre-Closing Applicable Cost of each Inventory Category, the
Inventory Deficit Value or Inventory Surplus Value for each Inventory
Category, the Aggregate Inventory Surplus (if any) and Aggregate Inventory
Deficiency (if any), and based on such amounts, Sellers calculation of the
Closing Payment. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Purchaser within
such 30-day period, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this
sentence) shall become final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the
earlier of (i) the date Seller and Purchaser resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement or (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in
writing by the Accounting Firm (as defined below). During the 30-day period
following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser
shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If such
disputed matters have not been resolved prior to the end of

 



-23-   such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall submit to a mutually agreed
upon regional or national public accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ")
for determination any and all matters that remain in dispute and were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement; provided, that such
determination by the Accounting Firm shall (A) be based on the Accounting
Principles and (B) be no more favorable to Purchaser than as proposed in its
Statement or no more favorable to Seller than as proposed in its Notice of
Disagreement. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be shared
equally by Purchaser and Seller. The final Closing Payment as
determined pursuant to this Section 2.05, shall be referred to as the "
_Final Closing Payment_."

(g) _Post Closing Payment_. If (i) the Final Closing Payment exceeds the
Estimated Closing Payment, Purchaser shall, and (ii) if the Estimated Closing
Payment exceeds the Final Closing Payment, Seller shall, within five Business
Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the parties, make
payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of such
difference, together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate, calculated
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from the
Closing Date to the date of payment.

(h) _Target Net Working Capital_. For purposes of calculating the Final
Closing Payment, if, for the period from January 1, 2011, through February 28,
2011, the amount of CAPEX exceeds $8.3 million, then the Target Net Working
Capital shall be decreased by such excess amount (the " _CAPEX Adjustment_
"). For purposes of calculating the CAPEX Adjustment, (except as set forth
below, the amount of CAPEX shall include all capital expenditures with respect
to the turnaround of the sulfuric acid unit and all other capital
expenditures incurred by the Seller, including, but not limited to turnaround
maintenance and turnaround capital. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of
CAPEX shall not include (i) any amounts related to the melamine or
acrylonitrile turnarounds nor (ii) the monthly turnaround amortization
expense. The CAPEX Adjustment shall not exceed $2.2 million. The Seller agrees
to complete all turnaround and related activities, including the production
and sale of inventory, in accordance with its existing turnaround plan and its
past practices.

(i) _Post Closing Changes_. Following the Closing, any action taken by
Purchaser with respect to the accounting books and records of the Business on
which the Statement is to be based that are not consistent with the
Accounting Principles shall not be taken into account when determining Closing
Net Working Capital or the Closing Inventory Amount. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, any change made in any reserve or other
account existing as of the date of the Statement that is not consistent with
the Accounting Principles shall not be taken into account when determining
Closing Net Working Capital or the Closing Inventory Amount.

_Representations and Warranties of Seller_

Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser that, except as set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule, which exceptions shall be deemed to be part
of the representations and warranties made hereunder, the following
representations are true and complete as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date, except where representations and warranties are made explicitly
with respect to a specific date (in which case such representations or
warranty shall be true and complete as of such date). The Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and subsections contained in this Article IV, and the
disclosures in any section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule shall
qualify other sections and subsections in this Article IV only to the extent
it is reasonably apparent from a reading of the disclosure (without knowledge
of any facts not set forth on the face of such disclosure) that such
disclosure is applicable to such other sections and subsections. For the
avoidance of doubt, the representations and warranties in this Article IV with
respect to "Seller"

 



-27-   shall be deemed to be made with respect to each of Seller and the Seller
Transferors for purposes of this Article IV, Section 7.02 and 9.01, unless the
context clearly provides otherwise. 

SECTION 4.01. _Organization. Standing and Power_. Seller is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
formation and has the requisite corporate power and authority and possesses
all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct the Business and its other businesses as presently
conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect. Seller is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the character of the Acquired Assets held by it or the
nature of the Business make such qualification necessary for it to conduct
the Business as currently conducted by it, except where the failure to so
qualify has not, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, had a
Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 4.02. _Authority: Execution and Delivery: Enforceability_. Seller has
full power and authority to execute this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents to which it is, or is specified to be, a party and to consummate the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to which it is, or is specified to be, a party and the
consummation by Seller of the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action. Seller has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and
prior to the Closing Seller will have duly executed and delivered each
Transaction Document to which it is a party, and this Agreement constitutes,
and each Transaction Document to which Seller is a party will as of the
Closing constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that the
enforceability of Sellers obligations may be subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

SECTION 4.03. _No Conflicts: Consents._ The execution and delivery by Seller
of this Agreement do not, the execution and delivery by Seller of each
Transaction Document to which it is a party will not, and the consummation of
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and compliance by Seller with the terms hereof and thereof will not,
result in a breach, violation or default under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of, or create in any party the right
to accelerate, terminate, modify, or cancel, or require any notice or payment
under or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Acquired Assets
under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Seller, (ii) any material Assigned Contract or (iii) any Judgment or
Applicable Law. No material Consent from any Person, including under any
Assigned Contracts, is required to be obtained or made by Seller or any Seller
Transferor in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document to which it is a party or the
consummation of the Acquisition or the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby,

 



-28-   other than consents required under Assigned Contracts and Assigned Permits
that are listed on _Schedule 4.03_ or _Schedule 2.04(e)_.

 

SECTION 4.04. _Financial Statements._

(a) Attached as part of _Schedule 4.04(a)_ are pro forma unaudited statements
of assets and liabilities of the Business to be sold as of December 31, 2010,
2009 and 2008, and the related unaudited statements of income for the
Business to be sold for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2010, and 2009
(the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements fairly present in
all material respects the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Business to be sold as of the dates
and for the periods indicated. The information used in the preparation of the
Financial Statements (the " _Underlying Information_ ") was derived from
Sellers general ledger and has been recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), consistently
applied. The Financial Statement balances for assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are included in the Sellers
consolidated financial statements. U.S. GAAP is the basis for the preparation
of Sellers consolidated financial statements and related footnotes which are
presented in Sellers annual report on SEC Form 10-K for the 2008 and 2009
periods. The Financial Statements reflect (i) all Acquired Assets and no
assets other than the Acquired Assets and (ii) no Liabilities other than the
Assumed Liabilities; provided that the amount of such assets and liabilities
are subject to change in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice between the date of such Financial Statements and the Closing Date.
_Schedule 4.04(a)_ also contains a reasonably detailed description of all
adjustments that were made to the Sellers internal business financial
statements when preparing the Financial Statements. Such descriptions
shall include the amount of each such adjustment for each of the 2010, 2009
and 2008 fiscal years. All such adjustments were deemed reasonable by Seller
in preparing the Financial Statements for the business to be sold. The
Financial Statements and the information used by Seller to calculate the
Target Net Working Capital both includes all BV Inventory as of such dates.

(b) The Business does not have any Liabilities (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, unasserted or otherwise) of a nature required by the Accounting
Principles to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Business or
in the notes thereto, except (i) as disclosed, reflected or reserved against
in the Financial Statements and the notes thereto, (ii) for items set forth in
_Schedule 4.04(b)_ and (iii) for Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
of the Business consistent with past practice since the date of the Financial
Statements.

(c) Since January 1, 2010, the Business has been conducted in the ordinary
course of the Business, and there has not been any events, changes,
developments, circumstances or occurrences that has resulted in, or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on _Schedule
4.04(c)_ , since January 1, 2010, the Seller has not with respect to the
Business:

(i) sold, leased to, transferred or assigned any assets or property (tangible
or intangible) with a value in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate other than
sales of inventory in the ordinary course of the Business;

 



-29-  (ii) experienced any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by
insurance) to its assets or property (tangible or intangible) in excess of
$250,000 in the aggregate other than damage, destruction or loss repaired or
replaced in the ordinary course of the Business (including, without
limitation, routine maintenance and scheduled plant/unit turnarounds);

any of the foregoing with respect to any Contract listed on _Schedule 4.08_

_Schedule 4.08_ ) that if in effect on the date hereof would be required to be
listed on  _Schedule 4.08_ ;

(iv) granted any increase in excess of five percent (5%) in salary or target
bonus amount, made any change to bonus methodology, or otherwise increased
the compensation or benefits payable or provided to any Business Employee
whose base salary is in excess of $100,000;

(v) instituted any material change in the conduct of its business or any
material change in its accounting practices or methods, cash management
practices or method of purchase, sale, lease, management, marketing, or
operation;

(vi) taken or omitted to take any action which has had or could be reasonably
anticipated to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect;

(vii) engaged in any material promotional, sales or discount or other activity
outside of the ordinary course of the Business that has or could reasonably
be expected to have the effect of accelerating sales prior to the Closing that
would otherwise be expected to occur subsequent to the Closing, including any
changes in sales activity between the Business and Seller or its Affiliates;

(viii) made any commitment in excess of $500,000 for any capital expenditures
to be paid after the Closing or failed to incur more than $500,000 of capital
expenditures (in the aggregate) that were provided for its capital expense
budget;

(ix) cancelled or waived any material claims or material rights of substantial
value to the Business, other than in the ordinary course of the Business;

presently being used, and are adequate for the purposes for which they are

suppliers shall be at a time reasonably acceptable to Seller.

(b) If Seller becomes aware prior to Closing of any event, fact or condition
or nonoccurrence of any event, fact or condition that may constitute a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller or may
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller if such
representation or warranty were made on the date of the occurrence or
discovery of such event, fact or condition or on the Closing Date, then
Seller will promptly provide Purchaser with a written description of such
event, fact or condition. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
Seller shall have the continuing obligation to promptly supplement the
information contained in the Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter
arising or discovered, which, if in existence on the date hereof and known at
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Schedules. Neither the supplementation of any Schedule
pursuant to the obligation in this Section 6.03 nor any other disclosure after
the date hereof of the untruth of any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement shall operate as a cure of the failure to disclose the information,
or a cure of the breach of any representation or warranty made herein or
affect Purchasers right to refuse to complete the Closing pursuant to Section
7.02(a); and determination of any liability for breach of representations or
warranties either at signing or at Closing shall be made without reference to
any supplements and with reference only to the Schedule as it stands on the
date of this Agreement.

of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller is, on the
advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any

or policies of Purchaser established for or made available to the Acquired

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Acquired Employee who, prior to the
Closing Date has attained (x) the age of fifty-five (55) and has completed at

(g) Purchaser shall assume and discharge the obligations of Seller and its

be reflected as a liability in the calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital). Seller shall furnish to Purchaser, within three Business Days
following the Closing, information as to the accrued vacation pay, if any, of
each Acquired Employee as of the Closing Date. If an Acquired Employees
employment with Purchaser is terminated, any remaining such accrued and unused
vacation pay shall be paid by Purchaser to such Acquired Employee as provided
under the terms of applicable law and the applicable vacation policy. For
purposes of determining vacation pay of Acquired Employees under Purchasers
vacation policy in which they become participants, Acquired Employees shall be
credited for service with Seller and/or its Affiliates (including service
with previous employers which is credited by Seller and/or its Affiliates) to
the extent such service was recognized for purposes of the corresponding
vacation policies of Seller and/or its Affiliates.

 

(h) Purchaser shall permit Acquired Employees to enroll in its plans or
programs providing life insurance, and long term and short term disability

entitled to receive such benefits under such Seller Benefit Plan in accordance
with its terms after the Closing Date and shall not become an Acquired
Employee unless such individual returns to service within 12 months after the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall not assume any Liabilities for providing such
long-term disability benefits to such individual. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any individual who has, as of the Closing Date, met
the conditions to receive short-term disability benefits under any Seller

benefits under such Seller Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms
after the Closing Date and shall not become an Acquired Employee unless such

provided further that any individual who has, as of the Closing Date, met the
conditions to receive short-term disability benefits under any Seller Benefit
Plan as of the Closing Date shall be entitled to receive long-term disability
benefits under any Seller Employee Plan if such individual later meets the
eligibility requirements under such plans. Except for the reimbursement of
Seller described in paragraph (a) of this Subsection 6.09, Purchaser shall not
assume any Liabilities for providing such short-term disability benefits or
long-term disability benefits to such individuals.

Employees as 100% vested in all benefits (other than eligibility for any early
retirement provisions, which are addressed above) under such Seller Pension
Plans as of the Closing Date.

(l) Nothing herein shall be deemed to create any right to employment
or continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment
with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 6.09 or any
other provision of this Agreement (i) shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) shall limit the ability of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them.

(m) Seller shall pay the 2010 bonuses under Sellers bonus plans to the
Acquired Employees at the same time other employees of Seller receive their
bonus payments and Seller shall determine the amounts of such bonuses in the
same manner as other Seller employees. Seller shall pay to Purchaser an
amount equal to the amount (estimated at between $300,000 and $350,000) that
Seller would have paid to the Sellers defined contribution plan in profit
sharing, matching contributions and transition credits with respect to 2010
bonus payments for the Acquired Employees (the " _Matching Contributions_ ")

balances of the Acquired Employees under Seller Defined Contribution Plans, in
the form of cash, Seller common stock and promissory notes evidencing
outstanding loans made to the Acquired Employees. The Purchaser
Defined Contribution Plan(s) shall be substituted as the obligee of such
promissory notes, and, except as permitted by law, no other changes shall be
made with respect to the terms of the notes. The Purchaser and the Seller
shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to take, or cause their defined
contribution plan(s) to take, any actions that are necessary to effect such
transfer

 



-47-   and to ensure that any such transfer conforms to the applicable requirements

the Closing, each party shall grant to the other party and its representatives

make those Acquired Employees, who have information regarding such litigation
or threatened litigation, available to Seller at a reasonable time and place.

submittal, it shall be commercially reasonable for Seller to promptly follow-
up with LDEQ or the other Governmental Entities, in writing, and thereafter
periodically until receipt of the substantive response; and 

(v) in the case of any activities undertaken pursuant to Section 6.20, Seller
shall be deemed to have failed to use commercially reasonable efforts if the
Seller unreasonably, or with an intent to delay, objects to, appeals,
challenges or otherwise contests the findings, conclusions or other
determinations of any Governmental Entity related to such activities. 

(c) _Access and Information_. Upon at least three (3) days prior written
notice, Purchaser agrees to provide Seller reasonable access to the Owned
Real Property as is required for Seller to satisfy its obligations with
respect to the Retained Environmental Liabilities as described above in
Section 6.20(a), and Purchaser will permit Purchasers employees to provide
reasonable levels of support and to cooperate with Seller (including without
limitation, the provision of information reasonably available to Purchaser) as
is necessary for Seller to satisfy such obligations. All actions taken by
Seller pursuant to this Section 6.20 (i) shall not unreasonably interfere
with the operation of the Business and (ii) shall be completed in a

 



-52-   commercially reasonable manner and in accordance with Applicable Law,
including Environmental Laws and Health and Safety Laws. Seller will (A)
reimburse Purchaser for any costs incurred by Purchaser in providing support
or cooperation to Seller, (B) keep Purchaser informed as to Sellers
activities pursuant to this Section 6.20 and the status of, and any
development related to, all of the Retained Environmental Liabilities and the
activities required to be undertaken by Purchaser pursuant to this Section
6.20, (C) promptly provide Purchaser with copies of any correspondence or
other documents provided to or received from any Governmental Entity related
to such matters), (D) indemnify, defend and hold the Purchaser Indemnitees
harmless from and against any and all Liabilities and Losses to the extent
arising, in whole or part, out the performance by Seller, its employees,
agents, independent contractors, sub-contractors or Persons acting on their
behalf, of any of the actions described above, and (E) give Purchaser notice
of any proposed meeting with any Government Entity at least 5 Business Days
prior to such meeting and permit Purchaser and its advisors to attend and
observe such meeting but not actively participate in any such meeting.

 

(d) _Purchaser s Right to Cure_. If Seller materially breaches this Section
6.20, then after (i) due inquiry by Purchaser, (ii) Purchaser discussing its
concerns with Seller, and (iii) following such discussion, Purchaser providing
Seller with written notice of its failure to satisfy its obligations under
this Section 6.20 and providing Seller thirty (30) days to cure its breach,
Purchaser may, at Sellers cost and expense, take any and all actions
necessary to resolve the matters described in Section 6.20(a)(i) through (v)
above.

 

(e) _Control of Certain Activities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement:

 

(i) With respect to Item 2 of _Schedule 2.03(b)(vii)_ , Purchaser and Seller
shall cooperate in good faith with respect to, and jointly control, all of
the actions to be taken pursuant to Section 6.20(a). The costs and expenses of
Remediation and Cleanup for such actions shall be borne 80% by Sellers and 20%
by Purchaser. All other Retained Environmental Liabilities with respect to
Item 2 of _Schedule 2.03(b)(vii)_ shall be borne by Seller; and

(ii) With respect to Items 15 and 16 of _Schedule 2.03(b)(vii)_ , Purchaser
and Seller shall cooperate in good faith with respect to, and jointly control,
all of the actions to be taken pursuant to Section 6.20(a). The costs and
expenses of all such actions taken pursuant to Section 6.20(a) shall be borne
50% by Sellers and 50% by Purchaser up to $2,000,000 in the aggregate, and
Sellers shall bear 100% of all such costs and expenses in excess of
$2,000,000. All other Retained Environmental Liabilities with respect to
Items 15 or 16 of _Schedule 2.03(b)(vii)_ shall be borne by Seller.

(iii) Following the first anniversary of the Reduction Date, upon prior
written notice to Seller, Purchaser shall have the sole right to control and
effect any actions required to be taken pursuant to Section 6.20(a) that have
not been completed or otherwise satisfied prior to the Reduction Date, and
Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification for all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of it in connection with such actions in
accordance with Section 9.01(d).

 

SECTION 6.21. _Other Sellers_. Seller will take all actions necessary to
ensure that (a) the representations and warranties of the Seller Transferors
are true and correct, (b) the Seller Transferors comply with all of the terms

3 on  _Schedule 4.25_. With respect to item number 1 on _Schedule 4.25_ ,
Sellers obligation to provide such financial assurance shall expire three
years after the Closing. If Applicable Law requires that either of these
financial assurances be provided by Purchaser, rather than Seller, then if
Purchaser satisfies such financial assurances requirements by having a letter
of credit issued to the appropriate Governmental Entity then so long as
Purchasers letter of credit is outstanding (subject in the case of item 1 on
_Schedule 4.25_ to the 3 year limitation described above) the Seller will
cause a commercial bank with a credit rating of at least A2 by Moodys and A
by Standard and Poors to issue a back to back irrevocable standby letter of
credit in the same amount to the bank that issued the letter of credit on
Purchasers behalf.

SECTION 6.23. _Access to Seller Insurance_. To the extent that the Purchaser
or the Business suffer or incur any Losses or Liabilities (a " _Loss Event_ ")
by reason of, or arising out of, any action, inaction, event, condition,
liability or obligation of the Seller, any of its predecessors or assigns, or
the Business which occurred or existed prior to the Closing, or by reason of
or in connection with any claim or cause of action of any third party
relating to the conduct of the Business prior to Closing, then upon receipt of
notice from any of the Purchaser Indemnitees of such Loss Event, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly (i) use all reasonable efforts to
submit claims for such matters under any of its (or any of its Affiliates)
applicable insurance policies on behalf of the Purchaser or the Business in
connection with such Loss Event in a manner that is consistent with the terms
of such policies (including, without limitation, using all reasonable efforts
to pursue any claims denied under such applicable insurance policies) and (ii)
pay to the Purchaser Indemnitees for any proceeds actually received by Seller
(or any of its Affiliates) under any of its applicable insurance policies in
connection with such Loss Event. Any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Seller in pursuing any claims denied under the applicable policies
shall promptly be reimbursed by the Purchaser.

SECTION 6.24. _Access to Purchaser Insurance_. To the extent that Seller is
required to indemnify Purchaser for a Hearing Loss Claim or an Asbestos Claim
by reason of, or arising out of, any action, event, or condition which
occurred or existed after the Closing (a " _Seller Loss Event_ "), then upon
receipt of notice from Seller of such Seller Loss Event, Purchaser shall
promptly (i) use all reasonable efforts to submit claims for such matters
under its Workers Compensation insurance policies on behalf of the Seller in
connection with such Seller Loss Event in a manner that is consistent with
the terms of such policy (including, without limitation, using all reasonable
efforts to pursue any claims denied under such insurance policy) and (ii)
either pay the Seller or reduce the Purchasers indemnity claim for
any proceeds actually received by Purchaser under such insurance policy in
connection with such Seller Loss Event. Any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Purchaser in pursuing any claims denied under the applicable
policies shall promptly be reimbursed by the Seller.

 



-54-  SECTION 6.25. _REACH Membership_. Upon the written request of Purchaser,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute and deliver, all
such documents and instruments, and take all such further or other actions, as
reasonably necessary or desirable to assign and transfer onto Purchaser (or
its designee) its membership in the melamine REACH consortium and its
membership in the acrylonitrile REACH consortium and the related registrations
with any Governmental Entity.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _Indemnification_

SECTION 9.01. _Indemnification by Seller_.

 



-58-  (a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ")
against, and hold them harmless from, any Losses to the extent arising from:

 



     | (i) | any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement or in any Transaction Document to which Seller is
a party; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | any breach of any covenant of Seller contained in this
Agreement or in any Transaction Document to which Seller is a party; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | any Excluded Liability; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by
Seller to any brokers, financial advisors or comparable other Persons retained
or employed by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

(b) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person, and shall not have
any liability:



     | (i) | under clause (i) of Section 9.01(a) unless the aggregate of
all Losses for which Seller would, but for this clause (b)(i), be liable
exceeds on a cumulative basis $3,000,000, after which point Seller will be
obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees from and against all Losses
from dollar one; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | under clause (i) of Section 9.01(a) for any breach of a
representation and warranty if the claim arising from such breach (together
with any related claims which arise out of substantially similar or the same
facts and circumstances) exceeds $25,000, in which case Seller shall be liable
for the full amount thereof (subject to the limitations provided in this
Article 9); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | under clause (i) of Section 9.01(a) for Losses in excess
of $43,750,000. 
---|---|--- 

_provided_ , that the foregoing limitations provided in this Section 9.01(b)
shall not apply in respect of any Losses relating to (i) breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.05(a), and
4.06(a), or (ii) any intentional or fraudulent breach of a representation or
warranty.

(c) Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover under this Section 9.01 an
amount in respect of Losses or otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution
more than once in respect of the same Losses. In addition, Purchaser shall
not be entitled to recover under this

 



-59-   Section 9.01 any Losses arising out of a breach of any representation or
warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement to the extent such Losses also
constitute an Assumed Environmental Liability.

(d) Seller agrees to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees for all Retained
Environmental Liabilities that are incurred or that arise at any time prior
to the five (5) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Reduction Date_
"). Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees for (i) 75% of all
Retained Environmental Liabilities that are incurred or that first arise
during the period beginning immediately following the fifth (5th) anniversary
of the Closing Date up to and including the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Closing Date; (ii) 50% of all Retained Environmental Liabilities that are
incurred or that first arise during the period beginning immediately following
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date up to and including the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date; and (iii) 25% of all Retained
Environmental Liabilities that are incurred or that first arise following the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date and up to an including the
eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date. The Retained Environmental
Liabilities are subject to assumption by Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.03(a)(vii).

(e) Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover any Losses under this Section
9.01 related to the Retained Environmental Liabilities to the extent that
those Losses result from any voluntary soil, surface water, sediment or
groundwater investigation undertaken by the Purchaser. For the avoidance of
doubt, a soil, surface water, sediment or groundwater investigation is not
voluntary if: (i) ordered, demanded or requested by Governmental Authorities;
(ii) required by Environmental Laws; (iii) requested by a bona fide lender
that has a commercially reasonable concern with respect to Environmental
Conditions on the Business Property; (iv) requested by any bona fide
prospective purchaser of the Business or the Business Property; (v)
reasonably undertaken or discovered in the course of construction or building
projects, which did not have a soil, surface water, sediment or groundwater
investigation as part of the purpose; a reasonably prudent property
owner would conclude that there is a potential material threat to the
environment or the health and safety of employees, occupants of the Business
Property or persons downgradient of the Business Property, and (vi) there is
an Environmental Condition that if left unsatisfied or uninvestigated would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Environmental Claim that is not a
Retained Environmental Liability.

(f) Purchaser acknowledges that its sole and exclusive monetary remedy after
the Closing with respect to any and all claims under this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the Business and its assets and Liabilities
(other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX
and Section 2.04. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser hereby waives,
from and after the Closing, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) for
monetary damages it may have against Seller arising under or based upon any
Applicable Law (including any relating to environmental matters) or arising
under or based upon common law or otherwise (except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 9.01). NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) NEITHER PARTY WILL
BE

 



-60-   LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR: (A) ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES THAT ARISE AFTER THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE OR THAT
ARE NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE; OR (B) ANY PUNITIVE, SPECULATIVE OR SPECIAL
DAMAGES (EXCEPT, IN EACH CASE, THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT
SUCH DAMAGES ARE PAYABLE TO A THIRD PARTY) AND (2) PURCHASER SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL AND INDIRECT DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT
SELLER CAN ESTABLISH SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM CHANGES IN THE GENERAL BUSINESS
CHARACTERISTICS OR AN INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESS, IN EITHER CASE
THAT OCCUR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.

 

(g) The right to indemnification, payment of any Losses or other remedy based
on such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, (including, without
limitation, any knowledge acquired as a result of any supplement or update
to the Schedules made by Seller) whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant, or obligation. 

(h) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under Section
9.01(a)(i) for a breach by Seller of a representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement to the extent Seller has established that either Rick Rosen,
Keval Patel or Matthew Gullen (the " _Purchaser Knowledge Group_ ") (i) had
actual knowledge (without a duty of inquiry) prior to the date of this
Agreement of the facts which constituted such breach, and (ii) had actual
knowledge, as of that date, that such facts constituted a breach of such
representation or warranty, and knowingly failed to disclose the knowledge of
such breach to the Seller, in each case prior to the date of this Agreement.
If Seller seeks to avoid its indemnification obligation pursuant to this
Section 9.01(h), then Seller shall have the burden of proving that
the requirements set forth in this Section 9.01(h) have been satisfied.
Reference to any fact, circumstance, condition or issue in any third party
report prepared for Purchaser or in any document Made Available to Purchaser
shall not be, in each case, in and of itself, sufficient to prove that the
requirements set forth in this Section 9.01(h) have been satisfied.
Furthermore, the Purchaser Knowledge Group shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of, and this Section 9.01(h) shall not apply to, any claim for
breach of representation or warranty related to any fact, circumstance,
condition or issue identified in or arising from any further actions or
investigations or as a result of any Identified Environmental Matters. 

SECTION 9.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller, its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives against, and agrees to hold them
harmless from, any Loss, as incurred (payable promptly upon written request),
for or on account of or arising from or in connection with or otherwise with
respect to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any Transaction Document to which
Purchaser is a party, (ii) any breach of any covenant of Purchaser contained
in this Agreement or in any Transaction Document to 

 



-61-   which Purchaser is a party, (iii) any Assumed Liability or (iv) any fees,
expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Purchaser to any brokers,
financial advisors or other comparable Persons retained or employed by it in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any
Transaction Document.

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller against, and
agrees to hold Seller harmless from, any Loss incurred by Seller (payable
promptly upon written request) as a result of any Third Party Claim against
Seller that arises exclusively from the Purchasers operation of the Acquired
Assets after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser will
not be required to indemnify Seller against, or hold Seller harmless from,
any such Loss or claim that constitutes, or arises from, (i) a breach by
Seller or its Affiliates of any of Sellers or its Affiliates representation,
warranty or covenant, (ii) an Excluded Liability or any other obligation of
Seller or its Affiliates under this Agreement or any other agreement executed
in connection herewith, (iii) actions taken by Seller or its Affiliates, or
(iv) the operation of the Business prior to Closing. Purchaser shall have the
right to assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section
9.05(b) and shall not be required to satisfy the conditions described in
clauses (ii), (iii), or (iv) of Section 9.05(b) as a condition to such
assumption.

SECTION 9.03. _Calculation of Losses_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be net of any amounts recovered by the indemnified party
under insurance policies with respect to such Loss. For purposes of
determining the amount of Losses resulting from any misrepresentation or
breach of a representation or warranty, all qualifications or exceptions in
any representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms
"material", "materiality", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded, it being the
understanding of the Parties that for purposes of determining liability under
this Article IX, the representations and warranties of the Parties contained
in this Agreement shall be read as if such terms and phrases were not included
in them. 

(b) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be reduced by the amount of any proceeds actually received
by Purchaser under the Environmental Insurance Policies or other applicable
insurance policy (the " _Policies_ "), net of any costs or expenses incurred
by Purchaser in collecting such amount. Purchaser will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to recover under the Policies for any Losses covered by the
Policies prior to Seller being required to indemnify Purchaser for such
Losses. If Purchaser receives any insurance proceeds after the Seller
has paid the Purchaser in respect of any Loss, the Purchaser must notify the
Seller and pay to the Seller the amount of such recovery (in an amount not to
exceed the indemnification previously received by Purchaser and less the
Purchasers reasonable costs of receiving such recovery or benefit) within
five days after the recovery has been received.

SECTION 9.04.  _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless any party, (i) pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(i) or 9.02(i),
shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates
pursuant to Section 9.06 and (ii) pursuant to the other clauses of Sections
9.01 and 9.02 shall not terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that such

 



-62-   obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect
to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim)
pursuant to Section 9.05 to the party to be providing the indemnification.

 

SECTION 9.05. _Procedures_.

(a) In order for a party (the " _indemnified party_ "), to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim made by any Person against the indemnified party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying
party in writing (and in reasonable detail) of the Third Party Claim within 10
Business Days after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of
the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the indemnifying party
shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the
indemnified party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the indemnified
party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five Business Days time
after the indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating
to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party; _provided_ , that (i) the indemnifying party notifies
the indemnified party in writing within 15 days after the indemnified party
has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party will
indemnify the indemnified party from and against the entirety of any Losses
the indemnified party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to,
in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim, (ii) the indemnifying
party provides the indemnified party with evidence reasonably acceptable to
the indemnified party that the indemnifying party will have the financial
resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii) the Third Party Claim involves
only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable
relief, (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third
Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the indemnified party,
likely to establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the
continuing business interests or the reputation of the indemnified party, and
(v) the indemnifying party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying
party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense (so long as
it is actively and diligently doing so). The indemnifying party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party
for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the indemnified party shall
have failed to

 



-63-   give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the indemnifying
party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the indemnified
parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys
request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified
party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend that involves
solely money damages (and not any injunctive or other relief) and that by its
terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability
in connection with such Third Party Claim and which releases the indemnified
party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim. 

(c) _Other Claims_. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 9.01 or 9.02, as the case may
be, that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought
to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall
deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying
party. The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may
have to such indemnified party under Section 9.01 or 9.02, as the case may
be, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party does not
notify the indemnified party within 30 calendar days following its receipt of
such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the
indemnified party under Section 9.01 or 9.02, as the case may be, such claim
specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
a liability of the indemnifying party under Section 9.01 or 9.02, as the case
may be, and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to
the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the
amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date
when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally
determined. If the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability with
respect to such claim, as provided above, the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) _Mitigation_. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with
respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party
is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making
commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or
liability. In the event that the board of directors, chief executive officer
(or functional equivalent, if there is no chief executive officer), chief
operating officer (or functional equivalent, if there is no chief operating
officer) or chief financial officer (or functional equivalent, if there is
no chief financial officer) of a Party shall have knowledge that such Party
is entitled to indemnification from the other party pursuant to this Agreement
for

 



-64-   a particular matter such Party will use commercially reasonable efforts in
the ordinary course of business to mitigate any Losses it may suffer with
respect to such matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of
Purchaser to use such efforts to mitigate shall not constitute a defense to,
or in any way otherwise relieve the Seller of, the Sellers obligations to
indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to this Agreement but may be
asserted by Seller as a basis for seeking to reduce the amount of the
indemnity.

SECTION 9.06. _Survival of Representations_. The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in any document
delivered in connection herewith shall survive the Closing and such
representations and warranties shall terminate (i) upon the running of the
statute of limitations (without regard to any toll thereof agreed to by
Purchaser) with respect to Sections 4.07 (Intellectual Property) and 4.14
(Taxes); (ii) seventy eight (78) months following the Closing Date with
respect to Sections 4.11(a), (d), (e), (h), (j) and (k); (iii) thirty six (36)

4.18(e); (iv) twenty four (24) months following the Closing Date with respect
to Sections 4.11(b), (c), (f) and (i); and (v) with respect to all other
representations and warranties except for Sections 4.7 (Intellectual
Property), 4.11 (Environmental Disclosure), 4.14 (Taxes) and 4.18(e), on
April 30, 2012; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.01, 4.02, 4.05(a) and 4.06(a) shall not
terminate and shall continue indefinitely. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
claim related to an intentional or fraudulent breach of a representation or
warrant may be made at any time without limitation.

 

SECTION 9.07. _No Additional Representations_. Purchaser acknowledges that
neither Seller nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Business furnished or Made Available to Purchaser and its
representatives, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents or the Schedules, and, except in the case of fraud,
neither Seller nor any other Person shall have or be subject to any liability
to Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser,
or Purchasers use of, any such information and any information, documents or
material Made Available to Purchaser in any "data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

SECTION 9.08. _Release of American Cyanamid_. Purchaser hereby agrees not to,
and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates not to, make any claim for Losses
against American Cyanamid Company and its subsidiaries and their respective
successors and assigns (other than Seller), known or unknown, (i) relating to
or arising out of the operations of the Business as conducted at any time
prior to the Closing (other than matters arising in the ordinary course of
business) and (ii) relating to or arising out of conditions of any asset of
the Business. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and
its Affiliates harmless from and against any Losses arising from a claim
brought by Purchaser or its Affiliates in violation of this Section 9.08.

SECTION 9.09. _Indemnification for Hearing Loss Cases and Asbestos Claims_.
With respect to the Hearing Loss Cases and Asbestos Claims, the parties shall
have the following liabilities and obligations and shall be entitled to
indemnification as follows:

 



-65-  (a) With respect to any Hearing Loss Cases or Asbestos Claim filed or
otherwise asserted against either Party of any of its Affiliates on or prior
to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, including, but not limited
to those filed or asserted prior to the Closing (the " _First Exposure Claims
Period_ "), Seller shall (i) at its cost, assume the defense of and defend
and pay, such claim and (ii) indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees against, and
hold them harmless from, any Losses incurred or suffered by any Purchaser
Indemnitee to the extent arising from such claims; _provided_ , if Seller can
establish that such claim arises solely as a result of exposure to noise or
asbestos from the Business exclusively following the Closing (an " _Post-
Closing Exposure Claim_ "), then Purchaser shall (x) at its cost, assume the
defense of and defend and pay, such Post-Closing Exposure Claim and (y)
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against, and hold them harmless from, of any
Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising

Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees against, and hold them
harmless from, any Losses incurred or suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee to

for fifty percent (50%) of any amounts paid in settlement or judgments
rendered in connection with such claims; _provided_ ,

its cost, assume the defense of and defend and pay, such Pre-Closing Exposure
Claim and (y) indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees against, and hold them
