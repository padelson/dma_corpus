Dispute Letter, the issues in dispute will be submitted by Buyers and Sellers
to an independent certified public accounting firm of the United States,

Closing Date, and the two firms so selected shall mutually agree upon a third
independent certified public accounting firm of the United States, which

preceding the Closing Date, which third firm shall serve as the Accountants.
The Accountants shall consider only those items and amounts that were
identified in the Dispute Letter that Sellers and Buyers have not resolved
during such fifteen (15) day period. The Accountants' determination shall be
based solely on the Accounting Procedures, the definitions of Cash,
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses contained herein
and the provisions of this Agreement, including this Section 2.2(c). Each
party will furnish to the Accountants such paperwork and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Accountants may
request and are available to that party (or its independent public
accountants), and will be afforded the opportunity to present to
the Accountants any materials relating to the determination and to discuss
the determination with the Accountants. The Accountants' determination shall
not introduce any new or different accounting methods, policies, practices,
procedures, classifications, judgments or estimation methodologies from those
utilized in preparing the Closing Statement. Further, the Accountants'
determination shall be based solely on the presentations by Buyers and
Sellers that are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in
this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). In no event
shall the Accountants' determination of the unresolved disputed items be for
an amount outside the range of Buyers' determination thereof in the Closing
Statement or Sellers' determination thereof in the Dispute Letter. The
Accountants' final determination of shall be made within thirty (30) days of
their engagement, which determination shall be set forth in a written notice
delivered to all parties by the Accountants and shall be conclusive, binding
on and non-appealable by the parties. The cost and expenses of the
Accountants\' services shall be borne one half by Buyers and one half by
Sellers.

Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price, the Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement shall promptly pay such difference to Buyers out of the
Escrow Funds by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one (1) or
more accounts designated by Buyers. If the Final Closing Date Purchase Price
is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price, Buyers shall pay
the difference to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
one (1) or more accounts designated by Sellers in accordance with the Seller
Allocations. Payment shall be made within 14 days after the earlier of the
final determination by the parties, or the Accountants\' delivery of its
written report.

  



  

(e) Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes required by applicable Law to
be deducted or withheld from such payment and (b) any amounts deducted or
withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to the applicable taxing
authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid. If the Buyers determine that such withholding of any such Tax is
required by applicable Law, the Buyers will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide notice of the expected withholding at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date of withholding to the Person with respect to
which the withholding is to be made (and the notice will include the legal
authority and the calculation method for the expected withholding), and the
parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to

(e) Each of the Employee Benefit Plans is in compliance in all
material respects with its terms and all applicable Legal Requirements,
including, without limitation, the currently applicable provisions of ERISA
and the Code. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension
benefit plan" within the meaning of section 3(2) of ERISA and which is
intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and the

severance pay or any other payment, (ii) result in any payment becoming due,
accelerate the time of payment or vesting of benefits, or increase the amount

of indebtedness, trigger any funding obligation under any Employee Benefit
Plan or impose any restrictions or limitations on the Acquired Companies'
rights to administer, amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan, or (iv)
result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property)
to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation section 1.280G-1) that could reasonably be construed,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, to constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-
up or other payment) from any Acquired Company as a result of the imposition
of the excise taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any taxes imposed

written communication alleging any Infringement relating to any Intellectual
Property. No notice, claim, suit, action, proceeding, offer to license in
lieu of further action, demand or cease and desist letter is pending, or to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Acquired Company for
Infringement or any other claim or proceeding relating to any Intellectual

their rights in and to such Intellectual Property Asset, or an Acquired
Company owns such Intellectual Property Asset pursuant to applicable law.

  



  

(d) Each Acquired Company has taken all commercially reasonable
actions to protect the Intellectual Property Assets (including making
and maintaining in full force and effect all necessary filings,
registrations, and issuances) and all precautions to protect the
secrecy, confidentiality and value of its Trade Secrets. To the knowledge of
the Company, no Acquired Company is using any Intellectual Property Asset
that is material to the business of the Acquired Companies in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to result in the cancellation or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property Asset. The Trade Secrets owned
by the Acquired Companies are not part of the public knowledge or literature
and to the Company\'s knowledge, have not been used, divulged or
appropriated either for the benefit of any Person (other than one or more of
the Acquired Companies) or to the detriment of the Acquired Companies.

record books and other records of the Acquired Companies, all of which have
been made available to Buyers, are complete and correct in all respects and
have been maintained in accordance with sound business practices. The books
of the Acquired Companies contain accurate and complete records in all
material respects of all meetings held of, and actions taken by, the Acquired
Companies. At the Closing, all of those books and records will be in the

of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with past practice, except for
obsolete items and items of below-standard quality, all of which have been
written off or written down to net realizable value in the Year-End Balance
Sheet or the Interim Financial Statements or on the accounting records of the
Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date, as the case may be and in

(iii) any Law or Order to which Buyers may be subject; or

  



  

(iv) any material contract or agreement to which Buyers are a party or
by which Buyers may be bound.

Buyers are not and will not be required to obtain any Consent from any Person
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation or performance of any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and under the HSR Act.

  



  

5.3 Certain Proceedings. There is no pending Action that has been
commenced against Buyers that challenges, or may have the effect of
preventing, delaying, making illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To Buyers\' knowledge, no
such Action has been threatened.

  



  

5.4 Financing.  Buyers have delivered to Sellers true, complete and
correct copies of an executed Debt Commitment Letter. The Debt Commitment
Letter has not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement (
_provided_ that the existence or exercise of the "flex" provisions contained
in the Debt Fee Letter (as defined below) shall not constitute an amendment
of or modification to the Debt Commitment Letter), and, as of the date hereof,
to the knowledge of Buyers, the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, reduced or rescinded in any
respect. Except for any fee letter relating to fees and expenses with respect
to the Debt Financing (the "Debt Fee Letter"), as of the date hereof, there
are no side letters or other contracts or arrangements related to the funding
of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter delivered to Sellers pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 5.4. Buyers have fully paid or caused to be fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees or expenses that are required to be paid on or
prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, and, as of
the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter, as delivered to Sellers pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 5.4, is in full force and effect and is
the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyers and, to the knowledge of
Buyers, each of the lender parties thereto, as the case may be, subject to
the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law). Other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter or as set forth in any
such documents amended after the date hereof and not in violation of the
provisions hereof, there are no conditions precedent related to the funding
of the full net amount of the Debt Financing (including any "flex" provisions)
under any agreement relating to the Debt Financing to which Buyers are a
party that would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) impair the validity
of the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing or (iii) materially delay or prevent the Closing. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyers or, to the knowledge of
Buyers, any other party under the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III and
Article IV and performance by Sellers and the Company of their respective
obligations hereunder, upon receipt of the proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, Buyers will have access at the Closing to sufficient funds
to (i) pay the Purchase Price, and (ii) pay all other amounts contemplated by
this Agreement to be paid by it and to perform its obligations hereunder.

  



  

5.5 Sufficient Cash. Buyers currently have, and at all times
hereafter until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement will have, sufficient cash on hand to pay the Reverse Termination
Fee.

successor to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated January 11, 1993
among A.K. Steel, as successor in interest to ARMCO Inc., E.G. Smith
Construction Products, Inc. and S and S Acquisition Corp. (the "AK Steel
Agreement"). Pursuant to Section 20.3 of the AK Steel Agreement, the Company
is entitled to certain protections, including indemnification, relating to
environmental matters at the Company's Cambridge facility, subject to the
condition that the Company adhere to all of the Company's obligations and
restrictions as set forth therein (the "Cambridge Obligations"). Buyers agree
(i) to cause the Company to adhere to and to be bound by the Cambridge
Obligations from and after Closing, and (ii) that in the event Buyers and/or
the Company incur any losses that are subject to indemnification under the AK
Steel Agreement, Buyers will, and will cause the Company to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue such indemnification under the terms of the AK
Steel Agreement. In the event Buyers fail to comply with the terms of this
Section 7.4, any indemnification obligations of the Sellers that would
otherwise apply under Article XI of this Agreement shall not apply to the
extent that the Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties would have
been subject to the indemnification obligations of AK Steel under the AK Steel
Agreement, had Buyers complied with their obligations hereunder, _provided,
that_ , reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs incurred by Buyers or the
Company pursuant to Section 7.4(ii) to pursue such indemnification under the
terms of the AK Steel Agreement but that are not recoverable or recovered in
connection with such pursuit ("Unrecovered Environmental Indemnity
Costs") shall constitute "Damages" for purposes of indemnification under
Section 11.2 hereof.

  



  

7.5 Certain Compensation Matters. Notwithstanding the terms of
Section 6.3, Buyers consent to the payment by the Acquired Companies prior to
Closing of employee profit sharing, incentive, year-end and other bonus
payments consistent with past practice. If not paid prior to the Closing, to
the extent such bonus amounts are accrued and accounted for in determining
Net Working Capital, then Buyers agree to cause the Acquired Companies to pay
such bonuses after Closing in accordance with Sellers' prior written
instructions no later than March 15, 2015.

10.2 Effect of Termination.

  



  

(a) Except as provided in Section 10.2, each party\'s right of
termination under Section 10.1 is in addition to any other rights it may
have under this Agreement or otherwise and the exercise of a right of
termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void and all
further obligations of the parties (or any of its directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, Affiliates, agents, representatives or advisors) to
the other parties hereto under this Agreement will terminate, except as
provided in Section 10.2 and Article I and Article XIII hereof, which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. Except as set forth herein and
subject to the terms hereof, the termination of this Agreement shall be the
exclusive remedy of the parties hereto for any breach of another party of its
representations and warranties, except to the extent any such breach was
willful or intentional.

  



  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.1(f), then Buyers shall pay or caused to be
paid to Sellers a fee in the amount of Seventeen Million Eight Hundred Fifty

wire transfer of immediately available funds (it being understood that in no
event shall Buyers be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more
than one occasion) to an account designated by Sellers, _provided_ , 
_however_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
Buyers shall not be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee, if the Debt
Financing was not available as a result of a breach of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.4(c) (subject to the
disclosures set forth in _Schedule 3.4_). The Reverse Termination Fee
shall be paid no later than five Business Days after notice of termination of
this Agreement as provided in this Section 10.2. Buyers acknowledge and agree
that the agreements contained in this Section 10.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Sellers would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto further acknowledges that the payment by Buyers of the Reverse
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but constitutes liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Sellers in the circumstances in which
such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. Further, the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee in the
circumstances specified herein is supported by due and sufficient
consideration.

11.5 Limitations on Indemnification.

  



  

(a) Sellers will have no liability (for indemnification or
otherwise) with respect to matters described in Section 11.2(a) (excluding
claims for indemnification asserting breaches by the Company or Sellers of
any Fundamental Representations) or Section11.2(e) and Buyers will have no
liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to matters described
in Section 11.3(a), as the case may be, unless and until the aggregate amount
of Damages that would be payable by Sellers hereunder exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to seventy-five hundredths of one percent (0.75%) of
the final Purchase Price, in the aggregate, which amount shall constitute a
deductible (the "Deductible Basket"), and then Sellers and Buyers,
respectively, shall only be liable for Damages that exceed the Deductible
Basket.

  



  

(b) The aggregate liability of Sellers for Damages pursuant to
Section 11.2 and of Buyers for Damages pursuant to Section 11.3 shall
not exceed the amount of the final Purchase Price.

  



  

(c) Sellers collectively shall only be liable for Damages hereunder
up to the aggregate amount of the Escrow Funds, _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyers' recourse for Damages arising from fraud, Retained Liabilities and
Sellers' and the Companies' Fundamental Representations, shall not be limited
to the Escrow Funds.

  



  

(d) Except (i) in the case of actual fraud or willful misconduct,
(ii) with respect to matters covered by Section 2.2(d) and (iii) in the case
where a party seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant to Section 13.15,
from and after the Closing, the rights of the parties pursuant to this
Article XI and, in the case of Buyers, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to
claims for Damages (whether monetary or otherwise) relating to or arising
from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including in
any exhibit, schedule or certificate delivered hereunder, in each case
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at Law
or in equity, or otherwise.

  



  

(e) The representations, warranties and covenants of Sellers or the
Company in this Agreement or in any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith and Buyers' right to indemnification with respect hereto
and thereto shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of Buyer (including by any of its
Representatives) or by reason of the fact that Buyers or any of its
Representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be untrue or incorrect or by reason of Buyers'
waiver of any condition set forth in Section 8.1.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the indemnification obligations of Sellers under Article XI hereof
will not apply to a claim relating to any liability or loss resulting from
(i) any disclosure or request for investigation by any Buyer Indemnified
Party to or of any Governmental Body, except where required by applicable Law,
(ii) any investigation of environmental conditions, including soil, air or
water testing or sampling, undertaken by or on behalf of Buyer, unless such
investigation was required under applicable Law, or (iii) Buyer (A)

reasonably necessary to bring a condition into compliance with applicable Law.

  



    

54

(g) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under
Section 11.2 or 11.3 shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment to the extent actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party from any third party with respect thereto
(net of costs of collection and any increase in premiums resulting from making
any claim thereunder). In the event that an insurance or other recovery is
made by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages for which any such
Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate
amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to such Person.

  



  

(h) Any Indemnified Party shall take all steps required by Law to
mitigate any Damages incurred by such party upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
indemnification rights hereunder.

  



  

11.6  Waiver. The parties acknowledge that, except for the
representations and warranties contained in or made pursuant to Article III,
IV and Article V hereof, or in any certificate or schedule delivered pursuant
to this Agreement or in the case of actual fraud, no party, nor their
respective representatives: (i) will be deemed to have made any
representations, warranties or assurances of any kind, and (ii) will have any
liability or obligation in respect of any oral or written statement or
assurance made in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

11.7 Procedures for Indemnification.

  



  

(a) Subject to the limitation set forth in this Article XI, any
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party that desires to seek
indemnification under any part of this Article XI (an "Indemnified Party")
shall give notice (a "Claim Notice") in writing to each party responsible or
alleged to be responsible for indemnification hereunder (an
"Indemnitor") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, the
parties known to be involved, and the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
provide such notice (subject to Section 11.4) shall not release the
Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this Article XI except to the
extent the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure. If the matter
to which a claim relates shall not have been resolved as of the date of the
Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall estimate the amount of the claim in
the Claim Notice, but also specify therein that the claim has not yet been
liquidated (an "Unliquidated Claim"). If an Indemnified Party gives a Claim
Notice for an Unliquidated Claim, the Indemnified Party shall also give a
second notice (the "Liquidated Claim Notice") within sixty (60) days after
the matter giving rise to the claim becomes finally resolved, and the
Liquidated Claim Notice shall specify the amount of the claim. Each
Indemnitor to which a Claim Notice is given shall respond to any Indemnified
Party that has given such Claim Notice (a "Claim Response") within thirty
(30) days (the "Response Period") after receipt of the Claim Notice. Any
Claim Notice or Claim Response shall be given in accordance with the notice
requirements hereunder, and any Claim Response shall specify whether or not
the Indemnitor giving the Claim Response disputes the claim described in the
Claim Notice. If any Indemnitor fails to give a Claim Response within the
Response Period, such Indemnitor shall be deemed not to dispute the claim
described in the related Claim Notice. If any Indemnitor elects not to dispute
a claim described in a Claim Notice, whether by failing to give a timely
Claim Response or otherwise, then the amount of such claim, as provided in
the Liquidated Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed to be an obligation
of such Indemnitor.

  



    

55 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) If any Indemnitor shall be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified
Party hereunder, such Indemnitor shall pay to such Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after the last day of the Response Period the amount to which
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled. If any Indemnitor fails to pay all
or part of any indemnification obligation when due, then such Indemnitor shall
also be obligated to pay to the applicable Indemnified Party interest on the
unpaid amount for each day during which the obligation remains unpaid at an
annual rate equal to the Prime Rate (in effect on the first Business Day of
each calendar quarter), which shall apply to the amount of the unpaid
obligation during such calendar quarter.

  



  

(c) Within five (5) days from the date on which any Buyer
Indemnified Party becomes entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
11.7(b), the parties shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent as to (i) the amount of funds to be dispersed from the Escrow Funds,
and (ii) instructions as to the manner in which such funds shall be dispersed
by the Escrow Agent.

  



  

11.8 Third Party Claims. In the event that an Indemnified Party desires
to make a claim against any Indemnitor in connection with any action, suit,
proceeding or demand at any time instituted against or made upon the
Indemnified Party by any third party for which the Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification under this Article XI (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly (but in no event later than 30 days after the
event) notify Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim and of the Indemnified
Party's claim of indemnification with respect thereto. The Indemnitor shall
have forty-five (45) days after receipt of such notice (or by such earlier
date as may be necessary under applicable procedural rules in order to file a
timely appearance and response) to notify the Indemnified Party if the
Indemnitor has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant
to the terms hereof, the Indemnitor shall be entitled at its own expense to
conduct and control the defense and settlement of such Third Party
Claim through counsel of its own choosing; provided that (a) the Indemnitor
shall conduct such defense actively and diligently, (b) the Indemnified Party
may participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
at its own expense ( _provided_ , that the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall not be recoverable from the Indemnitor under this Article XI),
(c) the Indemnified Party will not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of the
Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such payment, and (d)
the Indemnitor may not settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry
of judgment with respect thereto without the Indemnified Party's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
unless (x) the relief consists solely of money damages (all of which the
Indemnitor shall pay), (y) such settlement or compromise includes a provision
whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases each Indemnified
Party from all Liability with respect thereto and (z) such settlement or
compromise does not include any admission of fault or wrongdoing on the part
of the Indemnified Party, and provided further, that in the event that the
Indemnified Party withholds its consent to any such settlement of, or entry of
judgment with respect to, a Third Party Claim (other than a Third Party Claim
involving a claim for equitable relief involving the ongoing operations of the
Company), (i) the Indemnitor's maximum liability under this Article 11 with
respect to such Third Party Claim shall be limited to the amount that would
be payable by the Indemnitor under this Section 11.8 if such settlement had
been entered into or such judgment had been entered. If the Indemnitor fails
to notify the Indemnified Party as required above after receipt of the
Indemnified Party's notice of a Third Party Claim or fails to conduct the
defense as required above, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim at the expense of the
Indemnitor, provided that the Indemnified Party may not settle any Third
Party Claim without the consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of the Indemnitor ( _provided_  that the Indemnitor has
admitted that it is responsible for the indemnification of such claims
pursuant to this Article XI). In all cases with respect to Third Party
Claims, Buyers and Sellers shall provide reasonable cooperation to each other
in defense of such Third Party Claims, including by making employees,
information and documentation reasonably available (including for purposes of
fact finding, consultation, interviews, depositions and, if required, as
witnesses) and providing such information, testimony and access to their
books and records, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, in
each case as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or
defense.

11.9 No Punitive Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no Indemnitor shall, in any event, be liable to
any Indemnified Party for any punitive damages of such Indemnified Party
(other than punitive damages payable by an Indemnified Party pursuant to a
Third Party Claim against such Indemnified Party and subject to the
other limitations of this Article XI).

  



  

11.10 Materiality Qualifiers. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that, for purposes of this Article XI, Damages shall be calculated without
regard to any Materiality Qualifiers contained in any breached representation
or warranty, provided that Materiality Qualifiers shall apply with respect to
any determination of whether a breach of a representation or warranty has
occurred.

  



  

11.11 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payment. The parties agree to treat any
indemnity payments under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, unless otherwise required by law.

  



  

11.12 Escrow Release. In accordance with the Escrow Agreement, Buyers
and Sellers shall cause a portion equal to (a) $5,000,000 of the Escrow Funds
minus any amount due to Buyers pursuant to Section 2.2(d) to be released to
Sellers within 5 days following the final resolution of the Closing Statement
pursuant to Section 2.2(c); (b) the greater of zero and the amount of funds
remaining subject to the Escrow Agreement on the last day of the
eighteenth (18th) month after the Closing Date in excess of 50% of the Escrow
Funds to be released to Sellers upon the first Business Day following the
eighteenth (18th) month after the Closing Date; (c) the greater of zero and
the amount of funds remaining subject to the Escrow Agreement on the last day
of the thirty-sixth (36th) month after the Closing Date in excess
of $4,000,000 of the Escrow Funds to be released to Sellers upon the first
Business Day following the thirty-sixth (36th) month after the Closing Date;
and (d) the funds remaining subject to the Escrow Agreement on the last day of
the seventy-second (72nd) month after the Closing Date to be released to
Sellers upon the first Business Day following the seventy-second (72nd) month
after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that as
of any release date specified in (b), (c) or (d) claims against the funds
remaining pursuant to the Escrow Agreement by any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article XI are pending, or claims by the Company against AK
Steel pursuant to the terms of Section 7.4 are pending, the amount of any
such claims shall not be considered to be "funds remaining subject to the
Escrow Agreement" for purposes of determining the amounts to be released
pursuant to (b), (c) or (d) above. All funds remaining subject to the Escrow
Agreement following such dates and distributions that are subject to timely
delivered Claim Notices shall be disbursed in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement upon final disposition of such claims or upon resolution of the
claims against AK Steel, whichever is applicable.

Article XII 
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

12.1 Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes.

  



  

(a) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company relating to income Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period. All such Tax Returns with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods shall be prepared in a manner consistent with most recent past
practice except as otherwise required by applicable Law, _provided_ that the
Company shall make an election under Section 754 of the Code (and any
corresponding provisions of state and local Law) to be effective for the
taxable year that ends on the Closing Date and _provided,_ _further,_ that
the basis adjustment required under Section 743 shall be prepared based on an
allocation statement, initially prepared by the Buyers and provided to the
Sellers for review and comment as soon as practicable, but no later than 120
days, following the Closing Date, which comments Buyers will consider in good
faith for inclusion in the final allocation statement, the final version of
which shall be subject to consent of Buyers and Sellers (not to be
unreasonably withheld). Sellers shall permit Buyers and the Company to review
and approve each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence at least
20 days prior to filing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
The Company shall be responsible for paying the reasonable fees and expenses
associated with preparing such Tax Returns only to the extent such fees and
expenses are paid prior to the Closing Date or accrued as a current liability
in determining the Net Working Capital on the Closing Statement.
Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of any Taxes imposed upon income
of the Company for the period through the end of the Closing Date for which
Sellers are otherwise responsible as a result of having been general partners
of the Company during such period. Any income for such period shall be
apportioned between Sellers and Buyers, based on the portion of such period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such period beginning after the
Closing Date, as provided below. For purposes of this paragraph (a)
and determining Pre-Closing Taxes for a period commencing prior to the
Closing date and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the
determination of the items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the
Acquired Company shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the end of the
Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following
the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the
Acquired Companies for the Straddle Period shall be apportioned between such
two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming
that the books of the Company were closed at the end of the Closing Date; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances, deductions or Taxes that
are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation,
shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on a daily
basis; provided further that any real and personal property Taxes shall be
apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis.

--- 

    



  

(b) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of
any Acquired Company due on or prior to the Closing. After the
Closing, Buyers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of any Acquired Company other than those specifically
set forth in paragraph (a) above. All Tax Returns with respect to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods shall be prepared in a manner consistent with most recent past
practice except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyers shall permit
Sellers to review and approve any Tax Returns relating to Taxes for which
Sellers are liable under Section 12.1 at least 20 days (in the case of income
Tax Returns), or as soon as reasonably practicable (in the case of all other
such Tax Returns), before the extended due date for filing any such Tax
Returns, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the case of any
disagreement between Buyers and Sellers regarding any Tax Return furnished
for approval under this Section 12.1, such disagreement shall be resolved by
an independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to Buyers and Sellers (the
"Tax Accountant"), and any such determination by the Tax Accountant shall be
final. The fees and expenses of the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally
by Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. If the Tax
Accountant does not resolve any differences between Buyers and Sellers with
respect to such Tax Return at least two days prior to the due date therefor,
such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the party having the
responsibility hereunder for filing such Tax Return and amended to reflect the
Tax Accountant's resolution.

  



  

(c) The Company, Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate with each other
in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes in such a manner as not unreasonably to
interfere with the conduct of the business of the other party. The Company,
Buyers and Sellers agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Company, Buyers or
Sellers, any extensions of the statute of limitations) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other parties reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if any of the other parties so requests, the Company, Buyers
or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to
take possession of such books and records.

  



  

12.2 Transfer Taxes. Any transfer Taxes imposed by any federal,
state, local or other taxing body as a result of the consummation of the
Acquisition shall be paid 50% by Buyers and 50% by Sellers, and Sellers will,
at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such transfer Taxes; provided that Buyers shall
cooperate in connection with filing such Tax Returns to the extent requested
by Sellers.

  



    

59

--- 

    



  

12.3 Sales and Use Tax. Buyers acknowledge that Sellers intend to
negotiate voluntary disclosure agreements ("VDA's") with various U.S. states
in which the Company sells its products through distributors. Sellers shall
consult with Buyers and consider in good faith Buyers' advice in determining
the states with which the Company should enter into VDA's. Sellers shall have
the right to (i) obtain such information and take all such reasonable steps
as Sellers deem necessary to verify that all required sales and/or use taxes
were paid in any state where the Company would be required to withhold and
submit such sales and/or use taxes, and (ii) negotiate VDA's with such
states to settle any potential tax exposure associated with the possible
failure by the Company to withhold and submit sales and/or use taxes and any
related returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided, however_ , that (x)
Sellers shall keep Buyers reasonably informed of the status of the
negotiations, consult with Buyers regarding the resolution of any issue that
could materially affect the Buyers, and otherwise permit Buyers to
participate in the negotiation of the VDA's and (y) no such VDA's
shall impose any additional liabilities or obligations on the Company after
the Closing or on the Buyers; and _provided further_  that the terms of any
such VDA's shall not impose any unreasonable restrictions on the Company or
the Buyers in connection with the operation of the Company's business after
Closing, _provided further_ , that administrative and reporting costs and
obligations resulting from the Company becoming subject to compliance with a
state's Tax withholding and submission Laws as a result of a VDA shall not
constitute additional liabilities or obligations or unreasonable restrictions
for purposes of subsection (y). The Buyers shall cooperate with Sellers in
all reasonable respects, including executing such VDA's, and such
instruments, limited powers of attorney, and other documents, and taking such
actions at Sellers' cost, on behalf of the Company, as may be required to
carry out the intent of the foregoing provisions. For the avoidance of doubt,
Sellers shall remain liable under the terms of this Agreement for any Pre-
Closing Taxes of or with respect to the Acquired Companies as provided in
Section 11.2(d).

  



  

12.4 Foreign Filings. Buyers will, and will cause the Company to,
provide sufficient notice to Sellers prior to filing any tax returns in any
of the foreign jurisdictions disclosed to Buyers on Schedule 12.4 in which
the Acquired Companies conducted business prior to Closing, and will
cooperate with Sellers as reasonably required, in each case to allow Sellers
the opportunity to negotiate the equivalent of VDA's with such jurisdictions
to the extent that Sellers deem it appropriate or necessary to do so;
_provided_ that Buyers shall not be required to take any actions that would
delay or hinder the timely filing of any Tax Returns that Buyers in their
sole discretion determine are required to be filed. Sellers shall keep Buyers
reasonably informed of the status of any negotiation with the foreign tax
authorities, consult with Buyers regarding the resolution of any issue that
could materially affect the Buyers, and otherwise permit Buyers to participate
in the negotiation. Sellers shall not enter into any binding agreement or
other arrangement with any foreign tax authority that could impose any
additional liabilities or obligations on the Company after the Closing or on
the Buyers, _provided that_ , that administrative and reporting costs and
obligations resulting from the Company becoming subject to compliance with
such foreign jurisdiction's Tax Laws either as a result of such a VDA or of
Buyers' determination to file tax returns in such jurisdiction shall
not constitute additional liabilities or obligations or unreasonable
restrictions for purposes of the immediately preceding clause. For the
avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall remain liable under the terms of this
Agreement for any Pre-Closing Taxes of or with respect to the Acquired
Companies as provided in Section 11.2(d).

  



  

12.5 Tax Refunds. The Sellers will be entitled to any Tax refunds or
Tax credits, including any interest paid therewith, in respect of Taxes paid
by the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, other
than any Tax refund or Tax credit (i) resulting from the carryback of any Tax
attribute generated after the Closing Date or (ii) accounted for in
determining Net Working Capital, _provided_ that Sellers shall have no right
to any such refunds or credits that are received more than thirty-six (36)
months after the Closing Date. Subject to the foregoing, the Buyers agree to
cooperate, and to cause the Acquired Companies to cooperate, with the
Sellers, at the Seller's expense, in obtaining all Tax refunds with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and to promptly pay or cause the Acquired
Companies to pay such amounts to Seller (net of any associated costs or
Taxes) after receipt of such amounts.

12.6 Amendment of Tax Returns. Except as required by applicable Law,
the Buyers shall not, and the Buyers shall cause its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) not to, amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any
Tax Return or Tax election of any of the Acquired Companies with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period if such action would reasonably be expected to result
in liability to Sellers without the prior written consent of the Sellers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
Buyers fail to effect the Closing when required by Section 2.3 for any or
no reason or otherwise prior to the Closing breaches this Agreement or fails
to perform hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise), then, (i) except for the right of Sellers to

only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 13.15(c), Sellers' and their
Affiliates' sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Buyer Related Party for any pre-
Closing breach, loss or damage shall be to terminate this Agreement as
provided in Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.1(f), and receive payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee, to the extent provided by Section 10.2(b) and (ii)
upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, as provided in the immediately

and agreements contained in this Agreement or arising from any claim or cause
of action that any Seller Related Party may have relating to pre-Closing
matters under this Agreement, including for a breach of Section 2.3 hereof
(and including relating to the Debt Financing, Debt Financing Sources or the

Financing Affiliates or the Debt Commitment Letter) by any of them or any of
their respective Affiliates, and seek to cause any such Action by any of
their respective Affiliates, any of their or their respective
Affiliates' former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
stockholders or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller
Related Parties") against Buyers or any other Buyer Related Party to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days, after payment of the Reverse Termination Fee.

  



  

(b) In the event that Sellers shall be entitled to terminate the
Agreement as provided by Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.1(f) and receive a
Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.2(b), except for the payment by
Buyers of the Reverse Termination Fee when required and to the extent set
forth in Section 10.2(b), (i) none of Buyers nor any other Buyer Related Party
shall have any liability to Sellers or any Seller Related Party in connection
with this Agreement (including in respect of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement) or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) in no event shall any party hereto nor any
Buyer Related Party be liable for or obligated to pay consequential, special,
multiple, punitive or exemplary damages including, damages arising from loss
of profits, business opportunities or goodwill in respect of any breach or
failure to comply with this Agreement or in respect of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt Financing and the Debt
Commitment Letter), and (iii) in no event shall any Seller Related Party seek
on behalf of any Seller Related Party any damages from, or otherwise
bring any Action against, any Buyer Related Party in connection with this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder (including any
Action related to the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Sources, the Debt
Financing Affiliates or the Debt Commitment Letter), other than an Action to
recover payment of the Reverse Termination Fee to the extent such fee is not
paid when due pursuant to Section 10.2(b) or for specific performance,
injunction or other equitable remedy in accordance with this Section 11.3.
Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability of the Buyer Related Parties for any breach of
this agreement or failure to perform hereunder (in any case, whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), shall in all cases
be limited to the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee. While Sellers may
pursue both a grant of specific performance, injunction or other equitable
remedies under Section 13.15(c) and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
under Section 10.2(b), under no circumstances shall the Seller Related
Parties, taken as a whole, be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant
of specific performance of the obligation to consummate the Closing and
monetary damages in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this
Agreement, including all or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee and in
no event shall Buyers be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. In no event shall any Seller Related Party be entitled to
seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement other than in
accordance with this Section 13.15.

Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement, without any bond or other security being
required, such requirement being hereby waived, and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, _provided_  that Sellers shall be entitled
to seek specific performance of Buyers' obligations to consummate the Closing
