No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of
Buyers or, to the knowledge of Buyers, any other party under the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV and performance by Sellers and the Company of their respective obligations
hereunder, upon receipt of the proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyers will have access at the Closing to sufficient
funds to (i) pay the Purchase Price, and (ii) pay all other amounts contemplated by this Agreement to be paid by it and to perform
its obligations hereunder.</FONT></P>

the defense of such Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnitor, provided that the Indemnified Party may not settle any

necessary in connection with the contest or defense.</FONT></P>
