 **EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;**

  

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

5.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company:

  

(a) Conversion of Securities and Merger Consideration. Each Company
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Excluded Company Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the
right to receive

  

(i) the Per Share Cash Amount, without interest; and

  

(ii) a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio.

  

At the Effective Time, all Company Shares will be cancelled and retired, and
will cease to exist, and (x) each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of these Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares)
and (y) each uncertificated Company Share (a " _Registered Company Share_ ")
registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (other than
Excluded Company Shares), will thereafter represent only the right to the
Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares have been converted
pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) and any distribution or dividend pursuant to
Section 5.2(c), in each case without interest.

  

(b) Cancellation of Shares. Each Excluded Company Share will, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder, be cancelled
and retired without payment of any consideration and will cease to exist.

  

(c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each of the outstanding shares of
common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Company.

   

       

5.2

  |  

Exchange of Certificates for Shares. 

---|--- 
 

  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Closing, Parent will deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares and Dissenting Shares),
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be exchanged
for Company Shares in the Merger and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid
in the Merger pursuant to Sections 5.1 in exchange for Company Shares (the
cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.2(c), being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Parent will cause transmittal materials
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing to be
mailed as soon as practicable after the Effective Time by the Exchange Agent
to each holder of record of Company

  



  

15

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares and Dissenting Shares) as of the
Effective Time represented by Certificates. The transmittal materials will
advise the holders of Company Shares of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the procedure for surrendering Certificates representing the Company Shares to
the Exchange Agent. Upon the surrender by a holder of Company Shares of a
Certificate representing such Company Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with Section 5.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the terms of the transmittal materials, each holder of Company Shares
will be entitled to receive, pursuant to Section 5.1 in exchange therefor (i)
a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that the holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article V, and/or (ii)
a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) of (A) any cash payable pursuant to Section 5.2(e) in lieu of
fractional shares, plus (B) cash payable pursuant to Section 5.1, plus (C) any
unpaid dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common
Stock that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 5.2(c),
and, in each case, the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates. If a transfer of ownership of Company Shares formerly
represented by a Certificate is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender
of the Certificate and any other dividends or distributions in respect of the
Certificate, shall be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect the transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If any certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the exchange that the Person requesting the exchange will pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or will establish to the
satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that the Tax has been paid or is
not applicable.

_Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(i) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in
respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at
or after the Effective Time, that declaration must include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement and the dividends or other distributions payable in
respect of any such shares of Parent Common Stock not then issued in exchange
for surrendered Certificates. No dividends or other distributions in respect
of Parent Common Stock will be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the Certificate is surrendered for exchange in accordance
with this Article V. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of the
Certificate, there will be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to those whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and not previously paid to the holder and (B) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with

  



  

16

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

respect to those whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

  

(ii) Registered holders of unsurrendered Certificates will be entitled to
vote after the Effective Time, at any meeting of Parents stockholders with a
record date at or after the Effective Time, the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock represented by those Certificates, as the case may be,
regardless of whether those holders have surrendered their Certificates or
delivered duly executed transmittal materials.

  

(d) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Company Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock but for this Section 5.2(e) will be entitled to receive an amount
in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying this fraction (rounded to
the nearest one-hundredth of a share) by the average of the closing price of a
share of Parent Common Stock, as reported in The Wall Street Journal
(Northeast edition), for the five trading days ending on the trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Period; Unclaimed Stock_. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments and any shares of
Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company
one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent. Any
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article V will thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any shares of
Parent Common Stock and payment of any cash, dividends and other distributions
in respect thereof payable or deliverable pursuant to Section 5.1, Section
5.2(c) and Section 5.2(e) upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), in each case, without any interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person will be liable to any former holder of
Company Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming the Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
posting by that Person of a bond in the form customarily required by the
Company as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, Parent will issue the shares of Parent Common
Stock, and the Exchange Agent will issue any cash, dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof issuable and/or payable in exchange for the
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(h) _Registered Company Shares_. Parent, without any action on the part
of any holder, will cause the Exchange Agent to (i) issue, as of the Effective
Time, to each

  



  

17

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

holder of Registered Company Shares that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article V
and (ii) mail to each holder of Registered Company Shares (other than Excluded
Company Shares and Dissenting Shares) a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings) of any cash payable in respect of the
stockholders Company Shares pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.2(e). Parent will
also cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each such holder materials (in a form
to be reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time)
advising the holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of
the holders Company Shares into Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger.

  

(i) _Source of Funds_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent agrees that at least $5 million of the cash transferred
by Parent to the Exchange Fund shall come from funds owned by Parent prior to
the Closing Date.

Dissenters Rights; Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. 

---|--- 
 

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by stockholders properly exercising
appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") will not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders have failed to
perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under
the DGCL. Dissenting Shares will be treated in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right to appraisal, such holders Company Shares will thereupon be
converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has
been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration without
any interest thereon. The Company will give Parent (a) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of
Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and (b) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company will not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the
Company, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands.

  

(b) If prior to the Effective Time there is a change in the number of
Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Company Shares or shares of Parent Common
Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a distribution, reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio will be equitably adjusted to
eliminate the effects of this event on the Merger Consideration.

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

(a) As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Option,
whether vested or unvested, will be converted into an option to acquire a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the
nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to the
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Option
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest whole
cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Company Share of that Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Option Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options will be determined in
a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Company Option to which
Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the option will be determined
in accordance with the foregoing, subject to those adjustments as are
necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.
Except as specifically provided above following the Effective Time, each
converted Company Option will continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Award will be converted into the
right to acquire, or receive benefits measured by the value of the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of
Company Shares subject to such Company Award (or the number of Company Shares
with respect to which the Company Award is denominated) immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, and each right will
otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to that right
under the relevant Company Stock Plan or other Company Compensation and
Benefit Plan.

  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors
(or a committee thereof) will adopt amendments to, or make determinations with
respect to, the Companys stock-based plans, individual agreements evidencing
the grant of Company Awards or Company Options, and Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans, if necessary, to implement the provisions of this Section 5.4.

  

(d) Parent will take all actions as are necessary for the assumption of
the Companys stock-based plans and the individual agreements of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries evidencing the grant of Company Options or Company
Awards pursuant to this Section 5.4, including the reservation, issuance
(subject to this Section 5.4(d)) and listing of Parent Common Stock as
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.4. If
registration of any interests in the Companys stock-based plans or individual
agreements evidencing the grant of Company Options or Company Awards or the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder is required under the
Securities Act, Parent will file with the SEC, prior to the Effective Time, a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to
those interests or Parent Common Stock, will cause the registration statement
to be effective as of the Effective Time and will use reasonable best efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement (and to maintain
the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained in that
registration statement and comply with any applicable state securities or
"blue sky" laws) for so long as the relevant converted Company Options or
Company Awards, as applicable, remain outstanding and the registration of
interests or the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder (and
compliance with any state laws)

  



  

19

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

continues to be required. Promptly after the Closing, Parent will deliver to
the holders of Company Options and Company Awards appropriate notices setting
forth the holders rights pursuant to the respective Company stock-based plans
and agreements evidencing the grant of the Company Options and Company Awards,
and stating that the Company Options and Company Awards and agreements have
been assumed by Parent and will continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions subject to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.4 and
after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Companys stock-based
plans and the applicable agreements.

  

5.5 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

purchase or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity securities of any
of the Companys Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or

indirectly, by the Company with respect to the voting of or the right to
participate in dividends or other earnings on any capital stock of any
Subsidiary of the Company owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(c) Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to, and has taken all corporate action
necessary to, execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and consummate the Merger, subject, in the case of the consummation
of the Merger, to the Company Requisite Vote. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The Board of Directors of the
Company has (i) unanimously adopted resolutions approving this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, declaring the
advisability of this Agreement and recommending the adoption of this Agreement
by the holders of Company Shares by the Company Requisite Vote (the "
_Company Recommendation_ "), (ii) received the separate opinions of Evercore
Group, Inc., Lehman Brothers, Inc. and The Blackstone Group L.P., the
Companys financial advisors, each dated as of the date of this Agreement, to
the effect that the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of the
Company Shares in the Merger is fair to those holders from a financial point
of view and (iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the holders of
Company Shares for the purpose of acting on the Agreement. The Company
Requisite Vote is the only vote of the stockholders of the Company required in
connection with the Merger.

  

(d) Governmental Filings; No Violations. (i) No consent, approval,
order, license, permit or authorization of, or registration, declaration,
notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary or required to be
obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger, except for those (A) required by
(1) Section 2.3, (2) the HSR Act, (3) the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
(4) Environmental Laws, (5) NYSE rules and regulations, (6) the FERC under

set forth in clauses (2), (6), and (7) above being the " _Material Company
Regulatory Consents_ "); or (B) that the failure to make or obtain would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, in the
Companys reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to prevent or
materially delay the receipt of the Material Company Regulatory Consents.

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of the Charter or By-Laws of the Company,
(B) a breach or violation of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
similar organizational documents of any Subsidiaries of the Company, (C) a
breach or violation of, or a default or termination (or right of termination)
under, the acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of any Lien
on the Companys assets or the assets of any of its Subsidiaries (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any Contract binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming the filings, notices,
reports, consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations
referred to in Section 6.1(d)(i) are made or obtained, any Law or
governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject or (D) any change in the rights or obligations
of any party under any of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Contracts,
except, in the case of clauses (B), (C) and (D), for any breach, violation,
termination, default, acceleration, creation or change that has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(e) Reports and Financial Statements. The Company has filed or
furnished with the SEC all Company Reports. Each Company Report, when and as
filed or furnished with the SEC, complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and Sarbanes-
Oxley. As of their respective dates (and, if amended or supplemented, as of
the date of any such amendment or supplement) and as filed, the Company
Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

  

(i) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. These disclosure controls and procedures
were designed by the management of the Company, or caused to be designed under
their supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the
management of the Company by others within those entities, and to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including policies and procedures that (A) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (B) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (C) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. The Companys management has
disclosed to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the

required to be disclosed in any Company Report has been so disclosed.

actions, suits, arbitrations, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or

(i) Section 6.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list,
as of the date of this Agreement, of each Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan. Each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS has been separately identified in Section
6.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies of each
Company Compensation and Benefit Plan listed in Section 6.1(h)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter have been provided or made available to Parent.

  

(ii) Each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than "multiemployer
plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer
Plan_ "), has been operated in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and is in substantial compliance with, to the extent applicable, ERISA,
the Code, and other applicable Laws. Each ERISA Plan that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "
_Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or has
applied to the IRS for a favorable determination letter and no event has
occurred and no condition exists which could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the qualified status of such plan. There is no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims relating to the
Company Compensation and Benefit Plans, other than the Multiemployer Plans,
except for routine claims for benefits and immaterial claims. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect
to any ERISA Plan that would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred or reasonably expects to incur any material tax or penalty imposed by
Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

  

(iii) No material liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has

Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Compensation or Benefit Plan
currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan
of any entity which is considered one employer with the Company under Section
4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (a " _Company ERISA Affiliate_ ").
The Company and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur
any withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E
of Title

Material Adverse Effect.

  

(iv) As of the date of this Agreement, all contributions required to be made
under each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made and all
obligations in respect of each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan have been
properly accrued and reflected to the extent required by GAAP on the most
recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the
Company Reports as filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement,
except, in the case of each of the foregoing, as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither any Company
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of any Company ERISA Affiliate has
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no Company ERISA
Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any
Pension Plans or to any single-employer plan of any Company ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

  

(v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health or life benefits under any ERISA Plan or collective bargaining
agreement, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of

Subsidiaries from amending or terminating, without liability in excess of
previously accrued benefits, any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan
providing health or medical benefits in respect of any active or former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(vi) There has been no amendment to or announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that
would increase materially the expense of maintaining any plan above the level
of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year, except as
required by Law. Except as provided in this Agreement or as may be required by
Law or by any of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans listed on Section
6.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the negotiation or
execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement, receipt
of approval or clearance from one or more Governmental Entities of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
(A) entitle any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance pay
or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the
date of this Agreement; (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or result in
any other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Compensation and
Benefit Plan; or (C) limit or restrict the right of the Company, or, after the

not reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has obtained
and is in compliance with all Permits necessary for the lawful conduct of its
business as presently conducted, except for those the absence of which, or the
failure to be in compliance with, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is, and
has been, in compliance in all material respects with Sarbanes-Oxley and the
applicable listing standards and corporate governance rules and regulations of

employee benefits, which are the subject of Section 6.1(h), environmental

full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, except to the extent
that (i) they have previously expired or otherwise terminated in accordance
with their terms or (ii) the failure to be in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
counterparty to any Company Material Contract, has violated any provision of,
or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any
Company Material Contract, except in each case for those violations or
defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Company Material
Contract has been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement

modifications which have been filed or furnished as an exhibit to a
subsequently filed or furnished Company Report, or provided to Parent prior to
the date hereof.

all corporate or similar action necessary to, execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement, the Asset Sale Agreement and the Partnership

the " _Material Parent Regulatory Consents_ "), and (B) that the failure to
make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent,
there are no facts or circumstances relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that, in Parents reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely
to prevent or materially delay the receipt of the Material Parent Regulatory
Consents.

both) pursuant to, any Contract binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or, assuming the filings, notices, reports, consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations referred to in Section 6.2(d)(i) are
made or obtained, any Law or governmental or non-governmental permit or
license to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (D) any
change in the rights or obligations of any party under any of Parents, Merger
Subs or any of their respective Subsidiaries Contracts, except, in the case

with the SEC all Parent Reports. Each Parent Report, as and when filed or
furnished with the SEC, complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley. As of
their respective dates and as filed with the SEC (and, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of any such amendment or supplement) the Parent
Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

  

(ii) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. These disclosure controls and procedures were
designed by the management of Parent, or caused to be designed under their
supervision, to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including
its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Parent by
others within those entities, and to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies
and procedures that (A) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable

  



  

35

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of Parent, (B) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
Parent, and (C) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets
that could have a material effect on its financial statements. Parents
management has disclosed to Parents outside auditors and the audit committee
of the Board of Directors of Parent (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting in the case of clause (A) or (B), to the extent such
deficiencies, weaknesses or fraud was discovered by Parents management as
part of its most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Any material
change in internal control over financial reporting required to be disclosed
in any Parent Report has been so disclosed.

  

(iii) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, the notes, if any,
thereto) included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports as
filed with the SEC complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and
except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) and present fairly in all material respects the financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, as of their dates, and the results of operations
and cash flow for the periods set forth therein (subject to the notes and, in
the case of unaudited statements, normal year-end audit adjustments that were
not or are not expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially
adverse to Parent), in each case in conformity with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted in the Parent Reports as
filed with the SEC.

  

(iv) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Parent (or each former principal executive officer and each former
principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or
Sections 302 and 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to the Parent Reports. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" have the meanings ascribed to those terms under
Sarbanes-Oxley. Since the effectiveness of Sarbanes-Oxley, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has arranged any outstanding "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of Sarbanes-
Oxley.

failure of which to make in compliance with all requirements of applicable
Law, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Adverse Effect.

consent) between

  



  

37

the date hereof and the Effective Date, would constitute a breach of Section

(g) Litigation. There are no civil, criminal or administrative
actions, suits, arbitrations, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, except for those that have not had and would not reasonably
be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any order,
writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award that would reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any order of any Governmental Entity that,

Employee Benefits. 

---|--- 
 

  

(i) Each Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than Multiemployer
Plans, is in substantial compliance with, to the extent applicable, ERISA, the
Code, and other applicable Laws. Each Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan
which is an ERISA Plan that is a Pension Plan and that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS or has applied to the IRS for a favorable
determination letter and no event has occurred and no condition exists which

plan. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened litigation relating to Parent Compensation and
Benefit Plans, other than the Multiemployer Plans, except for routine claims
for benefits and immaterial claims. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that
would subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any material tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur
any material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section
502 of ERISA.

  

(ii) No material liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has

by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with Parent under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code (" _Parent ERISA Affiliate_ "). Parent and its Subsidiaries have not
incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a
Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of Parent ERISA Affiliate), except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(iii) As of the date of this Agreement, all contributions required to be made
under each Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan have been

  



  

38

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

timely made and all obligations in respect of each Parent Compensation and
Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected to the extent required
by GAAP on the most recent consolidated balance sheet as filed or incorporated
by reference in Parent Reports prior to the date of this Agreement, except, in
the case of each of the foregoing, as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither any Parent Pension Plan nor any
single-employer plan of any Parent ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no Parent ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding
funding waiver. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Pension Plans or to any single-employer
plan of any Parent ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code.

  

(i) Compliance with Laws; Licenses. Parent and its Subsidiaries have
not violated any Law, except for violations that have not had and would not
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance
with all Permits necessary for the lawful conduct of its business as presently
conducted, except for those the absence of which, or the failure to be in
compliance with, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent is, and has been, in compliance in
all material respects with Sarbanes-Oxley and the applicable listing
standards and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. This
Section 6.2(i) does not relate to matters with respect to employee benefits,
which are the subject of Section 6.2(h), environmental matters, which are the
subject of Section 6.2(m), tax matters, which are the subject of Section
6.2(n), or labor matters, which are the subject of Section 6.2(o).

effect and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, except to the extent that (i) they have
previously expired or otherwise terminated in accordance with their terms or
(ii) the failure to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any counterparty to any
such Parent Material Contract, has violated any provision of, or committed
or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Parent Material
Contract, except in each case for those violations or defaults which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. No Parent Material Contract has been amended
or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, except for amendments or

Asset Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) Corporate Authority; Approval. The Asset Purchaser has the
requisite corporate power and authority to, and it has taken all corporate
action necessary to, execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this

reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay

Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective

agree or consent to Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries taking any action, or agreeing to any restriction, condition or
conduct, with respect to any of the businesses, assets or operations of

expected

to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties,
assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise), business or results of
operations of the Post-Sale Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(2) the cumulative impact of these actions, restrictions, conditions and
conduct relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably be

reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, properties, assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise),
business or results of operations of such assets and partnership interests,
considered together (each, a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ "); it
being understood that (X) any requirement for the divestiture of assets of
Parent, the Post-Sale Company or any of the Subsidiaries of either may be
taken into account in determining whether a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect
would reasonably be expected to occur, and (Y) for purposes of determining
whether a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect would reasonably be expected to
occur both the positive and negative effects of any actions, conduct,
restrictions and conditions, including any sale, divestiture, licensing,
lease, disposition or change or proposed change in rates, will be taken into

stockholders of the Company in the Merger, are not conditioned upon or subject
to receipt of these authorizations or of an alternate source of funds for

by reason of job duties and years of service). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
except as provided in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement
obligates Parent, the Surviving Company or any affiliate of either to (i)
maintain any particular Company Compensation and Benefit Plan or (ii) retain
the employment of any Active Affected Employee. However, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Company to participate in Parents severance plan
following the Closing, in accordance with the terms of such plan, giving
effect to the Active Affected Employees service with the Company and its
affiliates. Parent shall continue to maintain such plan until at least
December 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs.

  

(b) Parent agrees that, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for purposes of accrual of pension benefits)
under the employee benefit plans, policies or arrangements of Parent and its
affiliates providing benefits to any Active Affected Employees after the
Effective Time, each Active Affected Employee will receive credit for his or
her service with the Company and its affiliates before the Effective Time
(including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which
the Company and its affiliates have given credit for prior service) to the
same extent that the Affected Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for this service under any similar or comparable Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans (except to the extent this credit would result
in a duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, if Active Affected
Employees or their dependents are included in any medical, dental, health or
other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement (a " _Successor Plan_ ")
other than the plan or plans in which they participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a " _Prior Plan_ "), each Active Affected Employee
immediately will be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all Successor Plans and these Successor Plans will not include any
restrictions, limitations or exclusionary provisions with respect to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions, any actively-at-work requirements or any
proof of insurability requirements (except to the extent these exclusions or
requirements were applicable under any similar Prior Plan at the time of
commencement of participation in such Successor Plan), and any eligible
expenses incurred by any Active Affected Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Prior Plan ending on the
date of the Active Affected Employees commencement of participation in the
Successor Plan

  



  

62

begins will be taken into account under the Successor Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to the Active Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if these amounts had been paid in accordance
with the Successor Plan.

  

(c) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, honor the terms of any collective bargaining agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

  

(d) Parent will or will cause the Surviving Company to, take all actions
set forth in Section 7.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

7.11 Expenses. Except as set forth in Sections 9.5(b) and 9.5(c),
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such
expense; _provided_ that (a) the Company and Parent will each bear and pay
one-half of the filing fees required to be paid in connection with the filings
under the HSR Act of the pre-merger notification and report forms relating to
the Merger and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the printing
and mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement; (b) Parent will promptly upon
request of the Company reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with its performance of its
obligations under Sections 7.5(d) in connection with any prospectus, offering
memorandum or other materials relating to a financing transaction undertaken
as proposed to be undertaken by Parent; and (c) Parent and the Asset Purchaser
will promptly upon request of the Company reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company at the request of
Parent or the Asset Purchaser, as the case may be, in connection with its
performance of its obligations under Section 7.5(h), which expenses shall be
paid (i) by Parent, in the case of expenses in connection with obligations,
the cost of which would be borne by Parent pursuant to Section 2.1 of the
Transition Services Agreement, or as requested by Parent, (ii) by the Asset
Purchaser, in the case of expenses in connection with obligations, the cost of
which would be borne by the Asset Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1 of the
Transition Services Agreement, or as requested by the Asset Purchaser and
(iii) 50% by Parent and 50% by the Asset Purchaser, in the case of expenses in
connection with obligations, the cost of which would be borne 50% by Parent
and 50% by the Asset Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Transition
Services Agreement.

  

7.12 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company will, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses
to, each Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to their capacities as directors or officers of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or as fiduciaries under Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans (or trusts thereunder) at or prior to the
Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, (i) to the same extent these individuals are

  



  

63

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to its Charter and By-Laws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with, or for the benefit of, any of these individuals and (ii) without regard
to the limitations in clause (i) above, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law.

  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
7.12(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, will promptly notify Parent and the Surviving Company, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent and the Surviving Company of any
liability they may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not
materially prejudice Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be. In
the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Company will
have the right to assume the defense and the Surviving Company will not be
liable to the Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense, except that, if the Surviving Company elects not
to assume the defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving
Company and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Company will pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of this counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Company will be
obligated pursuant to this Section 7.12(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any matter in any jurisdiction (unless there is
a conflict of interest as provided above), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any matter and (iii) the Surviving Company will
not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent.

  

(c) Parent will cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving
Company will, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, maintain DandO
Insurance with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_
that if the DandO Insurance to be maintained during the six-year period expires,
is terminated or cancelled, or if the annual premium therefor is increased to
an amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
its DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement as disclosed in
Section 7.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (this amount, the " _Current
Premium_ "), the Surviving Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain DandO Insurance in an amount and scope as great as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized
basis) of 300% of the Current Premium; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in
lieu of this coverage, Parent may substitute a prepaid "tail" policy for this
coverage, which it may cause the Company to obtain prior to the Closing.

  

(d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other corporation or entity and is not the continuing or
surviving company or entity of the consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and
in each case, proper provisions will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
7.12.

  



  

64

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.12 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their
heirs and their representatives.

  

7.13 Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties and their Boards of Directors will grant those
approvals and take those actions as are necessary so that these transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise will use reasonable best efforts to act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on these
transactions.

  

7.14 Control of the Companys or Parents Operations. Nothing contained
in this Agreement gives Parent or the Company any rights to control or direct
the operations of the other prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
of its operations.

  

7.15 Section 16(b). The Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent
will, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange
Act to exempt from Section 16 of the Exchange Act (i) the disposition of
Company Shares and "derivative securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under
the Exchange Act) with respect to Company Shares and (ii) the acquisition of
Parent Common Stock and derivative securities with respect to Parent Common
Stock, in each case, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and
directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees or directors of the Company who may
become officers or directors of Parent subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

party, in contract, in tort or otherwise, for any consequential, incidental,
indirect, special, or punitive damages of such other party or Persons
represented by such other party, whether or not the possibility of such

admission by the other party that, under the circumstances, any such remedies

the date that is nine months following the date of such termination, any
Person shall have acquired a majority of the Companys outstanding stock, or a
Company Covered Proposal is consummated or a binding agreement for a

Subsidiaries, then the Company will, immediately upon such acquisition of the
Companys stock or upon consummation of a Company Covered Proposal, pay into a
joint account in the names of Parent and the Asset Purchaser the Company
Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds. The Company acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 9.5(b) are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Asset Purchaser would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly the amount
due pursuant to this Section 9.5(b), and, in order to obtain this payment,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Asset Purchaser commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this Section 9.5(b), the
Company will pay to Parent, Merger Sub and the Asset Purchaser
their respective costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection
with this suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date the payment should have been

other damages to which Parent, Merger Sub or the Asset Purchaser may be
entitled.

  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.4(b)
or by the Company pursuant to Section 9.3(a), then Parent will, immediately
upon termination, pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee, by wire
transfer of same day funds. If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.2(a), 9.2(c) or 9.3(c), (ii) following the date hereof and prior to
such termination, there shall have been made to Parent or its stockholders, or
publicly announced, a bona fide Parent Covered Proposal, and (iii) prior to
the date that is nine months following the date of such termination, any
Person shall have acquired a majority of Parents outstanding stock, or a
Parent Covered Proposal is consummated or a binding agreement

  



  

70

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

for a Parent Covered Proposal is entered into by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, then Parent will, immediately upon such acquisition of Parents
stock or upon consummation of a Parent Covered Proposal, pay the Company the
Parent Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds. Parent
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.5(c) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Parent fails to pay promptly the amount due pursuant to this
Section 9.5(c), and, in order to obtain this payment, the Company commences a
suit which results in a judgment against Parent for the fee set forth in this
Section 9.5(c), Parent will pay to the Company its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with this suit, together
with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date the payment should have been made. Any amounts due under
this Section 9.5(c) shall be in addition to any other damages to which the
Company may be entitled.

10.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Asset Sale Agreement, the
Partnership Interests Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement,
the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, the Asset Purchaser Confidentiality
Agreement, the Letter of Intent, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter and the Asset Purchaser Disclosure Letter, and any other
ancillary documents constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other
prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written
and oral, among Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Asset Purchaser, with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. For greater clarification,
the Asset Sale Agreement and the Partnership Interests Purchase Agreement
contain the terms and conditions upon which the Company and Parent have agreed
to sell, and the Asset Purchaser has agreed to acquire, the utility
properties and partnership interests described in the Asset Sale Agreement and
the Partnership Interests Purchase Agreement and the schedules and exhibits
thereto.

  

10.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than Parent, the Company, Merger
Sub and Asset Purchaser any rights or remedies hereunder, except for the right
of the Company, on behalf of its stockholders, to pursue damages in the event
of Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement which is (i) material and
(ii) willful or knowing, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by
Parent and Merger Sub and except as provided in Section 7.12.

  

10.9 Obligations of Parent, the Company and the Asset Purchaser.
Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action,
such requirement will be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Parent to cause that Subsidiary to take this action. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement will
be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause that
Subsidiary to take this action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Company to cause that Subsidiary to take this action. Whenever
this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Asset Purchaser to take any action,
such requirement will be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Asset
Purchaser to cause such Subsidiary to take this action.

  

10.10 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability, and will not affect the validity or
enforceability or the other provisions hereof in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision will be substituted therefor in order to carry

  



  

75

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the
invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and
the application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances will not,
subject to clause (a), be affected by the invalidity or unenforceability,
except as a result of any substitution, nor will the invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of the provision, or
its application, in any other jurisdiction.

  

10.11 Specific Performance. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and
Asset Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement
would give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and Asset Purchaser
accordingly agrees that, in addition to other remedies, the parties will be
entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by decree of specific
performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary
damages as a remedy and to obtain injunctive relief or other equitable remedy
against any breach or threatened breach hereof.

  

10.12 Assignment. This Agreement is not assignable by operation of law or
otherwise without the prior consent of all the other parties. Any assignment
in contravention of the preceding sentence will be null and void. Subject to
the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

FORM OF AFFILIATE AGREEMENT

  



  

___________, 200[?]

  

Great Plains Energy Incorporated

  

1201 Walnut Street

  

Kansas City, Missouri 64106

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

I have been advised that as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Aquila, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), as
such term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the
Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ").

  

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
February 6, 2007 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to
time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among the Company, Great Plains Energy
Incorporated, a Missouri corporation (" _Parent_ "), Gregory Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_ ") and Black Hills Corporation, a South Dakota corporation, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). Capitalized terms
used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Merger Agreement.

  

I have been advised that the issuance of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on
a Registration Statement. I have also been advised, however, that since I may
be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Merger Agreement
is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, my ability to sell,
assign or transfer any Parent Common Stock that I receive in exchange for any
Company Shares pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale,
assignment or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
from such registration is available. I understand that such exemptions are
limited and I have obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions
of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to
the sale of such Securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the
Securities Act.

  

I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with Parent that I will not
sell, assign or transfer any shares of Parent Common Stock except (i) pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) by a
sale made in conformity with the volume

  



  

A-1

  



  

598048.58-New York Server 6A - MSW

  

   

EXHIBIT A

  



  

and other limitations of Rule 145 (and otherwise in accordance with Rule 144
under the Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of Parent and if so required at
the time) or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of independent
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as described in a "no-action" or
interpretive letter from the Staff of the Commission reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act. In the
event of a sale of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, I will
supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of
customary sellers and brokers Rule 145 representation letters or as Parent
may otherwise reasonably request.

  

I understand that, except as set forth in the Merger Agreement, Parent is
under no obligation to register the sale, assignment, transfer or other
disposition of the shares of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under
the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available solely as a
result of the Merger.

  

Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part that
I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this
letter, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I
am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

  

This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding between Parent
and me concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement will be
governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York applicable to contracts to be performed wholly in the State
of New York.

  

If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing
below and returning a copy of this letter to the undersigned, at which time
this letter shall become a binding agreement between us.

  

Very truly yours,
