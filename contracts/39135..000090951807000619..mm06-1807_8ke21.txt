Company Subsidiary (collectively, "Excluded Shares") and (ii) Restricted
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with this
Article IV, $15.50 in cash (the per share cash consideration to be issued to
the holders of such Common Shares, the "Merger Consideration").   (b)
Cancellation of Common Shares.   (i) At the Effective Time, each Common
Share converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a)
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time    10     represented any such Common Shares
(each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Article IV.   (ii) Each Excluded Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
any shares described in Section 4.1(a)(i)(B), shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist.   (c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time,
each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.   Section 4.2 Exchange of Certificates for Merger
Consideration.   (a) Paying Agent and Procedures.   (i) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company, as paying agent (the "Paying Agent"). At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or at the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent,
separate and apart from its other funds, cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate Merger Consideration which the holders of record of Certificates
(each a "Holder") are entitled to receive pursuant to this Article IV plus
cash to pay for Options and Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and
Section 4.3(b), respectively (such deposited cash being hereinafter referred
to as the "Merger Fund").   (ii) As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each Holder (other
than a Holder of Certificates representing Excluded Shares, but including
Certificates representing Restricted Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in customary form and which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and which shall
be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the
Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to be received by such Holder pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or
Section 4.3(b), as applicable.   (iii) Each Holder of a Certificate
representing any Common Shares that have been converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or Section 4.3(b)
shall, upon surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed in accordance with the    11     instructions thereto and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, for each Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate, in
the form of a check, to be promptly mailed (or made available for collection
by hand if so elected by the surrendering Holder of a Certificate) and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be marked canceled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices.   (iv) In the event of the surrender of a Certificate that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company under the name of
the Person surrendering such Certificate, the Merger Consideration shall be
paid to such a transferee if such Certificate is presented to the Paying
Agent and such Certificate is duly endorsed or is accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If any Merger
Consideration is to be delivered to a Person whose name is other than that in
which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of such delivery that the Person requesting such
delivery shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required to be paid by reason
of such delivery to a Person whose name is other than that of the Holder of
the Certificate surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (v) The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article IV in
respect of Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Shares
represented thereby.   (b) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers of the Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time thereafter on the records
of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall
be marked canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article IV.   (c)
Termination of Merger Fund. Any portion of the Merger Fund (including any
interest and other income resulting from any investment of the Merger Fund)
that remains unclaimed by the Holders and other eligible Persons
in accordance with this Article IV following six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any Holder who has not previously complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration (without interest) upon due surrender of their
Certificates.     12      (d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.
In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate. Delivery of such affidavit and the posting
of such bond shall be deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the
relevant Common Shares for purposes of this Article IV.   (e) Withholding
Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or other
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of
Common Shares (including Restricted Shares) or Options such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the Common Shares (including
Restricted Shares) or Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.   (f) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any portion of the Merger Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  
(g) Investment of Merger Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Merger Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily
basis; provided that in the case of any losses incurred as a result of
such investments, Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Merger Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parent\'s
obligations under this Article IV. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent.   (h) Adjustments. Without
limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
in the number of outstanding Common Shares (or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Shares) shall occur as a result
of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, merger or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, other than as permitted by Section 7.1, the Merger Consideration
shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such change.     13     
Section 4.3 Treatment of Options and Restricted Shares.   (a) Options.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any Common Shares or Options, each
Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether
vested or unvested) shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive, subject to Section 4.2(e), an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Common Shares subject to such
Option (assuming full vesting of such Option) and (ii) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Common Share
subject to the Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded up
to the nearest cent (the "Option Cash Payment"). As of the Effective Time,
all Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist and each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment.   (b)
Restricted Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any restricted
shares, including restricted shares that are converted from Restricted Stock
Units into restricted shares at the Effective Time (each, a "Restricted
Share"), each Restricted Share (whether vested or unvested) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of all
restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be canceled,
retired and shall cease to exist and the Certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Restricted Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive, in respect of each underlying Common Share, the Merger
Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of such Certificate
in accordance with this Article IV.   (c) Paying Agent. Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the Paying Agent with a
list of all holders of Options certified by an officer of the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Corporation\'s transfer agent. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of Options a letter of transmittal (which shall
be in customary form) and instructions for use in obtaining the value of such
Options as contemplated by Section 4.3(a). All payments with respect to
canceled Options shall be made by the Paying Agent (and Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to make such payments) as promptly as practicable after the
receipt by the Paying Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions from
funds deposited by or at the direction of Parent (in order to pay such
amounts) in accordance with Section 4.2(a).       14    ARTICLE
V   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY    Except (i) as
otherwise disclosed to Parent in a letter (the "Company Disclosure Letter")
delivered to it by the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement, it
being understood and agreed that each item in a particular section of the
Company Disclosure Letter applies only to such section and to any other
section to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure, and (ii) other than with respect to Section 5.3, as disclosed in
the Company Reports publicly available prior to the date hereof (the "Filed
Company Reports") and only as and to the extent disclosed therein (other than
any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosures in any
section relating to forward looking statements and any other disclosures
included therein to the extent they are primarily predictive or forward-
looking in nature), it being understood and agreed that each such disclosure
in the Filed Company Reports applies only to such sections of this Article V
to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure,
the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:  
Section 5.1 Corporate Status. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as is now being
conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as is now being conducted
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed and in good standing does not have and would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available
to Parent or Merger Sub complete and correct copies of its Constituent
Documents, as amended and in effect on the date hereof. The Company is not in
material violation of any of the provisions of its Constituent Documents.  
Section 5.2 Company Subsidiaries.   (a) Section 5.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth the name of each Subsidiary owned (whether
directly or indirectly) by the Company (collectively, the "Company
Subsidiaries") and the state or jurisdiction of its organization. Each
Company Subsidiary is a corporation, limited liability company or
partnership, as the case may be, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
or organization, as the case may be, and has all requisite corporate,
limited liability company or partnership power and authority, as the case may
be, to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as
is now being conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be    15     so licensed, qualified and in good
standing has not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has delivered or made available to Parent or Merger Sub complete and correct
copies of the Constituent Documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries, as
amended and in effect on the date hereof.   (b) The Company is, directly or
indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock or other equity interests of each of the Company
Subsidiaries. All of such shares and other equity interests so owned by the
Company are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned free
and clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.   (c)
Other than shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Company
Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any shares
of capital stock or other equity interests in any entity.   Section 5.3
Capitalization.   (a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of Fifty Million (50,000,000) Common Shares and One
Million (1,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share
("Preferred Stock") of which 15,000 shares are designated as Series A Junior

Company Disclosure Letter, including 60,000 Common Shares issuable pursuant
to (A) restricted stock units held by the Company\'s directors and (B) those
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements issued to certain officers of the
Company listed on Section 5.3(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (collectively, the "Restricted Stock Units"). Except as set forth
above, at the close of business on June 11, 2007, no shares of capital stock
of the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All issued
and outstanding Common Shares have been, and all shares which may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of Options or pursuant to the Company\'s stock plans
listed on Section 5.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter will be (when
issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof), duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. From the close of business on
June 11, 2007 until the date of this Agreement, no options to purchase shares
of Common Shares or Preferred Stock have been granted and no Common Shares or
Preferred Stock have been issued, except pursuant to the exercise of Options
in accordance with their terms.   (b) There are no preemptive or similar
rights granted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary on the part of any
holders of any class of securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other    16     obligations the holders of which
have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company or
any such Company Subsidiary on any matter ("Voting Company Debt"). Except as
set forth above or as listed on Section 5.3(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are not, as of the date hereof, any options, warrants, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, commitments, contracts,
arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound (i)
obligating the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue, deliver
or sell or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, or any security
convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock of, or
other equity interest in, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Voting
Company Debt, (ii) obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue,

derived from the economic benefits and rights accruing to holders of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. As of the date hereof, there are not any outstanding obligations
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or to provide funds to or make any investment in (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any Person. There are
no proxies, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or is bound with
respect to the voting of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.   Section 5.4 Authority for
Agreements.   (a) The Company has the corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary for it to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, except for approval of this Agreement (the
"Company Stockholder Approval") by the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote in accordance with the MBCA (the
"Requisite Stockholder Vote"). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws effecting or relating to
enforcement of creditors\' rights generally or by general principles of
equity.   (b) The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are    17     advisable and fair to, and in the best interests
of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted and declared advisable
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, (iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Company\'s
stockholders for their approval and (iv) resolved to recommend that the
Company\'s stockholders approve this Agreement (collectively, the
"Recommendation").   Section 5.5 Consents and Approvals; No Violations.  
(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements do not and will not require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Entity, except for (i) the pre-merger notification
requirements under the HSR Act, (ii) the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, (iii) the filing of the Articles of Merger pursuant to the MBCA
(the requirements in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the
"Governmental Requirements") and (iv) any such consent, approval,
authorization, permit, filing, or notification, the failure of which to make
or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to (A) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) prevent or materially
delay consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform
its obligations hereunder and the other transaction contemplated hereby.  
(b) Except for the Requisite Stockholder Vote, as set forth in Section 5.5(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter or as contemplated by Section 5.5(a), no
consent or approval of any other Person is required to be obtained by the
Company for the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by
the Company and consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, except where the failure to obtain any such
consent or approval would not reasonably be expected to (A) have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or (B) prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise materially
adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
hereunder and the other transaction contemplated hereby.   (c) None of the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company or,
subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Vote, consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or
compliance by the Company with any provisions hereof, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements, will (i)
violate any provision of the Constituent Documents of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (ii) result in a violation or breach of any provision of,
or constitute (with or without the giving of due notice or the lapse of time
or both) a default under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, payment, acceleration or revocation, or result in the loss of
any benefits by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, under, any agreement,
undertaking, commitment or obligation to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any of their respective assets may be bound, (iii) result in the creation
or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any property or asset of the Company or
any    18     Company Subsidiary or (iv) violate or conflict with any
Applicable Law to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary, is subject,
except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, payments, accelerations,
revocations, creations, impositions or conflicts which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, (A) have or be reasonably expected to have,
a Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) be reasonably expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby or otherwise materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations hereunder and the other transaction contemplated
hereby.   (d) The Company has taken all action necessary to render
the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the execution of this Agreement and
the Stockholders Agreements and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Merger, such that none of the execution of
this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreements, and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, will
result in the grant of any rights to any person under the Rights Plan or
enable or require any rights outstanding thereunder to be exercised,
distributed or triggered.   (e) Takeover Statutes. The provisions of
Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 110D do not apply to the Company, the
Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company Board has taken all actions
necessary such that the restrictions contained in Massachusetts General Laws
Chapter 110C and 110F do not apply to the Merger, this Agreement, the
Stockholders Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;
provided, that, for purposes hereof, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
specifically represent and warrant to the Company that neither of them is an
"interested stockholder" in the Company, as such term is defined in
Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 110F. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no other "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"business combination", "control share acquisition" statute or other similar
statute or regulation that applies to the Merger, this Agreement, the
Stockholders Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.   Section 5.6 Company Financial Statements; SEC Reports.   (a)
The Company Financial Statements have been derived from the accounting books
and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
presented, subject, in the case of interim unaudited Company Financial
Statements, only to normal, recurring year-end adjustments, and comply in all
material respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC. The consolidated balance
sheets included in the Company Financial Statements present fairly in all
material respects the financial position of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated
statements of income, consolidated statements of shareholders\' equity and
consolidated statements of cash flows included in such Company Financial
Statements present fairly in all    19     material respects the
results of operations, shareholders\' equity and cash flows of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for the respective periods indicated. All of the
Company Subsidiaries are consolidated for accounting purposes.   (b) The
term "Company Financial Statements" means the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries included in
the Company Reports together, in the case of year-end statements, with
reports thereon by Ernst and Young LLP, the independent auditors of the
Company, including in each case a consolidated balance sheet, a consolidated
statement of income, a consolidated statement of stockholders\' equity and a
consolidated statement of cash flows, and accompanying notes.   (c) The
Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed or furnished, as
applicable, all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by it to the SEC since January 1, 2005 (the
"Company Reports"). As of its respective date, each Company Report complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company Report, and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to any Company Report. No Company Subsidiary is required to file any
form, report or other document with the SEC.   (d) Each of the then-acting
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Company has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company Reports.   (e) Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder, the Company has been and is in compliance in
all material respects with the applicable provisions thereunder.   (f) The
Company has implemented and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting that is designed to ensure (i) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Company Financial
Statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for the
Company consolidated assets, (ii) that transactions, receipts
and expenditures are executed only in accordance with the authorization
of management, (iii) access to the Company\'s assets is permitted only
with management\'s authorization and the prevention or timely detection of
the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\'s assets
that could materially affect the Company Financial Statements and (iv)
accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately
and collected on a current and timely basis. The Company\'s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have disclosed, based on
their most recent evaluation, to the Company\'s outside auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the    20     design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably expected to adversely affect the
Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data
and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Company\'s internal
control over financial reporting   (g) The Company\'s "disclosure controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) are reasonably designed in all material respects to ensure that
(i) information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and to make the certifications of
the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.  
Section 5.7 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth on Section 5.7 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, since December 31, 2006, (a) there has been no
event, occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect
which, individually or in the aggregate, (i) has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or the

including Merger, except where the failure to obtain any such consent
or approval would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Subject to
compliance with the Governmental Requirements, none of the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, nor
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with

Documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) result in a violation or breach of
any provision of, or constitute (with or without the giving of due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise to any right of

agreement, undertaking, commitment or obligation to which Parent or Merger
Sub is a party or by which    34     any of them or any of their
properties or assets may be bound, (iii) result in the creation or imposition

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 6.4 Information in Proxy Statement. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, at the date such
Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, and at the
time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.   Section 6.5

any arbitrator) pending or threatened against or affecting Parent or any of
its Affiliates, the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would

Commitment has not been withdrawn or rescinded. The Financing Commitment is
in full force and effect. The Financing Commitment, in the form so delivered,
is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by
the Financing Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Financing Commitment, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitment
will be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
other      35     transactions contemplated hereby. Parent does not
have any Knowledge that any event has occurred which, with or without the
giving of due notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Financing
Commitment. Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied
by it and contained in the Financing Commitment. For avoidance of doubt, it
shall not be a condition to Closing for Parent to obtain the Financing or any
alternative financing.   Section 6.8 Ownership of Common Shares. Neither

business within the Company\'s principal lines of business.   Section 6.10

faith (i) after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and the Company\'s outside legal advisor, that such
Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside counsel,
that the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below
with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the holders of the Common Shares
under Applicable Law, the Company may in response to such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, subject compliance with Section 8.4(d), and after
giving Parent written notice of such action, (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no more favorable to such
person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, including in
respect to any standstill provisions; provided that a copy of all such
information not previously provided to Parent (or its Representatives) is
promptly provided to Parent, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Alternative Transaction Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such Alternative Transaction Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8.4(a) shall prohibit
the Company from contacting and engaging in discussions with any Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal
solely for the purpose of clarifying such Alternative Transaction Proposal
and any material terms, and the conditions to consummation, thereof so as to
determine whether it could be reasonably expected for such Alternative
Transaction Proposal to lead to a Superior Proposal.   (b) Neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i)
withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) or publicly
propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
Recommendation (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as
an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) recommend, adopt or approve, or
propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Transaction
Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement,
joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement,
arrangement or understanding (A) relating to any Alternative Transaction
Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon, delay, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; provided that in the case of clause (iii), that the Company shall
not be prohibited from entering into a confidentiality agreement pursuant to
Section 8.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
holders of the Common Shares under Applicable Law; provided that the Company
Board may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change unless (i) the Company
Board shall have first provided three (3) Business Days   
43     prior written notice to Parent (an "Adverse Recommendation Change
Notice") that it is prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change,
which notice shall contain, with reasonable detail, the facts and conclusions
that led the Company Board to conclude that the failure to take such action
could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Company\'s stockholders under Applicable Law (it being understood and
agreed that any material change to such facts and conclusions shall require a
new Adverse Recommendation Change Notice and a new three (3) Business Day
notice period) and (ii) in making a determination to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Board shall have taken into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice or otherwise). No Adverse Recommendation Change
shall change the approval of the Board for purposes of causing any state
takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company or the Company Board shall be
permitted to comply with Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, including by taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside
counsel), failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under Applicable Law.   (d) In addition to the obligations of the Company
listed in Section 8.4(a) and Section 8.4(b), the Company shall promptly (and,
in any event, within 24 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the
identity of the Person making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal and
of any discussions, explorations or negotiations sought to be entered into or
continued by such Person with the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or Representatives. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any
change to the terms and conditions thereof) of any such Alternative
Transaction Proposal.   Section 8.5 Filings; Other Action. Subject to the
terms and conditions herein provided the Company and Parent shall (a)
promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, make all filings and submissions required under the HSR Act with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and use
best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act, (b) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
each other in (i) determining which filings are required to be made prior to
the Effective Time with, and which material consents, approvals, permits,
notices or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Effective
Time from, Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and related agreements and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii) promptly making all
such filings and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits,
notices or authorizations, and (c) use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions   
44     contemplated hereby, including the Merger, as soon as practicable,
including using best efforts to take all such further action as may be
necessary (A) to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Entity
may assert under any Applicable Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (B) to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Applicable Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable and in any event no later than the Outside Date; provided, that
Parent shall not be required to consent to the divestiture or other
disposition of any of its or its Affiliates\' assets, except as would have an
immaterial impact on Parent and its Affiliates taken as a whole, or to
consent to any other structural or conduct remedy and shall have
no obligation to contest, administratively or in court, any ruling, order or
other action of any Governmental Entity respecting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the
Company, on the one hand, will provide Parent, and Parent, on the other hand,
will provide the Company, with copies of material correspondence, filings or
communications (or oral summaries or memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Entity or members of their respective staffs, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.   Section 8.6 Public Announcements; Public Disclosures; Privacy
Laws. Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any
press release or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or
public statement as may be required by Applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange,
will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld).   Section 8.7 Employee Matters.   (a) Until the
twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Effective Time (the "Benefits
Continuation Period"), and subject to the last sentence of this Section
8.7(a), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to provide, for those employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who continue as employees of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries during
the Benefits Continuation Period (the "Company Employees"), (i) at least the
same level of base salary and wages and (ii) employee benefits that are
comparable in the aggregate to those currently provided by the Company or the
applicable Company Subsidiary to such employees pursuant to the Company
Benefit Plans set forth on Section 5.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(excluding any equity or equity-based plans and severance, retention or
change of control plans or agreements). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide, severance and any similar
benefits to Company Employees which are comparable in the aggregate to the
severance and similar benefits currently provided under the Company Benefit
Plans for the Benefit Continuation    45     Period, including by
recognizing all service currently recognized for such purposes under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan.   (b) For purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan) under any benefit plan or arrangement of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective Time
(collectively, the "New Plans"), the employees (including officers) of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall receive service credit for service
with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and any respective
predecessors) to the same extent such service credit was granted under the
Company Benefit Plans, except to the extent any such service credit would
result in the duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction
of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans to the extent
that (A) coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (collectively, the "Old Plans") and (B) such Company
Employee has satisfied all waiting time and other eligibility requirements
under the Old Plan being replaced by the New Plan; and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause (x) all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such
exclusions and requirements were not applicable under the Old Plan and (y)
any expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.   (c)
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms the
employment, severance and termination plans and agreements (including change
in control provisions) with employees or independent contractors of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries set forth in Section 8.7 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.   (d) Nothing in this Section 8.7 or any other
provision of this Agreement shall be construed to modify, amend or establish
any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement or in any way affect the
ability of the parties hereto or any other Person to modify, amend or
terminate any of its employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements. This
Section 8.7 is not intended to, and shall not be construed to, confer upon
any person other than the parties to this Agreement any rights or remedies
hereunder.   Section 8.8 Company Indemnification Provisions.   
46      (a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain the Company\'s existing indemnification provisions as of the date
hereof with respect to present and former directors, officers, employees and
agents of the Company and all other Persons who may presently serve or have
served at the Company\'s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") under (i) Applicable
Law, (ii) the Company\'s Constituent Documents in effect on the date hereof
(to the extent consistent with Applicable Law) and (iii) indemnification
agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in effect on the date
hereof (to the extent consistent with Applicable Law) for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations under such indemnification
provisions in accordance with their respective terms.   (b) Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to purchase a single payment, run-off policy or policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering the Persons currently
covered by the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policies for claims currently covered by the Company\'s
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies arising in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (but only
in respect thereof) in amount and scope at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, as the Company\'s existing policies, such policy or policies to
become effective at the Effective Time and remain in effect for a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that the premium
for such run-off policy or policies shall not exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company to
maintain its existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies
(which amount is disclosed in Section 8.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter); provided, further, that, if such run-off policy or policies cannot
be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate premiums in excess of
three hundred percent (300%) of such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall only be required to obtain as much
coverage as can be obtained by paying a premium equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of such amount.   (c) If Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its or their successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this Section 8.8.    (d) The provisions of
this Section 8.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.     47      Section 8.9 State Takeover Laws. If any
"fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute
or other similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to the
Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement, the
Stockholders Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.   Section 8.10 Solvency Letter. The parties shall engage, at the
expense of the Company (except that, if the Closing does not occur, the
Company and Merger Sub shall share such expense equally), an appraisal firm
of national reputation reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company to
deliver a letter in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company Board and
addressed to the Company Board and the board of directors of Parent and, if
requested by them, the lenders providing any financing to Parent, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation indicating that, immediately after the Effective
Time, and after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including any financing contemplated by Parent and the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and all related fees and
expenses, the Company will be Solvent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to (a) make available to such appraisal firm their
respective officers, employees and advisors upon reasonable notice and (b)
provide or make available such information concerning the business,
properties, assets and liabilities of the Company, in each case as may be
reasonably requested by such appraisal firm in connection with the delivering
of such letter.   Section 8.11 Financing. The Company shall and shall cause
its subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and Representatives

Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with any financing contemplated
by Parent (including the Financing or any alternative financing), including
(i) participation in meetings, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
materials required in connection with any such financing, (iii) executing and
delivering definitive financing documentation (including pledge and security
documents); provided that no obligation of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries under any such document, agreement or pledge shall be effective
until the Effective Time; (iv) furnishing Parent and its financing sources,
as promptly as practicable, with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent; and (v)
taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective
Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of any such
financing; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have
any liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related document
or any other agreement or document related to any financing unless and until
the Closing has occurred.       48      Section 8.12 Rule 16b-3.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause

pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   Section 8.13 Control
of Operations. Without in any way limiting any party\'s rights or obligations
under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (i) nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company\'s operations prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.   Section 8.14
Additional Matters. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each
of the parties agrees to use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including using all
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents
and approvals in connection with the Governmental Requirements and any other
third party consents and to effect all necessary registrations and filings.
In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation shall take all such necessary action.  
Section 8.15 Debt Offer. At such time as requested by Parent, the Company
shall (i) commence a cash tender offer (the "Debt Offer") to purchase any and
all of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes of the Company due 2012 (the "Senior Notes")
and (ii) solicit the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes regarding
certain amendments (the "Indenture Amendments") to the covenants contained in
the Indenture, dated as of March 8, 2004, by and between the Company and the
Bank of New York, as trustee. Such offer to purchase and consent solicitation
shall be made in accordance with the written terms and conditions provided,
from time to time, by Parent to the Company and Applicable Law; provided that
in any event, the parties agree that the terms and conditions of the Debt
Offer and Indenture Amendments shall provide that the closing
and effectiveness, respectively, thereof shall be contingent upon the Closing
of the Merger. The Company shall not, without Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s
prior consent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer described in the written
terms and conditions provided by Parent to the Company from time to time. In
the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(a),

Company), Section 10.1(e) or Section 10.1(f), Parent shall reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the
Company that are directly related to the Debt Offer (including, any
reasonable and customary fees and expenses paid by the Company to any dealer
manager, information agent, depository or other agent retained in connection
with the Debt Offer) (the "Debt Tender Fees"); provided, however, (A) the
Company shall be required to return to Parent any Debt Tender Fees previously
paid by Parent to the Company if the    49     Company subsequently
uses the materials prepared for the Debt Offer and (B) in the event that
Parent has reimbursed the Company for the Debt Tender Fees and the Company
subsequently becomes obligated to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee or
to reimburse Parent for its Expenses, the Company shall also be required to
return to Parent any Debt Tender Fees previously paid by Parent to
the Company and such return of the Debt Tender Fees shall not be deemed to be
Parent Expenses for the purposes of Section 10.3. The Company shall not enter
into any arrangements in connection with the Debt Offer (including any
engagement or similar agreements with any dealer manager, information agent,
depository or other agent) without the prior written consent of Parent.  
Section 8.16 Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, the Company

as of such specified date), interpreted without giving effect to the words
"materially" or "material" or to any qualifications based on such terms or

this Agreement required to be performed by it at or prior to the Effective
Time); provided, that the Outside Date may be extended for a period not to
exceed forty-five (45) days by either party by written notice to the other

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or

pursuant to Section 10.1(h), simultaneously with such termination by wire
transfer of same day funds; provided that the provisions of this
Section 10.3(a) shall be subject to Section 10.3(e).     53      (b)
In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 10.1(b), Section 10.1(d) or by Parent pursuant to Section
10.1(g), and (A) if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or
Section 10.1(g)) or prior to the taking of a vote to adopt this Agreement at
the Company Stockholders\' Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof
(in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.1(d)), an Alternative
Transaction Proposal shall have been made or communicated to the Company or
shall have been publicly announced or publicly made known to the stockholders
of the Company and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the
Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
shall have consummated, an Alternative Transaction Proposal, then, in any
such event, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, such
payment to be made upon the earlier of the Company entering into an agreement
providing for, or consummating, such Alternative Transaction Proposal, by
wire transfer of same day funds; provided that the provisions of this
Section 10.3(c) shall be subject to Section 10.3(e).   (c) In the event
that the conditions set forth in Section 9.1 and Section 9.3 have been
satisfied (unless the failure to satisfy any such conditions is due to the
failure by Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy their respective obligations set
forth therein) and, in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 10.1(f) as a result of the breach by Parent of
its obligation under Sections 2.2 and 2.3 to consummate the Merger, Parent
shall pay a fee equal to $5,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") to the
Company or as directed by the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination),
payable by wire transfer of same day funds; provided that the provisions of
this Section 10.3(c) shall be subject to Section 10.3(e).   (d) Each of the
Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
10.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that the Company shall
fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due or Parent shall fail to pay
the Parent Termination Fee when due, and in order to obtain such payment, the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, commences a suit which results in a
judgment against such other party for such fee, then the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, shall pay to the other party such other party\'s
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses of enforcement) in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the amounts owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as
published in The Wall Street Journal, plus two percent (2%) per annum from
the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually
received by such party. Each party acknowledges that in the event it receives
the Parent Termination Fee (in the case of the Company) or the Company
Termination Fee (in the case of Parent), as the case may be, such
Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee, as the case may be, (plus
any additional amounts pursuant to the second sentence of this Section
10.3(c) or payable pursuant to Section 10.3(e)) shall constitute such
party\'s sole and exclusive remedy for, and such amount shall constitute
liquidated damages in respect of, the breach or termination of this Agreement
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such breach or termination and
such party shall    54     have no further rights, directly or
indirectly, against any other party hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members, directors, officers and agents
or against any party to the Financing Commitment, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise.   (e) Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, each party shall bear its own Expenses in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except that in the
event this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section 10.1(d) or Section
10.1(g) in addition to any payments it may be required to make to Parent in
respect of such termination, promptly following such termination the Company,
shall reimburse Parent for all of Parent\'s Expenses in an amount not to
exceed $4,000,000; provided, however, if a Company Termination Fee is
subsequently payable to Parent, the Company Termination Fee shall equal the
lesser of (A) $5,000,000 and (B) $6,500,000 minus the amount of Parent
Expenses previously reimbursed to the Company pursuant to this Section
10.3(e), (ii) pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or Section 10.1(h), in addition to
any payments it may be required to make to Parent in respect of such
termination, the Company shall promptly reimburse Parent for all of Parent\'s
Expenses in an amount not to exceed $1,500,000 and (iii) pursuant to Section
10.1(b) and Parent subsequently becomes entitled to receive the
Company Termination Fee, in addition to any payments it may be required to
make to Parent in respect of such termination, promptly following the time
that Parent becomes entitles to receive the Company Termination Fee the
Company shall reimburse Parent for all of Parent\'s Expenses in an amount not
to exceed $1,500,000. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" includes all
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and
consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates) actually incurred by a
party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation, printing, filing
and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of stockholder
approvals and all other matters related to the transactions contemplated
