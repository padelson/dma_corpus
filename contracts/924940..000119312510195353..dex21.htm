ARTICLE 2

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware
Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place,
at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree.

 

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as may be agreed upon by the Company and Parent and specified in
the certificate of merger).

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges, properties and franchises and be
subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities
of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.



 

10 Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c), Section
2.04 or Section 2.05, each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive $12.50 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), payable
to the holder of such share of Company Stock, upon surrender in accordance
with Section 2.03. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03,
without interest.

 

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
such number of validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable shares of stock
of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same
percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned
in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except for any such shares
resulting from the conversion of shares of Company Stock pursuant to Section
2.02(c)).

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint a nationally recognized agent (the "Exchange
Agent"), which Exchange Agent shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares").
Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Exchange Agent, in trust, sufficient funds for the
timely payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders
of Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in respect of
the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (the



 

11  "Exchange Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company
Stock at the Effective Time whose Company Stock was converted into the right
to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02 a letter of
transmittal and instructions, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Company and Parent prior to the Closing (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent), for use in such exchange.

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to promptly
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for
each such share of Company Stock represented by a Certificate or for
each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case
may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after
the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be canceled
and cease to exist.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated
Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required
as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock six
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such 



 

12  shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares
of Company Stock without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority)
shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration held in the Exchange Fund for
which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand.

(g) The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings on the Exchange Fund shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
Notwithstanding anything otherwise provided herein, no investment of the
Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent from making the payments required by this Article 2, and following any
net losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of
Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of such
net losses, which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Exchange
Fund. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities that could
prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Stock
("Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law shall
not be converted into or otherwise represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
receive from the Company such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal,
such shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the

 



 

13  Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.05. _Stock Options_ , _Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock
and Restricted Stock Units_. (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each then outstanding Company Stock Option and Company SAR that is then
vested shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay to the holder of such
award at or promptly after the Effective Time the amount, if any, determined
by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such award by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Stock covered by such award; _it being understood_ that any such
award that has an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled without any consideration to the holder of
such award.

 

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding
Company Stock Option and Company SAR that is then unvested and each Company
RSU shall be canceled, and each share of Company Restricted Stock shall be
surrendered, and the Company shall pay to the holder of such award an amount
(the "Retention Amount"), if any, determined as follows: (i) for each Company
Stock Option or Company SAR, such amount, if any, shall be determined by
multiplying (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such award by (B) the number of shares of
Company Stock covered by such award; _it being understood_ that any such award
that has an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled without any consideration to the holder of
such award; (ii) for each Company RSU, such amount shall be determined by
multiplying (A) the Merger Consideration by (B) the number of shares of
Company Stock covered by such award; and (iii) for each share of Company
Restricted Stock, such amount shall equal the Merger Consideration. The
aggregate amount of the Retention Amounts that is payable to a Continuing
Partner shall be paid one-third on April 1, 2011 and two-thirds on April 1,
2012, in each case subject to such Continuing Partners remaining a partner
of Parent, Parent UK or Parent India through such date; _provided_ , _however_
, that any unpaid portion of such aggregate Retention Amount shall be paid to
such partner upon his or her ceasing to be a partner due to such
circumstances as are specified in the offer letter entered into between such
Continuing Partner and Parent, Parent UK or Parent India prior to the date
hereof. The aggregate amount of the Retention Amount that is payable to a
Continuing Employee shall be paid to such Continuing Employee on April 1,
2011, subject to such employees remaining employed with Parent, Parent UK,
Parent India or any of their respective Affiliates through such date; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that such



 

14  aggregate amount shall be paid to such Continuing Employee upon the
termination of his or her employment prior to such date due to his or her
death or Disability or upon specified terminations of employment as described
in Section 7.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. "Disability" means any
medically determinable physical or mental impairment that prevents a
Continuing Employee from engaging in any substantial gainful activity and
that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected
to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Parent reasonably determines that paying any portion of the
Retention Amount in respect of a canceled Company RSU that is subject to
Section 409A of the Code on the date specified in this Section 2.05(b) could
cause the holder of such award to incur additional taxes or interest
under Section 409A of the Code, such portion shall be paid to such holder on
the date nearest such specified date that Parent reasonably determines such
portion could be paid without causing such holder to incur such additional
taxes or interest. Following the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
Parent shall cause the Company to, comply with its severance obligations for
operations employees as described in Section 7.04(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as
are reasonably necessary to approve and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by Section 2.05(a) and Section 2.05(b). All amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and Section 2.05(b) shall be subject to any
applicable withholding.

 

Section 2.06. _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to provide that with respect to the Company
ESPP: (a) participants may not increase their payroll deduction percentages or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (b) no
purchase period or offering period shall commence under the Company ESPP
following the date of this Agreement; (c) each participants outstanding right
to purchase shares of Company Stock under the Company ESPP shall be suspended
immediately following the end of the purchase period in effect on the date
of this Agreement or, if earlier, the end of the Business Day immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, in either case, all amounts
allocated to each participants account under the Company ESPP as of such date
shall thereupon be used to purchase immediately prior to the Effective Time
from the Company whole shares of Company Stock at the applicable price under
the Company ESPP for the then outstanding purchase period; (d) as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the purchase of shares of Company Stock in
accordance with the preceding clause (c), return to participants the funds, if
any, that remain in the participants accounts after such purchase; and (e)
the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time so
that no further purchase rights shall be granted or exercised under the
Company ESPP thereafter.



 

15 Section 2.07. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
(including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares of Company Stock, or any
stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding
any change that results from (i) any exercise of Company Stock Options or
Company SARs or any settlement of Company RSUs, in each case, that are
outstanding as of the date hereof or (ii) any purchase of shares of Company
Stock under the Company ESPP), the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.08. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Stock in respect of which
the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.09. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals the absence of which would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent
true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as currently in effect.

Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization_. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the approval of the Companys stockholders in
connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock
is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger (the "Company
Stockholder Approval"). Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, this Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization,

 



 

17  moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general
principles of equity).

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors (the
"Board of Directors") has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of
the Companys stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved, adopted and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)
unanimously resolved, subject to Section 6.04(b), to recommend adoption of
this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board
Recommendation").

respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (a) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with
the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business,
(b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, (c) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other
applicable state or federal securities laws and (d) any actions or filings the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Section 4.04. _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (b) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (c) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, require any consent
or other action by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that,

Company SARs and Company Stock Options in connection with the treatment of
such awards under Section 2.05 of this Agreement) cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license,
franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization
affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any 



 

18  Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such
exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b) through (d), as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

Section 4.05. _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Stock and 2,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, $1.00 par value per share. As of August 20, 2010, there

(c) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders
of the Company may vote. Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for
changes since August 16, 2010 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock
Options or Company SARs, the settlement of Company RSUs outstanding on such
date or the purchase of Company Stock under the Company ESPP pursuant to an
election in effect on such date, there are no issued or outstanding (i)

in the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or

performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar
securities or rights that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits
based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or
voting securities of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iv) being
referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement
with respect to the voting of any Company Securities.

duly organized, is validly existing and (where applicable) in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, has all organizational
powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents
and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of
which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each such Subsidiary is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. All material Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective
jurisdictions of organization are identified in the Company 10-K.

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other

Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company

does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other voting
securities of or ownership interests in any Person.

any exhibits and schedules thereto and other information incorporated
therein, the "Company SEC Documents").

(b) As of its filing date (and as of the date of any amendment), each Company
SEC Document complied, as to form in all material respects with the applicable

the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or

weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of
any such disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors and audit
committee since January 1, 2007.

 

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in

Section 4.09. _Disclosure Documents_. The proxy statement of the Company to
be filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement")
will, when filed, comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the 1934 Act. At the time the Proxy Statement and
any amendments or supplements thereto is first mailed to the stockholders of
the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Proxy
Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this Section

and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules

or 5000 of the Code.

or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Employee Plan or otherwise. There is no contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively,
would entitle any employee or former employee to any severance or
other payment solely as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, or

termination (whether by the Company or the officer).

retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries except
as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code or applicable
state continuation coverage.

(f) Except for any actions required to comply with the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act of 2010 (including any such actions that the Company
reasonably determines are desirable to take in advance of the applicable
compliance deadline) there has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates



 

28  relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, an
Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such
Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding with a

that are due have been made with respect to each Employee Plan within the time
periods prescribed by the terms of such Employee Plan and Applicable Law, and
all contributions and payments for any period ending on or before
the Effective Time that are not due are properly accrued to the extent
required to be accrued under Applicable Law.

(i) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

(j) The Company has provided Parent with a list and copies of each
International Plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
each International Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and
with the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders,
rules and regulations (including any special provisions relating to qualified
plans where such International Plan was intended so to qualify) and has been
maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. There has
been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or
not written) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change
in employee participation or coverage under, any International Plan that
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such International Plan
above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent
fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof. According to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used for the purpose of funding each
International Plan (or, if the same has no such assumptions and valuations or
is unfunded, according to actuarial assumptions and valuations in use by
the PBGC on the date hereof), as of the Company Balance Sheet Date, the total
amount or value of the funds available under such Plan to pay benefits accrued
thereunder or segregated in respect of such accrued benefits, together with
any reserve or accrual with respect thereto,



 

29  exceeded the present value of all benefits (actual or contingent) accrued as
of such date of all participants and past participants therein in respect of
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or would have after the
Effective Time any obligation. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and
its Affiliates will get the full benefit of any such funds, accruals or
reserves.

 

(k) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" and
any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code, has been operated in substantial compliance with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code.

citation, summons or order has been received, no complaint has been filed, no
penalty has been assessed, and no investigation, action, claim, suit,

threatened by any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and relating to or arising out of
any Environmental Law; (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are and have
been since January 1, 2007 in compliance with all Environmental Laws and all
Environmental Permits; and (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, there is
no condition, situation or set of circumstances that would reasonably be
expected to result in or be the basis for any liability or obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising under or relating to any
Environmental Law or any Hazardous Substance.

(b) There has been no environmental investigation study, audit, test, review
or other analysis conducted of which the Company has knowledge in relation to
the current or prior business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
property or facility now or previously owned or leased by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that is in the possession of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that has not been made available to Parent at least five Business
Days prior to the date hereof.

filing or other action under any environmental transfer statute, including,
without limitation, the Connecticut Hazardous Waste Establishment Transfer Act
and the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act.

 

(d) For purposes of this Section 4.18, the terms "Company" and "Subsidiaries"
shall include any entity that is, in whole or in part, a predecessor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

or in any geographic region, (B) engage in any line of business or (C)

cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled thereunder.

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,

Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Merger Subsidiary has heretofore made

incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect. Since the date of its
incorporation, Merger Subsidiary has not engaged in any activities other than

performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby are within the partnership powers of Parent and the corporate powers
of



 

33  Merger Subsidiary, respectively, and have been duly authorized by all
necessary partnership action, in the case of Parent, and all necessary
corporate action, in the case of Merger Subsidiary. Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, enforceable against Parent and Merger Subsidiary in accordance
with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors
rights generally and general principles of equity).

 

Section 5.04. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the

hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority, other than (a) the filing of a certificate of merger with respect
to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which Parent is qualified to
do business, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR
Act, (c) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the
1934 Act and any other state or federal securities laws and (d) any actions or
filings the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Section 5.05. _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of
any provision of the partnership agreement of Parent or certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Merger Subsidiary, respectively, (b) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.04, contravene, conflict
with, or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable
Law or (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.04,
require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default,
or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation,
acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any
provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or
other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets
or business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b)
through (d), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.



 

34 Section 5.06. _Disclosure Documents_. The information supplied by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at the time
the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto is first mailed
to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder
Approval, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this
Section 5.06 will not apply to statements or omissions included or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based upon information
supplied by the Company or any of its representatives or
advisors specifically for use or incorporation by reference therein.

Section 5.07. _Finders  Fees_. Except for Perella Weinberg Partners LP,
whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act
on behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.08. _Financing_. The obligations of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
hereunder are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents, Merger
Subsidiarys or an other Persons ability to obtain financing necessary to
consummate the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Parent has,
and will have as of the Effective Time, sufficient cash, available lines of
credit or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to
consummate the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including to
pay the Merger Consideration for all of the shares of Company Stock on a
fully-diluted basis and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 5.09. _Share Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary has
been, at any time during the three years preceding the date hereof, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company, as defined in Section 203 of Delaware
Law. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary does not own (directly or
indirectly, beneficially or of record) and is not a party to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of the Company other
than as contemplated by this Agreement.

request and (c) instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors
and other representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate
with Parent in its investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to provide access to any information or documents which
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) breach any agreement of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary with any Third Party, (ii) constitute a
waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) which would result in a competitor of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary receiving material information which is
competitively sensitive. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this Section
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.03 or in the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall be permitted to
provide information and documents provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries
to Parents counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other representatives
(including consultants) for the



 

39  purposes of implementing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
evaluating or implementing any post-Closing restructuring involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.04. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_. (a) General Prohibition _s_.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
or other agents or advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage
the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) other than informing persons
of the provisions contained in this Section 6.04, enter into or participate
in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party
that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to
make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or take any action or
make any statement inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation) (any of
the foregoing in this clause (iii), a "Change in Recommendation"), (iv) grant
any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect
to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(v) approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law or (vi) enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating
to an Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section by
the Company.

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), at any time prior to the
Company obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval:

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party and its Representatives that, subject to the Companys compliance with
Section 6.04(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_ ,
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors in good faith
believes is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal
and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with such Third Party



 

40  with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that all such information (to the extent
that such information has not been previously provided or made available to
Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party; and

 

(ii) following receipt of a Superior Proposal or in response to an Intervening
Event that shall have occurred and be continuing, the Board of Directors may
make a Change in Recommendation and, solely in the case of a Superior
Proposal, terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(i);

 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event,
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Delaware Law.

 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal or publicly disclosing the existence of any Acquisition
Proposal to the extent required by Applicable Law, in each case, so long as
any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with
this Section 6.04. In addition, it is understood and agreed that for purposes
of this Section 6.04, a factually accurate public statement by the Company
that only describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains a "stop-look-
and-listen communication" shall not be deemed a Change in Recommendation.

 

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions
referred to in Section 6.04(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day) after receipt by the Company (or any of
its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any _bona fide_ indication
that a Third Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party who would reasonably be
expected to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party
making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and shall promptly (but in no



 

41  event later than one Business Day after receipt) provide to Parent copies of
all correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that describes any material terms or conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any oral
communications addressing such matters). Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of the Companys compliance with this Section 6.04(c).

(d) Change in Recommendation.

 

(i) The Board of Directors shall not make a Change in Recommendation in
response to an Acquisition Proposal (or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at
least 48 hours (but in no event less than one Business Day) before taking
that action, of its intention to do so and attaching the most current version
of the proposed agreement, to the extent available, under which such Superior
Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third
party making the Acquisition Proposal, (iii) if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent during such period to
enable Parent to propose changes to the terms of this Agreement that would
cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and
(iv) the Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel) any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
written notification from the Company and a new period under this Section
6.04(d)(i)).

(ii) Further, the Board of Directors shall not make a Change in
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event, unless (i) the Company
promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least 48 hours (but in no event less
than one Business Day) before taking that action, of its intention to do so
and its basis and rationale for proposing to take such action, (ii) if
requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent during such period to enable Parent to propose changes to the terms of
this Agreement that would obviate the need for the Board of Directors to take
such action and (iii) the Board of Directors shall have considered in good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) any changes to this Agreement proposed
in writing by Parent (it being understood and agreed that any material change
to the facts and circumstances relating to such

 



 

42  Intervening Event shall require a new written notification from the Company
and a new period under this Section 6.04(d)(ii)).

 

(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for
at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors determines in good faith
after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel after taking into account all the terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, is more
favorable to the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders)
than as provided hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.04(d)(i)), which the
Board of Directors determines is reasonably likely to be consummated.

 

(f) Definition of Intervening Event. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Intervening Event" means a material development or change in material
circumstances (other than an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal)
occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement, that was neither known
to the Board of Directors as of the date hereof nor reasonably foreseeable
by the Board of Directors as of or prior to the date hereof, which becomes
known to the Board of Directors prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that no development or change in
circumstances shall constitute an Intervening Event if such development or
change in circumstances resulted from or arose out of the announcement,
pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

ARTICLE 7

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

Parent agrees that:



 

43 Section 7.01. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.02. _Voting of Company Shares_. Parent shall vote all shares of
Company Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

Section 7.03. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

 

(a) From the Effective Time and for six years thereafter, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present
and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including for the avoidance of doubt persons holding similar positions, such
as managers of a limited liability company) (each, an "Indemnified Person")
with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including advancing fees and expenses of legal counsel, experts
and litigation consultants, and the cost of any appeal bonds in advance of
the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
advance shall be conditioned upon the Surviving Corporations receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount
(without the posting of any bond or collateral) if it shall be ultimately
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
7.03(a)) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
collectively, a "Proceeding"), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of,
in whole or in part, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
or (ii) acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law and as
provided under the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
in effect on the date hereof and under any indemnification agreements with
the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability and

 



 

44  indemnification of past and present officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company in existence on the date of this
Agreement.

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain all directors and
officers insurance policies (including primary and any excess policies) and
the existing fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company
on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Existing DandO Insurance"),
for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time with respect
to any claim arising in whole or in part from or otherwise relating to facts
or events that actually or allegedly occurred during any period or time at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ that
Parent may substitute for the Existing DandO Insurance policies of
substantially equivalent coverage and amounts, including terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Existing DandO Insurance;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the Existing DandO Insurance expires or is terminated or canceled during
such period through no fault of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, then
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain and maintain for such six
year period policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts,
including terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no
less favorable than the coverage provided under the Existing DandO
Insurance; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an aggregate annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the aggregate amount
per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (the "Maximum
Premium"). In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may obtain prior to the
Effective Time one or more prepaid and non-cancelable directors and officers
insurance tail policies applicable for a period of at least six years from
and after the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the Company
shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of
such tail policy and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto and any such
insurance tail policies shall provide substantially equivalent coverage and
amounts, including terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Existing DandO
Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that the aggregate premiums for such tail
policies shall not exceed the Maximum Premium; and _provided_ , _further_ that
if the Company is unable to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, tail policies
meeting the above requirements, the Company may instead obtain prior to
the Effective Time as much comparable insurance for such six year period as

45 (d) Notwithstanding anything otherwise provided herein, if any Proceeding
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
individual who is now, or who has been at any time prior to the date hereof,
or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this Section 7.03 shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Proceeding.

 

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.03.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.03 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and
his or her personal representatives, and the rights of each such Person under
this Section 7.03 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

Section 7.04. _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided) to each
Continuing Employee (i) a base salary that is not less than the base salary
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) benefits (other than cash incentive compensation, equity based
compensation and severance benefits) on such terms as are provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that
Parent in its discretion may elect to provide (or cause to be provided) any
such benefit for a transitional period following the Effective Time on terms
that are generally consistent with the terms on which such benefit were
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (iii) severance benefits to any Continuing Employee in accordance with
Section 7.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that the
aggregate amount of such benefits that are provided to any such Continuing
U.K. Employee shall not be less than the aggregate amount of such benefits
that would have been payable to such employee under the applicable policy of
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided) to each Continuing
Employee and each Offeree, in each case who is



 

46  employed with Parent, Parent UK or Parent India or any of their respective
Subsidiaries on the payment date of the annual bonuses for Parents
performance year ending April 15, 2011 (the "2011 Performance Year"), with an
annual bonus (the "2011 Bonus") for the 2011 Performance Year that is not less
than the annual bonus (the "2010 Bonus") that such employee would have
earned for the performance year ending September 30, 2010 (the "2010
Performance Year"), assuming for such purpose that (w) such employees 2010
Performance Year title and base salary had been the same as such employees
title and base salary as of April 30, 2011 and (x) such employee was employed
with the Company for the entire 2010 Performance Year; _provided_ that (A) the
level of attainment of the applicable performance criteria for the 2011
Performance Year, as determined in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice, is not less than the level of attainment of the applicable
performance criteria for the 2010 Performance Year that would have been
necessary to earn the 2010 Bonus and (B) if applicable, the 2011 Bonus shall
be pro rated to reflect the portion of the period from October 1, 2010 through
April 15, 2011 that such employee was employed with the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates. Parent also intends to
develop an additional bonus program for the 2011 Performance Year designed to
incentivize Continuing U.S. Employees, Offerees principally based in the
United States and other Parent employees, in each case who are in client
facing roles, to work together and promote synergies.

(b) Following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to,
comply with all obligations under (i) the Companys policies set forth in
Section 7.04(a) and 7.04(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) the
Change in Control Agreements for operations partners set forth in Section
4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Each Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for all services with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent
that the Company provides such past service credit) for all purposes under
Parents plans, programs and arrangements with respect to (i) any applicable
statutory leave ( _e.g._ , FMLA) to the extent that such service is required
to be recognized under Applicable Law, (ii) severance and short-term
disability and (iii) vacation. For the avoidance of doubt, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, the Continuing Employees shall not
receive any credit for such service under any other employee benefit plans,
programs or arrangements of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which any Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to



 

47  such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans of the Company or
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee, for the plan year ending June 30, 2011, with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
analogous requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

(e) With respect to any vacation policy maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, subject to Applicable Law
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor vacation time (not to
exceed 22 days) earned but not used by each Continuing Employee as of the
Effective Time under the applicable vacation policy of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

(f) Each bonus earned by an employee of the Company in respect of
the Companys performance year ending September 30, 2010, shall be paid in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in
accordance with Section 7.04(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (as in
effect on the date of this Agreement) between October 1, 2010 and October 31,
2010 by the Company or its Subsidiaries, if such date occurs prior to the
Effective Time, or by Parent or its Subsidiaries, if such date occurs
following the Effective Time, in each case subject to such employees
remaining employed with the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries,
as applicable, through such date, if such date occurs prior to the Effective
Time, or through the Effective Time, if such date occurs following the
Effective Time.

(g) The parties will cooperate in good faith prior to the Effective Time to
determine whether, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
contribute to the account of each U.S. employee under the Company 401(k) Plan
the Company matching contribution for 2010. If such contribution is not made
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, make such contribution to the account of each U.S.
employee no later than January 31, 2011.

 

(h) Nothing in this Section 7.04 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, (ii) prohibit Parent, Parent UK,
Parent India or any of their respective Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, from amending any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement;
_provided_ that Parent, Parent UK, Parent India and their respective
Subsidiaries shall not amend, terminate or otherwise modify the Companys
bonus plans in effect at the Effective Time, and any bonuses shall be paid in
accordance with Section 7.04(f), (iii) require Parent UK, Parent India or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
continue the employment of any employee for any period of time or, subject to
any applicable arrangement 



 

48  covering such employee, to provide such employee with any payments or
benefits upon or following any termination of such employees employment or
(iv) confer any rights or benefits on any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of
any Company SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) the Companys representations and warranties if
the relevance of that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) 



 

58  such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to a person
who has read that information concurrently with such representations and
warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter(s) so disclosed; _provided_ that in no event shall any
information contained in any part of any Company SEC Document entitled "Risk
Factors" or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking
Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of)
any representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement.

 

(c) The parties hereto agree that there may be included in the Company
Disclosure Schedule and elsewhere in this Agreement items and information
that are not "material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance)
is "material" and will not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms
"material," "materially," "materiality" or any word or phrase of similar
import used herein. Matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule are
not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Schedule. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure
Schedule relating to a possible breach or violation of any contract or
Applicable Law will be construed as an admission or indication that such
breach or violation exists or has occurred.

Section 11.06.  _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.03,
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.03, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more Subsidiaries of Parent or Merger Subsidiary; provided
that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary
of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any
other party hereto.

 

Section 11.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.



 

59 Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware
Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

Section 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication).

Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. 

Section 11.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in 



 

60  full force and effect and the application of such term, provision, covenant
or restriction to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder
shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby or by Law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy
shall not preclude the exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting
any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in
any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on
the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent or Merger Subsidiary, on the other hand, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement.
