-iii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of September 26,
2010 among Southwest Airlines Co., a Texas corporation (" _Southwest_ "),
AirTran Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (" _AirTran_ "), and Guadalupe
Holdings Corp., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest
(" _Merger Sub_ "). 

WHEREAS, Southwest and AirTran have determined to engage in a strategic
business combination whereby Merger Sub will be merged with and into AirTran,
with AirTran continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger as a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest (the " _Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, Southwest and AirTran have determined that immediately after the
effectiveness of the Merger, AirTran shall be merged with and into a wholly
owned limited liability company subsidiary of Southwest organized under the
laws of the State of Texas (" _LLC Sub_ ," and such merger being referred to
herein as the " _LLC Sub Merger_ "), with LLC Sub continuing as the surviving
entity in the LLC Sub Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
and the LLC Sub Merger constitute an integrated plan described in Rev. Rul.
2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321 (the " _Integrated Transaction_ ");

 

WHEREAS, in the event that the Integrated Transaction qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, then the parties intend for this Agreement and the LLC Sub Merger
Agreement to constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal income Tax purposes;

WHEREAS, in the event that the Integrated Transaction does not qualify as a
reorganization, the parties intend to treat the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger
as separate transactions for U.S. federal income Tax purposes not subject to
the "integration doctrine" pursuant to Ruling 90-95, 1990-2 C.B. 67;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Southwest, AirTran, and Merger
Sub have approved this Agreement and determined that the terms of this
Agreement are in the best interests of Southwest, AirTran, or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, and their respective stockholders;

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of AirTran and Merger Sub have
declared the advisability of this Agreement and recommended adoption of this
Agreement by their respective stockholders; and

WHEREAS, Southwest, AirTran, and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree as
follows: 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with Nevada Revised Statutes (the " _NRS_ ")
Chapter 92A, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub will be merged with and into
AirTran. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
will cease and AirTran will continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Southwest.

1.2  _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger will take place
at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., Trammell Crow Center, 2001 Ross
Avenue, Suite 3700, Dallas, Texas 75201 at 10:00 a.m., Central time, on
a date to be specified by Southwest and AirTran, which shall be no later than
the second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by Law) by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of
the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by Law) of those conditions),
or at such other place, time, and date as shall be agreed in writing between
Southwest and AirTran; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if any of the conditions
set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ is not satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted
by Law) on such second Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the
first Business Day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or
waived (to the extent permitted by Law). The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon
as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties will file with the Nevada
Secretary of State articles of merger in such form as required by, and
executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
Chapter 92A of the NRS (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, will make all other filings required
under Nevada Law or by the Nevada Secretary of State in connection with the
Merger. The Merger will become effective on the date and at the time that the
Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Nevada Secretary of State, or
at such later time as Southwest and AirTran shall agree and specify in the
Articles of Merger, which time, pursuant to NRS 92A.240(1), must not be more
than 90 days after the date of such filing (the date and time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Nevada Law.



 

-2- 1.5 _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 

(a) The AirTran Charter as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be amended and restated in its entirety in the Merger to read as the
articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "AirTran
Holdings, Inc.," and as so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, the AirTran Bylaws shall be amended and restated
in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"AirTran Holdings, Inc.," and as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
Law.

 

1.6 _Directors and Officers_. Each of Southwest, AirTran, and Merger Sub shall
take all necessary action to cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time to be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law, and
the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case retaining their
respective positions, until the earlier of their death, resignation, or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified.

1.7 _Post-Closing Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time,
Southwest shall cause the Surviving Corporation to merge with and into LLC
Sub, with LLC Sub continuing as the surviving entity in such merger as a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest, substantially in accordance with
the terms of the merger agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _LLC
Sub Merger Agreement_ "). There shall be no condition to the completion of the
LLC Sub Merger other than the completion of the Merger. From and after
the LLC Sub Merger, LLC Sub shall be the Surviving Corporation for purposes
of this Agreement. When the LLC Sub Merger occurs, Southwest shall own all of
the membership interests and other equity in LLC Sub, and LLC Sub shall be
disregarded for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK;

 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Southwest, AirTran, Merger Sub, or the
holder of any shares of AirTran Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:

(a)  _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable share of the Surviving Corporations common stock, par value
$0.001 per share.

(b) _Shares of AirTran Common Stock Held by AirTran, Southwest, or
Subsidiaries_. Each share of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of
AirTran (such shares, the " _AirTran Common Stock_ "), held by AirTran or a
AirTran Subsidiary or Southwest, Merger Sub, or another Southwest Subsidiary
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be issued or delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

-3- (c) _Conversion of AirTran Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.5(e)_,
each share of AirTran Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_, but including all AirTran Restricted Shares in accordance
with  _Section 2.4(a)_), shall be converted into the right to receive (i)
the number (or fraction) of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Southwest (the " _Southwest
Common Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio (such shares of Southwest Common
Stock into which shares of AirTran Common Stock are converted pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(c)_, the " _Base Per Share Stock Consideration_ ," and as the
same may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_, the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ "), and (ii) $3.75 in cash, without interest (the " _Base Per
Share Cash Consideration_ ," and as the same may be adjusted pursuant to
_Section 2.1(e)_, the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ "). All shares of
AirTran Common Stock converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist. Each holder of a certificate, whether
represented in certificated or non-certificated book-entry form, to the extent
applicable, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of AirTran Common Stock (each such certificate a " _Certificate_ ")
shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Certificate and the AirTran
Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Southwest Common Stock to be paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with _Section 2.5(e)_ and any dividends
or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.5(c)_, without interest. As
used in this Agreement, the " _Merger Consideration_ " means the Per Share
Stock Consideration _plus_ the Per Share Cash Consideration.

(d) _Exchange Ratio_. The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be determined as follows:

 

(i) in the event that the Southwest Average Share Price is less than $10.90,
the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to (A) $3.50 divided by (B) the Southwest
Average Share Price, rounded to the nearest thousandth;

(ii) in the event that the Southwest Average Share Price is equal to or
greater than $10.90 but less than or equal to $12.46, the Exchange Ratio shall
be 0.321.

 

(iii) in the event that the Southwest Average Share Price is greater than
$12.46, the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to (A) $4.00 divided by (B) the
Southwest Average Share Price, rounded to the nearest thousandth.

As used in this Agreement, (i) " _Southwest Average Share Price_ " means the
average of the last reported sale prices for a single share of Southwest
Common Stock (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source selected by mutual agreement of
Southwest and AirTran) on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), or if
the Southwest Common Stock is not then listed on the NYSE then the principal
securities market on which the Southwest Common Stock is then listed or
quoted, for the 20 consecutive full Trading Days on which such shares are
actually traded on the NYSE (or such other market) ending on (and including)
the third Trading Day prior to the Closing Date and (ii) " _Trading Day_ "
means any day on which securities are traded on the NYSE (or such other
market).



 

-4- (e) _Adjustment to Base Per Share Stock Consideration and Base Per Share
Cash Consideration_. In the event that the Southwest Average Share Price is
less than $10.90, Southwest shall deliver, in such form as Southwest may
elect, an additional amount of cash, an additional number (or a fraction) of
shares of Southwest Common Stock, or a combination of additional cash and an
additional number (or fraction) of shares of Southwest Common Stock (which
shares shall be valued based on the Southwest Average Share Price) such that,
after giving effect to the delivery of such additional cash and/or shares of
Southwest Common Stock, the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration
(valuing Southwest Common Stock based on the Southwest Average Share Price) is
equal to $7.25. If such additional cash and/or shares are delivered, (i) the
Base Per Share Stock Consideration shall be adjusted to be the number (or
fraction) of shares of Southwest Common Stock into which each share of AirTran
Common Stock is to be converted into the right to receive pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(c)_ as a result of such additional cash and/or shares being
delivered and (ii) the Base Per Share Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to
be the aggregate amount of cash into which each share of AirTran Common Stock
is to be converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ as
a result of such additional cash and/or shares being delivered.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Southwest make such an
election that would increase the number of shares of Southwest Common Stock
that would be delivered in the Merger in lieu of additional cash to the extent
that doing so would require a vote of the stockholders of Southwest with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.2 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by  _ARTICLE V_ ), the outstanding shares of
Southwest Common Stock or AirTran Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination, or exchange
of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Per Share Stock
Consideration, and only with respect to changes in the outstanding shares
of AirTran Common Stock, the Per Share Cash Consideration, shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of
AirTran Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 2.2_ shall be construed as permitting AirTran to take any action or
enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

 

2.3 _No Dissenters  Rights_. Pursuant to NRS 92A.390, no dissenters rights
or rights of appraisal will apply in connection with the Merger.

2.4 _Treatment of AirTran Equity Awards; Participation By Restricted and
Unvested Shares_. 

(a) _AirTran Restricted Shares_. The fact that any AirTran Restricted Share
which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time has
not yet vested under any AirTran Stock Plan under which it was issued shall
not affect the right of the holder thereof to receive the Merger
Consideration, and, prior to the Effective Time, the AirTran Board (or
any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof administering the
AirTran Stock Plans) shall



 

-5-  adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to
effect that all such AirTran Restricted Shares shall automatically and without
any required action on the part of any holder thereof be deemed to be vested
and free of restrictions as of the Effective Time, any provision of any such
plan or this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, and shall be treated
the same as other issued and outstanding shares of AirTran Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

(b) _AirTran Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the AirTran Board
(or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof administering the
AirTran Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
as may be required to effect that, effective as of the Effective Time,
each outstanding AirTran Stock Option, other than those issued under the
AirTran 1994 Stock Option Plan, the AirTran 1996 Stock Option Plan, or the
AirTran ESPP, whether or not then exercisable as provided under the terms
thereof, shall automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof be converted into only the right to receive (without
interest), as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than three Business
Days following the Effective Time, an amount in cash, less all applicable
deductions and withholdings required by Law to be withheld in respect of such
amount, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share
Cash Equivalent Amount over (B) the exercise price per share of such AirTran
Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of AirTran Common Stock
underlying such AirTran Stock Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Prior
to the Effective Time, AirTran shall seek and use reasonable best efforts to
obtain from each holder of an outstanding AirTran Stock Option issued under
the AirTran 1994 Stock Option Plan or the AirTran 1996 Stock Option Plan an
acknowledgment in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Southwest that
each such AirTran Stock Option held by such holder will be automatically and
without any further required action on the part of such holder, converted
effective as of the Effective Time into only the right to receive (without
interest), as soon as practicable but no later than three Business Days
following the Effective Time, the Option Consideration. With respect to all
outstanding AirTran Stock Options issued under the AirTran 1994 Stock Option
Plan or the AirTran 1996 Stock Option Plan that are not converted into the
right to receive the Option Consideration as of the Effective Time pursuant to
this _Section 2.4(b)_, no discretionary vesting of any such AirTran Stock
Option shall occur in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all such AirTran Stock Options shall continue to be governed by
the AirTran 1994 Stock Option Plan or the AirTran 1996 Stock Option Plan, as
applicable. All AirTran Stock Options converted pursuant to this _Section
2.4(b)_, when so converted as of the Effective Time, shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and shall cease to
exist, and such cancellation shall be a release of any and all rights the
holder has or may have had in respect of such AirTran Stock Option, other than
the right to receive the Option Consideration.

 

(c) _AirTran Performance Shares_. Prior to the Effective Time, the AirTran
Board (or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof administering
the AirTran Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to the effect that, effective as of the Effective
Time, each AirTran Performance Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and
without any required action on the part of any holder thereof be vested as to
the target number (i.e., 100%) of shares of AirTran Common Stock that could be
earned under the applicable AirTran Stock Plan or other agreement with
AirTran under which such AirTran Performance Share was granted, the



 

-6-  performance period applicable to such AirTran Performance Shares shall be
deemed to have terminated as of the Closing Date, such that the number of
AirTran Performance Shares deemed earned shall be pro rated by multiplying
such target number of AirTran Performance Shares by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the actual number of whole months in the shortened performance
period and the denominator of which is the number of whole months in the
original performance period (" _Earned Performance Shares_ "), and each such
Earned Performance Share shall entitle the holder thereof to receive (without
interest) the Per Share Cash Equivalent Amount, paid-out at the time
set forth in the AirTran Stock Plan, Current Employee Benefit Plan and/or
award agreement applicable to such AirTran Performance Share.

 

(d) _AirTran Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the AirTran
Board (or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof administering
the AirTran Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to freeze the AirTran 1995 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _AirTran ESPP_ ") no later than the end of the calendar month in
which the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(a)_ and _7.1(c)_ are satisfied
(the " _ESPP Freeze Date_ "). The ESPP Freeze Date shall be an "Offering
Termination Date" (as defined in the AirTran ESPP), and no new "Offering
Period" (as defined in the AirTran ESPP) shall commence following the ESPP
Freeze Date. Any accumulated amounts remaining in the accounts of participants
in the AirTran ESPP following the ESPP Freeze Date shall be distributed to
the appropriate participants at or prior to the Effective Time. In the event
the Effective Time occurs prior to the ESPP Freeze Date, each participant in
the AirTran ESPP that holds outstanding AirTran Stock Options under
the AirTran ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive, on
the ESPP Freeze Date, upon the exercise of any such AirTran Stock Option for
each share of AirTran Common Stock as to which such AirTran Stock Option shall
be exercised, as nearly as reasonably may be determined, the Merger
Consideration, in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

(e) At the Effective Time, Southwest shall assume the obligations and succeed
to the rights of AirTran under the AirTran Stock Plans with respect to AirTran
Equity Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, AirTran and Southwest shall take
all action required to reflect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
2.4_ to ensure that, following the Effective Time, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 2.4(d)_, no Person other than Southwest and its
Subsidiaries shall have the right (i) to acquire equity securities of AirTran
or any Subsidiary thereof in respect of any AirTran Equity Award or (ii) to
receive any payment in respect of any AirTran Equity Award, in each case
referred to in _clause (i)_ and  _(ii)_ , other than with respect to the
payment of the consideration contemplated in this _Section 2.4_. From and
after the Effective Time, all references to AirTran (other than any references
relating to a "change in control" of AirTran) in each AirTran Stock Plan and
in each agreement evidencing any AirTran Equity Award shall be deemed to refer
to Southwest.

 

2.5 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Southwest or Merger Sub
will designate a commercial bank, trust company, or transfer agent reasonably
acceptable to AirTran to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the delivery of the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Southwest shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange



 

-7-  in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ through the Exchange Agent, sufficient
cash and Southwest Common Stock to make pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ all
deliveries of cash and Southwest Common Stock as required by this _ARTICLE
II_ (other than _Section 2.4(b)_ through _(e)_ ). In addition, Southwest
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares of Southwest Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)_ and
to pay any dividends or other distributions which holders of Certificates have
the right to receive pursuant to  _Section 2.5(c)_. All such cash and
Southwest Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as
payments in lieu of fractional shares of Southwest Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.5(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions that holders of
Certificates have the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_) is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Southwest shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of AirTran Common Stock were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration a letter of transmittal which shall (i) specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and (ii)
provide instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant
to such letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to the instructions thereto or by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) shares
of Southwest Common Stock representing that number of whole shares of
Southwest Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ in respect of the aggregate number of shares of AirTran Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificate and (ii) a check
representing the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the aggregate number of shares of AirTran Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to  _Section 2.1_,
including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Southwest Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)_ and in respect of any dividends or other
distributions that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to  _Section
2.5(c)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. The
Exchange Agent will not accept guarantee of delivery of a Certificate in lieu
of actual delivery. In the event of a transfer of ownership of AirTran Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of AirTran, (i) shares of
Southwest Common Stock representing the proper number of shares of Southwest
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and (ii) a check representing the
proper amount of cash pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares of Southwest Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.5(e)_ and in respect of any dividends or other distributions that the
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_, may be
delivered to a transferee if the Certificate representing such AirTran Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.5(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time at and
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder of such Certificate has the
right to receive in respect of such Certificate. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Southwest Common Stock, or on any unpaid dividends or other distributions
payable to holders of Certificates.



 

-8- (c) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Southwest Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Southwest Common Stock deliverable
upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of
Southwest Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
2.5(e)_, until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
_ARTICLE II_. Subject to escheat or other applicable Law, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
due pursuant to _Section 2.1_, cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Southwest Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.5(e)_, and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
number of whole shares of Southwest Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such number of whole
shares of Southwest Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to  _Section 2.1(c)_.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in AirTran Common Stock_. The shares of
Southwest Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms
of this _ARTICLE II_ upon conversion of any shares of AirTran Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of AirTran Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
as stockholders of AirTran other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Southwest Common
Stock to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with _Section
2.5(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions that holders have the right
to receive upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section
2.5(c)_, without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of AirTran shall
be closed with respect to all shares of AirTran Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of AirTran Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of AirTran Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Southwest, or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _ARTICLE II_. Shares of Southwest Common Stock held in the Exchange
Fund, until their issuance in the Merger upon surrender of Certificates or
until such shares are delivered to a Governmental Authority or Southwest as
contemplated by _Section 2.5(g)_, shall be deemed issued and outstanding
shares of Southwest Common Stock. In connection with any meeting of
shareholders of Southwest, the Exchange Agent shall be directed to cause such
shares to be present and counted for purposes of determining the presence of
a quorum, and the Exchange Agent shall be directed to cause such shares to be
voted for, voted against, abstained, and not voted in the same proportion as
the shares of Southwest Common Stock outstanding and not held in the
Exchange Fund. From and after such time as any shares of Southwest Common
Stock held in the Exchange Fund are



 

-9-  returned to Southwest as contemplated by the last sentence of _Section
2.5(g)_, such shares shall be deemed to be held in treasury and shall not be
considered issued and outstanding shares of Southwest Common Stock.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Southwest
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates,
no dividend or distribution of Southwest shall relate to such fractional share
interests, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Southwest. 

(ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Southwest shall pay to each
former holder of AirTran Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such former
holder (after taking into account all shares of AirTran Common Stock held at
the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the
Southwest Average Share Price.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Southwest, upon demand, and, subject to _Section 2.5(g)_, any holder of
Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_ shall
thereafter look only to Southwest as a general unsecured creditor for
satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Southwest Common Stock, and any dividends and
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
_ARTICLE II_.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Southwest, AirTran, Merger Sub, or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a Governmental Authority
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the
Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this _ARTICLE
II_ that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates as of the second
anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Southwest, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Southwest on a daily basis; _provided_ ,
that, subject to _Section 2.5(g)_, no such investment or losses will reduce
the cash payable by Southwest to holders of Certificates. Any interest or
other amounts received with respect to such investments shall be paid to
Southwest.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Southwest and the Exchange Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be 



 

-10-  deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted, withheld, and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by
Southwest, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Southwest may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section
2.5(g)_, Southwest) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

standing under the laws of the State of Nevada. AirTran has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the

this Agreement, the term: (i) " _Effect_ " means individually or collectively
any change, circumstance, event, or effect; and (ii) " _AirTran Material
Adverse Effect_ " means any Effect that is, or would reasonably be expected

whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Effect to the extent arising out of,
resulting from, or attributable to the following shall be deemed to constitute
a AirTran Material Adverse Effect or shall be taken

 



 

-11-  into account when determining whether a AirTran Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or is reasonably expected to occur: (A) general economic conditions;
(B) any changes in GAAP, applicable Law, or the interpretation thereof; (C)
the taking of any specific action at the request or direction of an executive
officer of Southwest; (D) factors generally affecting the airline industry,
including changes in the general level of yields of or prices of aircraft,
aircraft parts, or fuel; (E) the failure of AirTran to meet any internal or
public forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings for any period (it being
understood that any cause underlying such failure may be taken into
consideration when determining whether a AirTran Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or is reasonably expected to occur); (F) the entry into this
Agreement or the announcement, pendency, or consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any loss or threatened loss of, or
adverse change or threatened adverse change in, the relationship of AirTran or

or renders unusable any material portion of the assets or properties of
AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); or (I) any change,
or announcement of a potential change, in the credit rating of AirTran or any
of the AirTran Subsidiaries or any of their securities or any decline in the
market price, or a change in the trading volume, of the shares of AirTran
Common Stock (it being understood that any cause of any such change,
announcement, or decline may be taken into consideration when determining
whether a AirTran Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur); _provided further_ , _however_ , that any Effect referred
to in _clauses (A)_, _(B)_ , or _(D)_ immediately above may be taken into
account in determining whether a AirTran Material Adverse Effect has occurred
or is reasonably expected to occur to the extent (but only to the extent) that
such Effect has a materially disproportionate effect on AirTran and the
AirTran Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (relative to the adverse effect on
publicly traded domestic air carriers of the same or similar size, financial
resources, and financial condition as AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole).

 

(b) The copies of AirTrans articles of incorporation (the " _AirTran Charter_

to carry on its business as now conducted, except with respect to _clauses
(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or have

Effect. As used in this Agreement, (i) " _Subsidiary_ ," when used with

company, or other entity or organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, (A) of which such party or any other Subsidiary of such party

proxy statement (including all exhibits, amendments, and supplements thereto
and all information incorporated by reference) required to be filed or
furnished by AirTran with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
(the " _AirTran SEC Filings_ ") since January 1, 2009. The AirTran SEC
Filings (i) were filed or furnished on a timely basis, (ii) complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (iii) did not at
the time they were filed (and if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) will
be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. There is no Proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of AirTran, threatened against AirTran or any

the date of this Agreement, (i) none of the AirTran SEC Filings is the subject

case to the extent not publicly available as of the date of this Agreement. No
AirTran Subsidiary is required to file or furnish any reports or other
documents with the SEC. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Knowledge of
AirTran_ " means the actual knowledge of any executive officer of AirTran or
of the controller of AirTran.

any related notes thereto) contained in the AirTran SEC Filings (including
each of the AirTran SEC Filings filed or furnished after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time) (the " _AirTran Financial Statements_ "):
(i) complied (and will comply) as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto in effect at the time of such filing; (ii) was
prepared (and will be prepared) in all 



 

-18-  material respects in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout

the case of unaudited statements, except for the absence of footnotes as
permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC); and (iii) fairly presented
(and will fairly present) in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of AirTran and its consolidated Subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of AirTrans and its consolidated
Subsidiaries operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except
that the unaudited interim financial statements were (or will be) subject to
normal year-end adjustments which were not (or are not expected to be)
material in amount. Except as reflected in or reserved against on the
AirTran Financial Statements, neither AirTran nor any AirTran Subsidiary is a
party to any material off-balance sheet arrangement (as defined in Item 303 of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act (" _Regulation S-K_
")). AirTran has not had any dispute with any of its auditors regarding
accounting matters or policies requiring public reporting, a report to the
audit committee, or which is otherwise material. The books and records of
AirTran and each of the AirTran Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable Law and
applicable accounting requirements under GAAP.

 

(c)(i) AirTran has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)

procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both
financial and non-financial) relating to AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries
required to be disclosed in AirTrans reports required to be filed with or
submitted to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act is communicated to AirTrans
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of AirTran required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports. Based on AirTrans most recent evaluation of
its disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date of this Agreement,
AirTran has determined that such disclosure controls and procedures were
effective for such purposes as of the date of such evaluation.

 

(d) AirTran and each of the AirTran Subsidiaries has implemented, and
maintains and enforces, a system of internal control over financial reporting
that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of AirTrans financial
reporting and the preparation of AirTrans financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Based on AirTrans most recent evaluation of
its internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this
Agreement, AirTran has disclosed to AirTrans auditors and audit committee (i)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
its internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect AirTrans ability to record, process, summarize, and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees of AirTran or any AirTran Subsidiary

certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and any related rules
and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the AirTran SEC Filings,
except for such instances of noncompliance as would not result in a AirTran
Material Adverse Effect, and the statements contained in any such
certifications were true and accurate as of the date such certifications were
made and have not been modified or withdrawn. Neither AirTran nor any of its
executive officers has received notice from any Governmental Authority
challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form, or manner of
filing of the certifications required by SOX and made by its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer.

(f) AirTran is in compliance with all applicable provisions of SOX and
the applicable listing and governance rules of the NYSE, except for such
instances of noncompliance as would not result in a AirTran Material Adverse

3.21 _AirTran Slots and Operating Rights_. _Section 3.21_ of the AirTran
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of all takeoff and
landing slots, operating authorizations from the FAA or any other Governmental
Authority and other similar designated takeoff and landing rights used or held
by AirTran or any AirTran Subsidiary (the " _AirTran Slots_ ") at any
domestic or international airport and such list indicates any AirTran Slots
that have been permanently allocated to another air carrier and in which
AirTran or a AirTran Subsidiary holds only temporary use rights. AirTran
and the AirTran Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects and are
in compliance in all material respects with all regulations of the FAA and
each



 

-35-  other Governmental Authority with respect to the AirTran Slots. Neither
AirTran nor any of the AirTran Subsidiaries has (a) received any written

other Governmental Authority or (b) agreed to any future slide, trade (except

the AirTran Slots that has not been consummated. The AirTran Slots have not
been designated for the provision of essential air service under the
regulations of the FAA, were not acquired pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Section

been used during each full reporting period (as described in 14 C.F.R. Section
93.227(i) or any such order, notice, or requirement) or such greater or
lesser amount of minimum usage as may have been required to protect such
AirTran Slots authorization from termination or withdrawal under regulations
or waivers established by any airport authority or any other Governmental
Authority. All material reports required by the FAA or any other Governmental
Authority relating to the AirTran Slots have been filed in a timely manner.

 

3.22 _AirTran Airports_. As of the date of this Agreement, no airport
authority at any airport at which AirTran operates (each such airport, a "
_AirTran Airport_ ") has taken any action or, to the Knowledge of AirTran, is
any such action threatened, that would reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with the ability of AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries to conduct
their respective operations at any AirTran Airport in substantially the manner
as currently conducted.

3.23 _Title to Property and Assets_. AirTran or a AirTran Subsidiary has good
and valid title to, or has a valid leasehold interest in, or valid rights
under contract to use, all of the tangible assets and properties and any
intangible assets reflected in the Latest Balance Sheet, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the conduct of the business of AirTran and AirTran
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (except for assets and properties disposed of
since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice), free and clear of all Encumbrances, except
Permitted Encumbrances, and except for Encumbrances which secure Indebtedness
reflected in the Latest Balance Sheet or incurred since the date of the
Latest Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business; and all leases
pursuant to which AirTran or any AirTran Subsidiary leases from others any
real or personal property, are in good standing, valid and effective in
accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such
leases, any existing default or event of default (or event which with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default), on the part of AirTran
or any AirTran Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of AirTran, any third party,
except where the lack of such good standing or failure to be valid and
effective would result in a AirTran Material Adverse Effect. The rights,
assets, and properties owned, leased, or licensed by AirTran and the AirTran
Subsidiaries include all rights, assets, and properties necessary to permit
AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses in all
material respects in the same manner as their businesses have been conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, " _Permitted
Encumbrances_ " means (a) liens shown on the Latest Balance Sheet as securing
specified liabilities or obligations and liens incurred in connection with the
purchase of property and/or assets, if such purchase was effected after the
date of the Latest Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business



 

-36-  consistent with past practice, with respect to which no default exists; (b)
minor imperfections of title, if any, none of which are substantial in amount,
detract from the value or impair the use of the property subject thereto, or
impair the operations of AirTran or Southwest or any AirTran Subsidiary or
Southwest Subsidiary, as the case may be, and which have arisen only in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the date of
the Latest Balance Sheet; (c) liens for current Taxes not yet due or
delinquent; and (d) such minor title defects, failure to have valid leasehold
interest in, or objections, liens, claims, charges, security interests, or
other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever, if any, as, individually or in
the aggregate, do not materially impair the value of the property subject to
such Encumbrance or the use of the property in the conduct of the business
of AirTran and any AirTran Subsidiary.

3.24 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) To the Knowledge of AirTran, the conduct of the business as currently

against AirTran or any of the AirTran Subsidiaries that have not been settled
or withdrawn prior to the date of this Agreement. During the three-year period
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, there has been no
Proceeding asserted or, to the Knowledge of AirTran, threatened in writing,

infringement, use, or licensed right to use any Intellectual Property Rights
claimed to be owned or held by AirTran or any of the AirTran Subsidiaries or
used or alleged to be used in the business of AirTran or any of the AirTran
Subsidiaries, except as would not result in a AirTran Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The computer software and databases (including source code, object code,
and all related documentation), computers, firmware, middleware, servers,
workstations, routers, hubs, switches, data communications lines, and all
other information technology equipment and elements and all associated
documentation of AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries (i) operate and perform
in accordance with their documentation and functional specifications and
otherwise as required by AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries for
the operation of their respective businesses and (ii) have not malfunctioned
or failed within the three-year period immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement, except, in the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , as would
not result in a AirTran Material Adverse Effect. AirTran and the AirTran
Subsidiaries have implemented and maintained for the three-year period
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement reasonable and sufficient
backup and disaster recovery technology consistent with industry practices,
except as would not result in a AirTran Material Adverse Effect.

3.25  _Compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other
Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws_. Except as would not result in a AirTran
Material Adverse Effect:

 

(a) Neither AirTran, nor any AirTran Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of

thereof is to be paid by the recipient to an official or employee of any

back.

(b) No Governmental Authority has notified AirTran or any of the AirTran
Subsidiaries in writing of any actual or alleged violation or breach of the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and

(c) Neither AirTran nor any of the AirTran Subsidiaries has undergone or is
undergoing any audit, review, inspection, investigation, survey, or

Material Adverse Effect_ " means any Effect that is, or would reasonably be
expected to be, materially adverse to the assets, business, financial

extent) that such Effect has a materially disproportionate effect on
Southwest and the Southwest Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (relative to the
adverse effect on publicly traded domestic air carriers of same or similar
size, financial resources, and financial condition as Southwest and the
Southwest Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

proxy statement (including all exhibits, amendments, and supplements thereto
and all information incorporated by reference) required to be filed or

Act (the " _Southwest SEC Filings_ ") since January 1, 2009. The Southwest

form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (iii) did not
at the time they were filed (and if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) will
be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. There is no Proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Southwest, threatened against Southwest or any
Southwest Subsidiary at or before the SEC. To the Knowledge of Southwest, as
of the date of this Agreement, (i) none of the Southwest SEC Filings is the
subject of an SEC review or outstanding SEC investigation and (ii) there are
no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the
SEC staff with respect to Southwest SEC Filings. Southwest has made available
to Southwest copies of all comment letters received from the SEC since January

responses of Southwest thereto provided or made available to the SEC, in each
case to the extent not publicly available as of the date of this Agreement. No
Southwest Subsidiary is required to file or furnish any reports or
other documents with the SEC. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Knowledge of
Southwest_ " means the actual knowledge of any executive officer of Southwest
or of the controller of Southwest.

 

(b) Each set of consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Southwest SEC Filings (including
each of the Southwest SEC Filings filed or furnished after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time) (the " _Southwest Financial Statements_
"): (i) complied (and will comply) as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto in effect at the time of such filing; (ii) was
prepared (and will be prepared) in all material respects accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements,
except for the absence of footnotes as permitted by the rules and regulations
of the SEC); and (iii) fairly presented (and will fairly present) in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Southwest and its
consolidated Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
results of Southwests and its consolidated Subsidiaries operations and cash
flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial
statements were (or will be) subject to normal year-end adjustments which were
not (or are not expected to be) material in amount. Except as reflected in or
reserved against on the Southwest Financial Statements, neither Southwest nor
any Southwest Subsidiary is a party to any material off-balance sheet
arrangement (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K).



 

-43-  Southwest has not had any dispute with any of its auditors regarding
accounting matters or policies requiring public reporting, a report to the
audit committee, or which is otherwise material. The books and records of
Southwest and each of the Southwest Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable Law and
applicable accounting requirements.

 

(c)(i) Southwest has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) and (ii) such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both
financial and non-financial) relating to Southwest and the
Southwest Subsidiaries required to be disclosed in Southwests reports
required to be filed with or submitted to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act
is communicated to Southwests management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Southwest
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Based on
Southwests most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date of this Agreement, Southwest has determined that such
disclosure controls and procedures were effective for such purposes as of the
date of such evaluation.

 

(d) Southwest and each of the Southwest Subsidiaries has implemented, and
maintains and enforces, a system of internal control over financial reporting
that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Southwests financial
reporting and the preparation of Southwests financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Based on Southwests most recent evaluation
of its internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this
Agreement, Southwest has disclosed to Southwests auditors and audit committee
(i) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation
of its internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect in Southwests ability to record, process, summarize, and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees of Southwest or any Southwest
Subsidiary who have a significant role in the internal control over financial
reporting of Southwest. As used in this section, "significant deficiency,"
"material weakness," and "internal control over financial reporting" each
have the meaning given to such term in Appendix A of Auditing Standard No. 5
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as in effect on the date of
this Agreement. Since December 31, 2009, none of Southwest, any Southwest

in this _Section 5.6_) or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person
any non-public information or data with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal,
or (iii) resolve, propose, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Subject to
_Section 5.6(b)_, AirTran shall, and shall cause each of the AirTran
Subsidiaries and the Representatives of AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries
to, (x) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions
or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and (y) promptly request and use reasonable best efforts
to obtain the prompt return or cause the destruction of all copies of
confidential information previously furnished to any such Person.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.6(a)_, if at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the AirTran
Stockholder Approval, AirTran receives a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that was not solicited or initiated on or after the date of this
Agreement in violation of _Section 5.6(a)_, and if the AirTran Board (or any
duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) determines in its good
faith judgment, after consulting with and receiving the advice of Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated (or another financial advisor of similar nationally
recognized reputation selected in good faith by the AirTran Board (the "
_AirTran Financial Advisor_ ")) and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that there is a reasonable probability that the failure
to take such action would cause the AirTran Board to violate its fiduciary
duties to AirTran and its stockholders under Nevada Law, AirTran and its
Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information and data (including non-public information) with
respect to AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries to the Person or group of
Persons that has made such Acquisition Proposal and will promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) provide to Southwest copies of any such information not
previously provided to Southwest and (y) engage in, maintain, and participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person or Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal and their Representatives or otherwise cooperate with or
assist or participate in, or encourage or facilitate, any such discussions or
negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The AirTran Board shall not (i) (A) fail to make the Recommendation to
the stockholders of AirTran, or withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner
adverse to Southwest or Merger Sub) the Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve,
recommend, endorse, or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any
Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve, agree, or publicly propose to take any
such actions (each such action set forth in this _Section 5.6(c)(i)_ being
referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause
or permit AirTran or any of the AirTran Subsidiaries to enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement, or other agreement constituting or



 

-54-  related to, or which is intended to or would reasonably be likely to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
"), other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with
_Section 5.6(b)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the AirTran Stockholder Approval, the AirTran Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change:

 

(i) if an event, fact, circumstance, or occurrence, or combination or series
thereof, that was not known to the AirTran Board as of the date of this
Agreement becomes known to the AirTran Board (an " _Intervening Event_ ") or

 

(ii) in response to a Superior Proposal received after the date of this
Agreement, which has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior
Proposal,

in either of _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ , if, and only if, the AirTran Board
determines in good faith (after consulting with and receiving the advice of
outside legal counsel) that there is a reasonable probability that the failure
to do so would cause the AirTran Board to violate its fiduciary duties to
AirTran and its stockholders under Nevada Law, and after such Adverse
Recommendation Change AirTran may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any
Adverse Recommendation Change that is the result of a Superior Proposal or an
Intervening Event (A) (1) no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until
after the second Business Day following Southwests receipt of written notice
from AirTran advising Southwest that management of AirTran will convene a
meeting of the AirTran Board to consider whether the AirTran Board should make
an Adverse Recommendation Change and (2) in the case of a Superior Proposal,
no such termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ may
be made until after the third Business Day following Southwests receipt of
written notice from AirTran advising Southwest that AirTran intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ and specifying
the relevant terms and conditions of (including the identity of the Persons
making the Superior Proposal) the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the AirTran Board, and contemporaneously furnishing to
Southwest a copy of the relevant Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any
other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
change in consideration and any material amendment to the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by
AirTran to Southwest and an additional one Business Day period before AirTran
may terminate this Agreement), (B) during such two or three Business Day
period, as applicable (and any additional one Business Day period), AirTran
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to be available to,
negotiate with Southwest in good faith (to the extent Southwest seeks to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the AirTran Board to proceed with the Recommendation
and not make such an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause AirTran to
terminate this Agreement, and (C) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the
AirTran Board shall not make such an Adverse Recommendation Change and AirTran
shall not terminate this Agreement if, prior to the expiration of such three
Business Day period (or any additional one Business Day period), Southwest
makes a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the
AirTran Board determines in good faith (after consulting with and receiving
the advice of outside legal counsel and the AirTran Financial Advisor) to be
at least as favorable to AirTran and its stockholders as the Superior
Proposal.



 

-55- (d) AirTran agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours)
notify Southwest if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
AirTran, the AirTran Subsidiaries, or any of its or the AirTran Subsidiaries
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers
(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals, or
offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Southwest
informed, on a reasonably current basis (which shall be considered in light of
the circumstances of such proposal or offer and the time by which Southwest
has the opportunity to respond), of the status and terms of any such proposals
or offers (including any amendments thereto).

 

(e) AirTran shall promptly inform its Representatives, and shall cause the
AirTran Subsidiaries promptly to inform their respective Representatives, of
the obligations under this _Section 5.6_. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violation of the provisions of this _Section 5.6_ by
any director or officer of AirTran, either directly or by knowingly
permitting a violation by another Representative of AirTran or any AirTran
Subsidiary, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.6_ by AirTran.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall be deemed to prohibit
AirTran from making any disclosure to AirTrans stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the AirTran Board (after consulting with and receiving the
advice of outside legal counsel) failure to do so would violate AirTrans
disclosure requirements under U.S. federal or state Law;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall any such requirement eliminate or modify
the effect that any action pursuant to such requirement would otherwise have
under this _Section 5.6_; and _provided further_ , that any such disclosure
shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change (including for
purposes of _Section 8.1(c)(i)_) if the AirTran Board publicly reaffirms the
Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a customary
confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms no less favorable
in any material respect to AirTran than those set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that, notwithstanding the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit
the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal to the AirTran Board);
_provided_ , that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance
with any of the provisions of this _Section 5.6_. In the event that AirTran
(i) agrees with the Person or group of Persons that has made an Acquisition
Proposal to a standstill provision in the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
that contains less restrictive terms than the standstill provision in
the Confidentiality Agreement applicable to Southwest, (ii) does not include
a standstill provision in such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, or (iii)
waives any part of a standstill provision in such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement such that such Person or group of Persons is subject to less
restrictive terms than the standstill provision in the Confidentiality
Agreement applicable to Southwest, the terms of the standstill provision in
the Confidentiality Agreement applicable to Southwest shall be deemed, as
applicable,



 

-56-  deleted or revised and amended automatically such that the terms of the
standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement applicable to Southwest
are no more restrictive than the terms applicable to such Person or group of
Persons, and AirTran will promptly provide such new terms to Southwest.

 

(ii) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry (in writing or otherwise),
proposal, indication of interest, or offer from any Person (other than
Southwest, Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates) or "group" (as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) relating to, or that could be reasonably
expected to lead to, (A) the direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
assets of AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries (including securities of
AirTran Subsidiaries) equal to 15% or more of AirTrans consolidated assets
or to which 15% or more of AirTrans revenues or earnings on a consolidated
basis are attributable, (B) the direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions) of 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of AirTran, (C) a tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of AirTran, or (D) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or
similar transaction involving AirTran or any of the AirTran Subsidiaries, in
each case, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that the AirTran Board determines in good faith (after consulting
with and receiving the advice of outside legal counsel and the AirTran
Financial Advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, and
other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal as the AirTran Board, in the good
faith exercise of its fiduciary duties, deems relevant, and taking into
account the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, including the financing
terms and estimated time of completion thereof, would result in a transaction
that is more favorable to AirTran and its stockholders from a financial point
of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into
account (A) any adjustment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Southwest in response to such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
_Section 5.6(c)_ or otherwise and (B) any termination fees and expense
reimbursement provisions);  _provided_ , that for purposes of this definition
of "Superior Proposal," references in the term "Acquisition Proposal" to "15%
or more" shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each
of Southwest and AirTran (i) shall provide the other an opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version
of such document or response) and (ii) shall include in such document or
response all comments reasonably proposed by the other. Southwest shall advise
AirTran, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of

sky" laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
Merger and the issuance of the Merger Consideration.

and Southwest shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement and,

6.1(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 6.1(a)_.

 

(c) AirTran shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
Southwest a letter of Ernst and Young LLP, AirTrans independent public
accountants, (i) dated a date within two business days before the date on

the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold the
AirTran Stockholders Meeting. AirTran shall use reasonable best efforts to (a)
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to AirTrans stockholders as promptly
as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act and to hold the AirTran Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable after

Approval. AirTran shall include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
except to the extent that the AirTran Board shall have made an Adverse

its obligations pursuant to this  _Section 6.2_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure, or communication to AirTran
of any Acquisition Proposal except to the extent (and only to the extent)
expressly stated herein to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the AirTran Board makes an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section 5.6(c)_, upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or _8.1(d)(ii)_ , AirTran shall not be obligated to take
any action otherwise required pursuant to this _Section 6.2_, and AirTran may
cancel the AirTran Stockholders Meeting.

 

6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, AirTran shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, permit Southwest and Southwests
Representatives to have reasonable access to AirTrans Representatives and the
facilities, books, records, Contracts, and documents of or pertaining to
AirTran or the AirTran Subsidiaries within AirTrans possession or control or
over which AirTran may, with reasonable best efforts, obtain possession or
control, and shall furnish Southwest and Merger Sub with all financial,
operating, and other data and information as Southwest or Merger Sub, through
its Representatives, may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
access to competitively sensitive marketing or fare or route planning
information shall only be provided to the extent that such access would not
violate applicable Law as determined in good faith by AirTran (after
consultation with outside legal counsel); and _provided further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require AirTran (i) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that (x) in the good faith judgment of AirTran
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons to whom
AirTran or any AirTran Subsidiary owes a duty of confidentiality or (y)
violate any of AirTrans obligations with respect to confidentiality if in
each such case AirTran shall have promptly used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third Person to such inspection or disclosure, (ii)
to disclose any privileged information of AirTran or any AirTran Subsidiary
if such disclosure would reasonably be likely to result in the loss of such
privileged information, or (iii) to permit invasive testing of any of
AirTrans or any AirTran Subsidiarys real property. In no event
shall AirTran be required to supply to Southwest, or Southwests officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, or other representatives, any information
relating to indications of interest from, or discussions with, any other
potential acquirors of AirTran, except to the extent necessary or advisable
for use in the Proxy Statement and Form S-4 or as required under _Section
5.6_. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.3(a)_ shall be conducted
in a manner which will not interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of the other party. All information exchanged pursuant to this
_Section 6.3(a)_ shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated June
22, 2010 between AirTran and Southwest (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").



 

-59- (b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with 
_ARTICLE VIII_, the parties shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, return promptly every document
furnished to them by the other party or parties or any Representative of the
other party in connection with the Merger and all copies thereof in their
possession, and cause any other parties to whom such documents may have been
furnished promptly to return such documents and all copies thereof.

 

6.4 _Required Actions_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and
cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary
(subject to any applicable Laws) to consummate and make effective, as soon as
reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall prohibit AirTran from taking any
action expressly contemplated by _Section 5.6_ and (ii) this  _Section 6.4_
shall not be deemed to change the specific standard of conduct or level of
efforts explicitly required to be expended with respect to any particular
matter set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) If any Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed to become applicable to this
Agreement, the acquisition of shares of AirTran Common Stock or AirTran
Derivative Securities, the Merger, or the related voting power pursuant to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, AirTran and
Southwest shall take such commercially reasonable action as may be
necessary to render such statutes inapplicable to all of the foregoing or to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statutes on this
Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(c) In connection with and without limiting _Section 6.4(a)_, promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Southwest and AirTran
shall provide all necessary notices, applications, and requests to, and enter
into discussions with, the Governmental Authorities from whom consents or
nonactions are required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order
to obtain all such required consents or nonactions from such Governmental
Authorities and eliminate each and every other impediment that may be asserted
by such Governmental Authorities, in each case with respect to the Merger, so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable.

 

(d) Southwest and AirTran, each acting reasonably and in good faith, shall be
entitled to jointly participate in any Proceedings or negotiations with any
Governmental Authority (including the DOJ, DOT, FAA, or any court) relating to
a Proceeding in connection with antitrust, competition, trade regulation, or
any other matters relating to the Merger, including any decisions
about timing and strategy (which, in the case of litigation, includes a



 

-60-  decision to defend, settle, or not to pursue the litigation), in connection
with such Proceeding and any communications with any Governmental Authority
relating to any contemplated or proposed resolution of such Proceeding;
_provided_ , that Southwest shall be entitled to direct any such Proceedings
or negotiations with any Governmental Authority (including the DOJ, DOT, FAA,
or any court) relating to a Proceeding.

 

(e) In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of AirTran and Southwest shall:

declaration, notice, or filing and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of
any communication with any Governmental Authority regarding the Merger
(including with respect to any of the actions referred to in _Section
6.4(c)_), and permit the other to review (with the exception of the HSR Act
filing and Second Request production) and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other in
connection with, any such registration, declaration, notice, filing, or
communication; 

(iv) respond as promptly as practicable under the circumstances to any
inquiries received from any Governmental Authority or any other authority
enforcing applicable antitrust, competition, trade regulation, or similar Laws
for additional information or documentation in connection with antitrust,

(v) without limiting the generality of _Section 6.4(e)(iv)_, (A) use
reasonable best efforts to achieve Substantial Compliance as promptly as
practicable with any request for additional information or documentary

in conjunction with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "
_Second Request_ "), (B) certify Substantial Compliance with any Second
Request as promptly as practicable after the date of such Second Request, and

Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in _Section
6.4(c)_), (B) cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda,
white papers, filings, correspondence, or other written communications
explaining or defending this Agreement and the Merger, articulating any

party with copies of all correspondence, filings (with the exception of the
HSR Act filing and Second Request production), communications, and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof between it and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of any Governmental Authoritys staff, on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement and the Merger.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
_Section 6.4_ shall not be construed to require (i) Southwest or any
Southwest Subsidiary to (A) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and
agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets, or
businesses of Southwest, the Southwest Subsidiaries, or the Combined Company
that would materially impair the expected benefits (taken as a whole) as of
the date hereof of the Merger to Southwest, (B) terminate relationships or
contractual rights or obligations of Southwest, the Southwest

Southwest, the Southwest Subsidiaries, or the Combined Company that would
materially impair the expected benefits (taken as a whole) as of the date

restructuring of Southwest, the Southwest Subsidiaries, or the Combined
Company (or, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry
of an order or decree with any Governmental Authority) that would materially
impair the expected benefits (taken as a whole) as of the date hereof of the
Merger to Southwest or (ii) Southwest or any Southwest Subsidiary or AirTran
or any AirTran Subsidiary to undertake any other efforts or to take any other
action if the taking of such efforts or action would result in a Southwest
Material Adverse Effect or be reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially impair the ability of Southwest or Merger
Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or a AirTran Material Adverse
Effect or be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent
or materially impair the ability of AirTran to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as applicable.

(g) AirTran shall give prompt notice to Southwest, and Southwest shall give
prompt notice to AirTran, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (ii) the material failure by it to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; _provided further_ , that a failure to comply with this _Section
6.4(g)_ will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _ARTICLE

independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _ARTICLE VII_
to be satisfied.



 

-62- 6.5 _Transaction Litigation_. AirTran shall provide Southwest with prompt
notice of, and copies of all pleadings and correspondence relating to, any
Proceeding against AirTran, any of the AirTran Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective directors or officers by any stockholder, debtholder, or other
stakeholder of AirTran arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. AirTran shall give Southwest the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement, or compromise of any
such Proceeding, and no such settlement or compromise shall be agreed to
without the prior written consent of Southwest, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. For purposes of this paragraph
"participate" means that Southwest will be kept apprised of proposed strategy
and other significant decisions with respect to the Proceeding by AirTran (to
the extent the attorney-client privilege between AirTran and its counsel is
not undermined or otherwise affected), and Southwest may offer comments
or suggestions with respect to the Proceeding but will not be afforded any
decision making power or other authority over the Proceeding except for the
settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

expenses) actually incurred by AirTran and its Affiliates in connection with
any action taken by AirTran or its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section
6.6_. Southwest shall pay to AirTran such fees and expenses as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within one Business Day) following receipt by
AirTran of an invoice therefor. All such payments shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by
AirTran.



 

-63- 6.7 _Indemnification and Directors and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Southwest will and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of AirTran and the AirTran Subsidiaries pursuant to
(i) each indemnification agreement in effect between AirTran or any of the
AirTran Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party (each of which is listed in 
_Section 6.7(a)_ of the AirTran Disclosure Letter) and (ii) any
indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other charter or
organizational documents of AirTran or any of the AirTran Subsidiaries as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

(b) At the Effective Time, Southwest shall cause to be obtained a prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy (providing only
for the Side A coverage for the Indemnified Parties where the existing
policies also include Side B coverage for AirTran) for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable
as provided in AirTrans current directors and officers and fiduciary
liability insurance policies in effect as of the date of this Agreement with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement and the matters and actions
contemplated hereby). Such "tail" insurance policies shall be from an
insurance carrier with the same or a better credit rating as compared to
AirTrans current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
and fiduciary liability insurance and provide coverage through the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, so long as the aggregate premium is not
greater than 250% of the product of (x) the annual premium paid by AirTran for
its existing directors and officers liability insurance policy during 2010
and (y) six (i.e., the number of years during which the "tail" insurance
policy is to be in effect). In the event that such amount is insufficient for
such coverage then the Surviving Corporation shall spend up to that amount
to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. If for
any reason the Surviving Corporation fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policy at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Southwest
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for
a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the AirTrans
current directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of
the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in such policy, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Southwest shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best
efforts to purchase comparable directors and officers liability insurance
for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in AirTrans current directors and officers liability
insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Southwest or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
250% of the annual premium paid by AirTran for its existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy during 2010; and, _provided further_ that
in the event that such amount is insufficient for such coverage then the
Surviving Corporation shall spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser
coverage as may be obtained with such amount.



 

-64- (c) For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is or was an officer
or director of AirTran or any of the AirTran Subsidiaries at or at any time
prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be an " _Indemnified Party_ ".

 

(d) If Southwest or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation, or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Southwest or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.7_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.7_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of AirTran or any of the AirTran
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 

6.8 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Southwest, AirTran,
and Merger Sub each shall take all such steps as may be required to cause (a)
any dispositions of AirTran Common Stock (including AirTran Derivative
Securities) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, by each individual who will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to AirTran
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions of Southwest
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Southwest
Common Stock) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who may become subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to Southwest to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_. Subject to the terms of the AirTran CBAs and the terms
of the collective bargaining agreements and other labor union contracts
(including all amendments thereto) applicable to any employees of Southwest or
any Southwest Subsidiaries:

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, Southwest shall, or shall cause the Southwest
Subsidiaries to, provide the employees of AirTran or one of the AirTran
Subsidiaries who are employed by Southwest or one of the Southwest
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") and
their eligible spouses and dependents, as applicable, with either, or
a combination of, as determined in the sole discretion of Southwest and its
appropriate officers, (i) comparable types and levels of employee benefits
(including salary, cash incentive compensation, severance, opportunities,
pension, welfare, travel, and other benefits) as those provided to similarly
situated employees of Southwest or the Southwest Subsidiaries and their
eligible spouses and dependents, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the
employee benefit arrangements of Southwest, including welfare benefit plans,
medical, dental, disability, and group life plans, and fringe benefit, travel,
Code Section 125, vacation, and sick leave plans or

 



 

-65-  benefits (such arrangements the " _Southwest Benefit Arrangements_ "), or
(ii) benefits under the material Current Employee Benefit Plans listed on
_Section 3.12(a)_ of the AirTran Disclosure Schedule that are maintained by
AirTran immediately prior to the Effective Time, all or some of which
Southwest may continue to sponsor on and after the Closing Date (to the extent
so continued or sponsored, the " _Continued Plans_ "). To the extent
Southwest elects to provide employee benefits to the Continuing Employees and
their eligible spouses and dependents, as applicable, pursuant to clause (ii)
above, the Continuing Employees shall be entitled to participate in the
Continued Plans from and after the Closing Date until such time that Southwest
suspends participation in or terminates such Continued Plans (the "
_Transition Period_ "). Upon the expiration of the Transition Period, the
Continuing Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents, as applicable,
shall then be entitled to participate in the Southwest Benefit Arrangement
comparable to any such Continued Plan and subject to the terms and conditions
of the applicable Southwest Benefit Arrangement. Southwest shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to take such action as Southwest reasonably deems
necessary so that Continuing Employees shall after the Effective Time continue
to be credited with the unused vacation and sick leave credited to such
employees through the Effective Time under the applicable vacation and sick
leave policies of AirTran or the AirTran Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and
Southwest shall permit or cause the Surviving Corporation to permit such
employees to use such vacation and sick leave in accordance with such policies
as are in effect at AirTran or the AirTran Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Southwest shall or shall cause a
Southwest Subsidiary to honor all commitments under the Current Employee
Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the AirTran Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) To the extent the Continuing Employees participate in a Southwest Benefit
Arrangement following the Effective Time, Southwest shall, or shall cause the
Southwest Subsidiaries to: (i) credit in full the service of each Continuing
Employee with AirTran or the AirTran Subsidiaries (or any predecessor
employer) prior to the Effective Time as service with Southwest and
the Southwest Subsidiaries only for purposes of vacation, Southwest service
awards, eligibility to participate in each Southwest Benefit Arrangement, and
vesting in retirement plans, other than (A) for defined benefit pension plan
accruals, (B) as would result in duplication of benefits, or (C) for any
Continuing Employee that is terminated and subsequently rehired only to the
extent required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
obligations in this  _clause (i)_ shall only be given from and to the extent
Southwest provides credit for similar service for Southwests own employees
for the applicable purposes, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion,
actively-at-work requirement, or waiting period to the extent such condition,
exclusion, requirement, or waiting period was satisfied or waived under the
comparable Current Employee Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time (or, if
later, any applicable plan transaction date), and (iii) in the plan year in
which participation in the Southwest Benefit Arrangement commences, provide
full credit for any co-payments, deductibles, or similar payments made or
incurred during such plan year prior to the date such participation
commences.

(c) Southwest shall, or shall cause a Southwest Subsidiary to, provide
lifetime travel benefits to AirTran Officers and members of the AirTran Board
(and their respective spouses, partners, dependants, and families) on
substantially the same basis as such benefits are provided to similarly
situated Southwest officers and directors (and their respective spouses,
partners, dependants, and families). Southwest shall, or shall cause a
Southwest Subsidiary to,

 



 

-66-  provide lifetime travel benefits to former AirTran Officers and former
members of the AirTran Board (and their respective spouses) pursuant to the
lifetime travel benefit arrangement sponsored or maintained by Southwest from
time to time, if any, to the extent such former officer or director is
eligible, immediately prior to the Effective Time, to participate in the
lifetime travel benefit arrangement sponsored or maintained by AirTran
on September 1, 2010.

(d) AirTran shall, as soon as practicable and in any case on or before
December 31, 2010, amend the AirTran Key Executive Retirement Plan (" _KERP_
") to provide that (i) calendar year 2010 and 2011 contributions to the KERP
will be calculated with respect to "Compensation" (as defined in the KERP)
received by the applicable participant in calendar year 2010 and will not
include any amount payable pursuant to an Employee Benefit Plan in connection
with the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement (whether occurring alone or in connection with
any other event) and (ii) calendar year 2011 contributions shall be pro rated
for, and based on, the number of days of service provided by the applicable
participant in calendar year 2011 prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Upon any integration of the operations of AirTran and Southwest at or
after the Effective Time, integration of the seniority of the two pilot
groups shall be effected in a fair and equitable manner, including, where
applicable, agreement through collective bargaining between Southwest and the
representative or representatives of the pilot groups involved. In the event
of a failure to agree pursuant to the foregoing, the dispute shall be resolved
in accordance with Section 13 of the Allegheny-Mohawk Labor Protective
Provisions.

 

(f) AirTran shall endeavor in good faith to cause the current officers of
AirTran (other than those scheduled to retire who are identified in _Section
5.2_ of the AirTran Disclosure Letter) to continue in employment after the
Effective Time and in any event for a period of at least six months following
the Effective Time.

 

(g) Southwest, Merger Sub, and AirTran hereby agree that none of the
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ is intended to, and does not, confer upon
any Person other than the parties to the Agreement any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to enforce any obligations of Southwest or the
Merger Sub contained herein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as requiring Southwest or any of the Southwest Subsidiaries to employ any
Continuing Employee for any length of time following the Closing Date. Except
as provided in the AirTran CBAs and the matters set forth on _Section 6.9(a)_
of the AirTran Disclosure Letter, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall be construed to prevent Southwest or any of the Southwest
Subsidiaries from (i) terminating, or modifying the terms of employment of,
any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date or (ii) terminating or
modifying to any extent any Current Employee Benefit Plan, Southwest Benefit
Arrangement, Continued Plan, or any other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement, or arrangement that Southwest or any of the Southwest Subsidiaries
may establish or maintain. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an
amendment to any Southwest Benefit Arrangement or Current Employee Benefit
Plan, or any other compensation and benefit plans maintained for or provided
to directors, officers, or employees of Southwest or AirTran or their eligible
spouses or dependents prior to or following the Effective Time.



 

-67- 6.10 _Publicity_. Except (a) with respect to any Adverse Recommendation
Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (b) with
respect to disclosures that are consistent with prior disclosures made in
compliance with this _Section 6.10_ or any communications plan or strategy
previously agreed on by the parties, Southwest and AirTran shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process, or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. The parties agree that all employee communication programs
or announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in forms agreed to by Southwest (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties.

6.11 _NYSE Listing_. Southwest shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Southwest Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be authorized for listing
on the NYSE upon official notice of issuance prior to the Effective Time.
Southwest shall use reasonable best efforts, and Southwest shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use reasonable best efforts, to cause the shares of
AirTran Common Stock to be no longer listed on the NYSE and de-registered
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

(a) In the event that:

 

(i)(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to AirTran and become
public before the AirTran Stockholders Meeting (other than by action of
Southwest or an Affiliate of Southwest) or shall have been made directly to
its stockholders generally following the date of this Agreement and in either
case remains in existence at least 10 Business Days prior to the time of the
relevant termination event, and thereafter (B) this Agreement is terminated by
AirTran or Southwest pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or _8.1(b)(iii)_ or by
Southwest pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, and (C) AirTran enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction
contemplated by, any Acquisition Proposal (replacing "15%" in the definition
thereof with "50%") within 12 months after the date this Agreement is
terminated;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Southwest pursuant to  _Section
8.1(c)(i)_ (or by Southwest or AirTran pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or

this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_); or 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by AirTran pursuant to _Section

then in any such event under _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ , or _(iii)_ of this

$39,000,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Any payment of the Termination Fee

made to Southwest concurrently with the earlier to occur of (x) entry into a
definitive agreement with respect to and (y) consummation of the transaction
contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal referred to therein; any payment of
the Termination Fee required to be made pursuant to _clause_



 

-72-   _(ii)_ of this _Section 8.3(a)_ shall be made to Southwest promptly
following termination of this Agreement by Southwest as set forth in such
_clause (ii)_ (and in any event not later than three Business Days after
delivery to AirTran of notice of demand for payment); and any payment of the
Termination Fee required to be made pursuant to _clause (iii)_ of this
_Section 8.3(a)_ shall be made to Southwest at the time provided for in
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_. All such payments shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Southwest.
AirTran hereby waives its right to set-off or counterclaim against the
requirement to pay the Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event will AirTran be obligated to pay more than one Termination Fee.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated. Other than any Taxes imposed upon a holder of
shares of AirTran Common Stock or AirTran Stock Options (which shall be paid
by or withheld on behalf of such holder), AirTran shall pay all Taxes incident
to preparing for, entering into, and carrying out this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) transfer, stamp, and documentary Taxes or fees and (ii) sales,
use, gains, real property transfer, and other or similar Taxes or fees.

 

(c) In the event that AirTran shall fail to pay the Termination Fee required
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ when due, such Termination Fee shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such Termination Fee became
past due, at a rate equal to the rate set forth in the New York edition of The
Wall Street Journal on such date under the "Treasurys" section for "1 Year
Note" plus 200 basis points. In addition, if AirTran shall fail to pay such
Termination Fee when due, AirTran shall also pay to Southwest all of
Southwests costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
efforts to collect such Termination Fee.

(d) AirTran acknowledges that the fees (including the Termination Fee) and
the other provisions of this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these
agreements, Southwest would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the
parties acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather a
reasonable amount that will compensate Southwest and Merger Sub for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Southwest and Merger Sub
hereby agree that if the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by
AirTran pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, the payment of such Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Southwest and Merger Sub (and their
Affiliates) against AirTran and any of its Affiliates or Representatives with
respect to the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that, AirTran will
not be relieved of any liability or damages to the extent set forth in
_Section 8.2(b)_.

 

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by Southwest, Merger Sub, and AirTran, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after the AirTran Stockholder Approval or the approval of Southwest as
stockholder of Merger Sub and before the Effective Time; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that after the AirTran Stockholder Approval, there may not be,
without



 

-73-  further approval of the stockholders of AirTran, any amendment of this
Agreement that decreases the amount or changes the form or mixture of the
consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of AirTran
Common Stock, or which by applicable Law otherwise requires the further
approval of the stockholders of AirTran. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Southwest
(on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) and AirTran may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by an
authorized officer on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement, or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

9.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined
terms, and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise
defined therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. Any agreement, instrument, or Law defined or referred to herein means
such agreement, instrument, or Law as from time to time amended, modified, or
supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America. The term "made
available" and words of similar import means that the relevant documents,
instruments, or materials were posted and made available to Southwest on the
Smith, Gambrell and Russell, LLP due diligence data site prior to the date of
this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor
of, or against, any of the parties to this Agreement by reason of the extent
to which any such party or its counsel participated in the drafting thereof or
by reason of the extent to which any such provision is inconsistent with any
prior draft of this Agreement, and no rule of strict construction will be
applied against any party hereto. The Southwest Disclosure Letter and the
AirTran Disclosure Letter, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits
hereto, will be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference
to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the inclusion of an item in either such disclosure schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event, or circumstance or
that such item has had or would result in a Southwest Material Adverse Effect
or AirTran Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. This Agreement will
not be interpreted or construed to require any Person to take any action, or
fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law.
References to the "other party" or "either party" will be deemed to refer to
Southwest and Merger Sub, collectively, on the one hand, and AirTran, on the
other hand. All electronic communications from a Person shall be deemed to be
"written" for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

-78- 9.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this _Section 9.5_ with respect thereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

9.6 _Counterparts; Method of Delivery_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by electronic mail in a PDF file shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement, and shall be
deemed to constitute due and sufficient delivery of such counterparts.

9.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur and the parties would not have an adequate
remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor and therefore fully intend for specific performance
to be the principal remedy for breaches of this Agreement. It is accordingly
agreed that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_ARTICLE VIII_ in accordance with the terms thereof the parties (on behalf of
themselves and in the case of AirTran, on behalf of its stockholders as third-
party beneficiaries as set forth in  _Section 9.8_ of this Agreement) shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement in any court referred to in  _Section 9.11_, without proof
of actual damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that
a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law,
or inequitable for any reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific
performance on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. Each party further acknowledges
and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.7_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement.
Each party further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person
shall be required to obtain, furnish, or post any bond or similar instrument
in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
this _Section 9.7_, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.



 

-79- 9.8 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, taken
together with the AirTran Disclosure Letter and the Southwest Disclosure
Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties any rights or remedies other than (i) as provided in _Section 6.7_
and (ii) the right of AirTran, on behalf of its stockholders as third-party
beneficiaries only to the extent specifically set forth herein, to pursue
damages and other relief, including equitable relief, in the event of fraud
or Southwests or Merger Subs intentional and material breach of this
Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Southwest and
Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights granted pursuant to this
clause (ii) shall be enforceable on behalf of holders of AirTran Common Stock
only by AirTran in its sole and absolute discretion, it being understood and
agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach to such shares
of AirTran Common Stock and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and,
consequently, any damages, settlements, or other amounts recovered or received
by AirTran with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by AirTran
in connection therewith) may, in AirTrans sole and absolute discretion, be
(x) distributed, in whole or in part, by AirTran to the holders of shares of
AirTran Common Stock of record as of any date determined by AirTran or (y)
retained by AirTran for the use and benefit of AirTran on behalf of its
stockholders in any manner AirTran deems fit. Each party agrees that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section 6.7_ shall not arise
unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

9.9 _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF

THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF SUCH CORPORATIONS, AND
(B) ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF, OR TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY, THIS AGREEMENT
THAT ARE EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE REQUIRED TO BE GOVERNED BY THE NRS).

9.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests,
or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without such consent
shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

9.11 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) agrees that any

States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and each agrees
that no such claim, action, suit, or other proceeding relating to this
Agreement will be brought by it or any of its affiliates except in such
court), subject to any appeal, _provided_ that if jurisdiction is not then
available in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, then any such claim, suit, action, or other proceeding may be
brought in any New



 

-80-  York State court sitting in New York County or any federal court located in
the State of New York, (b) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such claim, suit, action, or
other proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waives the defense of an

Agreement or any of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the Federal or state courts referenced above. Each of
the parties hereto further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice, or document by U.S.
registered mail to such Persons respective address set forth in _Section
9.2_ will be effective service of process for any claim, action, suit, or
other proceeding in New York with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding
sentence. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final judgment in any such
claim, suit, action, or other proceeding will be conclusive, subject to any
appeal, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by applicable Law. In connection with any such
proceeding that results in a judgment, the non-prevailing party will pay the
prevailing party its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with such proceeding.

9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ITS NEGOTIATION, OR ANY
OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER
