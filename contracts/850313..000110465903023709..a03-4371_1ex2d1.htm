 ** _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION_**

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this **"Agreement"** ) is made and
entered into on October 22, 2003, by and among SAFENET, INC., a Delaware

Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in **Exhibit
A**.

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the
**"Merger"** ) of Merger Sub into the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the

exist, and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

  



  

WHEREAS, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  **"Code"** );

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (i) has determined that the
Merger is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) has
approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement, (iii) has approved
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (i) has determined that the Merger
is in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders, (ii) has approved
and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) has determined to recommend that
the stockholders of Parent approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement (the recommendation
referred in this clause (iii) is referred to in this Agreement as the "
**Parent Recommendation** ");

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company listed on **Exhibit
B-1** (collectively, the **"Company Stockholders"** ) are entering into
Voting Agreements in the form of **Exhibit B-2 **(the **"Company Voting
Agreements"** ) pursuant to which the Company Stockholders have agreed to
vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and to take certain other actions in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement,
the Company and the stockholders of Parent listed in **Exhibit B-3** (the
**"Parent Stockholders"** ) **** are entering into Voting Agreements in
the form of **Exhibit B-4** (the **"Parent Voting Agreements")** pursuant
to which such Parent Stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares
of Parent Common Stock in favor of the issuance of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger and to take certain other actions in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

    **    
 **  



  

 **AGREEMENT**

  



  

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

  

# ** **

  

# **SECTION 1**. THE MERGER

  

## ** **

  

## **1.1** MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY.

  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.3_ ), Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the **"Surviving Corporation"** ) and will be a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

  

## ** **

  

## **1.2** EFFECT OF THE MERGER.

  



  

The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  

## ** **

  

## **1.3** CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME.

  



  

The consummation of the Merger (the **"Closing"** ) shall take place at the
offices of Venable LLP, 1800 Mercantile Bank and Trust Building, 2 Hopkins
Plaza, Baltimore, Maryland 21201 at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by
Parent (the **"Closing Date"** ), which date shall be no later than the
second business day after the conditions set forth in _Section 6_ shall have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions), or such other time as Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the certificate
of merger in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit C** (the **"Certificate of
Merger"** ), together with such other documents as may be required by the
relevant provision of the DGCL, shall be duly executed on behalf of
the Company and simultaneously with the Closing delivered to the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware for filing.  The Merger shall become
effective upon the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such other date and
time as may be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company and set forth
in the Certificate of Merger (the **"Effective Time"** ).

  

## ** **

  

## **1.4** CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS.

  



  

Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

  



  

(a) The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated immediately after the Effective Time to conform to the
certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"Rainbow Technologies, Inc."

  



  

(b) The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated
immediately after the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of the Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

2    **    
 **  



  

(c) The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

## **1.5** CONVERSION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company, subject to _Section_   _1.5(b)_ , each share of Company Common
Stock then issued and outstanding, other than Excluded Shares, if any, shall
be converted into 0.374 of a share (the " **Exchange Ratio** ") of Parent
Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock as set forth in _Section 1.5(c)_ , the "
**Merger Consideration** ").

  



  

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, including any such transaction with a record date
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, then the Exchange
Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent the record date for any
such event is between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, so
as to provide the holders of Company Common Stock and Parent the same
economic effect as contemplated prior to such stock split, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction.

  



  

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and
upon surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in
_Section 1.6_ ), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such stockholder
is entitled (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to such holder) by (B) the closing sales price of one (1)
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market (as
reported in the Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, any other
authoritative source) on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing
Date.

  

## ** **

  

## **1.6** CLOSING OF THE COMPANYS TRANSFER BOOKS.

  



  

At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock ( **"Shares"**
) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of
certificates representing Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the
Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 No further transfer of any such Shares shall be made on such stock transfer
books after the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, a valid
certificate previously representing any Shares (a **"Company Stock
Certificate"** ) is presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined in _Section
1.7_ ) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in this
_Section 1_.

  



  

3      
   



  

## **1.7** EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in the
Merger (the **"Exchange Agent"** ). Within five (5) business days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Shares, (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to this _Section 1_ , and (ii) cash sufficient
to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section
1.5(c)_ (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being referred to as the "
**Exchange Fund** ").

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent will mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably specify (including a provision
confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (A) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore the Merger
Consideration, and (B) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be
immediately canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.7_
, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any distribution or dividend the record date for which is
after the Effective Time. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates the
Merger Consideration; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing
Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver
a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

  



  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in
accordance with this _Section 1.7_.

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date one (1) year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company
Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this _Section 1.7_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto.

  



  

(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld,

  



  

4      
   



  

such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, properly delivered to any
public official in compliance with any applicable abandoned property law,
escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

  

## ** **

  

## **1.8** FURTHER ACTION.

  



  

If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by
Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and
otherwise) to take such action. Parent, Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation
also shall take such further actions as may be necessary or desirable to
ensure that the Exchange Agent sends out the letters of transmittal to the
stockholders of the Company and issues certificates representing Parent
Common Stock to such stockholders in accordance with _Section 1.7_.

  

## ** **

  

## **1.9** TAX CONSEQUENCES.

  



  

For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties
to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Treasury Regulations.

  

# ** **

  

# **SECTION 2.** REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except as disclosed in Company SEC Documents or the Disclosure Schedule
delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the **"Company Disclosure Schedule"** ) and
referred to in the section of the Company Disclosure Schedule corresponding
to the section(s) of this _Section 2_ to which such disclosure applies
(unless it is reasonably apparent that the disclosure or statement in one
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule should apply to one or more
sections thereof), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that:

Corporation Proprietary Assets necessary for the conduct of such Acquired
Corporations business as presently conducted, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. None of the Acquired Corporations has developed jointly with
any other Person any material Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset with
respect to which such other Person has any rights. Other than Contracts

exploit any Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset owned or exclusively
licensed by any of the Acquired Corporations.

  



  

(b) (i) To the Companys knowledge, all Acquired Corporation Proprietary

written notice of any actual, alleged, possible or potential infringement,
misappropriation or unlawful or unauthorized use of, any Proprietary Asset
owned or used by any other Person; (iv) to the Companys knowledge, the

Proprietary Asset of any other Person; and (v) to the Companys knowledge, no
other Person is infringing, misappropriating or making any unlawful or
unauthorized use of, and no Proprietary Asset owned or used by any other

of such Acquired Corporation have executed such an agreement.

  



  

(d) The Acquired Corporation Proprietary Assets owned by the Acquired

## ** **

  

## **2.10** GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS.

  



  

Each of the Acquired Corporations holds all Governmental Authorizations
necessary to enable such Acquired Corporation to conduct its business in the
manner in which such business is currently being conducted except where the

such Governmental Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect. Each
Acquired Corporation is in compliance in all material respects with the terms
and requirements of such Governmental Authorizations. None of the Acquired
Corporations has received any notice or other communication from any

13      
   



  

## **2.11** TAX MATTERS.

  



  

(a) The Acquired Corporations have paid or properly reserved for all Taxes,
due and payable by any of them for or with respect to all periods up to and
including the date hereof (without regard to whether or not such Taxes are or
were disputed), whether or not shown on any Tax Return.

  



  

(b) Each of the Acquired Corporations has filed on a timely basis (taking
into account any extensions of time an Acquired Corporation was granted) all
Tax Returns that it was required to file except for Tax Returns for the year
which includes the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns were accurate
and complete in all material respects. None of the Acquired Corporations is
currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return.  No claim that has not been resolved has ever been made to an
Acquired Corporation by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Acquired
Corporations do not file Tax Returns that any one of them is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. None of the Acquired Corporations
has given any currently effective waiver of any statute of limitations in
respect of Taxes or agreed to any currently effective extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency. There are no security interests on
any of the assets of any of the Acquired Corporations that arose in
connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax (other than
liens for Taxes not yet due and payable).

  



  

(c) The Acquired Corporations have withheld and paid all Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party
except for such withholding or payments to be made at or before Closing.

  



  

(d) None of the Acquired Corporations, including any director, officer or
employee responsible for tax matters of the Acquired Corporations is aware of
any facts or circumstances which could give rise to a reasonable expectation
that any relevant taxing authority may assess any additional Taxes for any
period for which Tax Returns have been filed. There is no dispute or claim
concerning any liability for Taxes of the Acquired Corporations either (i)
claimed or raised by any authority in writing or (ii) as to which
such Acquired Corporation has knowledge based upon personal contact with any
agent of such authority. Schedule 2.11(d) to the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth as of the date of this Agreement a complete and accurate list of
current open audits of Tax Returns filed by or on behalf of the Acquired
Corporations with any Governmental Body.

  



  

(e) The unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Corporations (i) did not, as of the date
of the most recent Company Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax
Liability (as opposed to any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth in the
Company Balance Sheet and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the
passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom
and practice of the Acquired Corporations in filing their Tax Returns.

  



  

(f) None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to any Tax allocation or
sharing agreement. None of the Acquired Corporations has made any
distribution of any "Controlled Corporation" as that term is defined
in Section 355(a)(1) of the Code. None of the Acquired Corporations (i) has
been a member of an "affiliated group," as defined in Section 1504(a) of the

except for Tax Returns for the year which includes the Closing Date.  All
such Tax Returns were accurate and complete in all material respects. None of
the SafeNet Corporations is currently the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim that has not
been resolved has ever been made to a SafeNet Corporation by an authority in
a jurisdiction where the SafeNet Corporations do not file Tax Returns that
any one of them is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. None
of the SafeNet Corporations has given any currently effective waiver of any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any currently
effective extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.
There are no security interests on any of the assets of any of the SafeNet
Corporations that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure)
to pay any Tax (other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable).

  



  

(c) The SafeNet Corporations have withheld and paid all Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party
except for such withholding or payments to be made at or before Closing.

  



  

(d) None of the SafeNet Corporations, including any director, officer or
employee responsible for tax matters of the SafeNet Corporations is aware of
any facts or circumstances which could give rise to a reasonable expectation
that any relevant taxing authority may assess any additional Taxes for any
period for which Tax Returns have been filed. There is no dispute or claim
concerning any liability for Taxes of the SafeNet Corporations either
(i) claimed or raised by any authority in writing or (ii) as to which such
SafeNet Corporation has knowledge based upon personal contact with any agent
of such authority. Schedule 3.11(d) to the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets
forth as of the date of this Agreement a complete and accurate list of
current open audits of Tax Returns filed by or on behalf of the SafeNet
Corporations with any Governmental Body.

  



  

(e) The unpaid Taxes of the SafeNet Corporations (i) did not, as of the date
of the most recent Parent Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax
Liability (as opposed to any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth in the
Parent Balance Sheet and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the
passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom
and practice of the SafeNet Corporations in filing their Tax Returns.

  



  

(f) None of the SafeNet Corporations is a party to any Tax allocation or
sharing agreement. None of the SafeNet Corporations has made any distribution
of any "Controlled Corporation" as that term is defined in Section 355(a)(1)
of the Code. None of the SafeNet Corporations (i) has been a member of an
"affiliated group," as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code, filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return other than an affiliated group the
common parent of which is Parent or (ii) has any Liability for the Taxes of
any Person (other than any of the SafeNet Corporations) under Treas. Reg.
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law),
as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

  



  

(g) None of the SafeNet Corporations has filed a consent under Section 341(f)
of the Code concerning collapsible corporations. None of the SafeNet
Corporations will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude
any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period or portion
thereof ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method
of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
under Section 481 of the Code, (ii) closing agreement as described in Section
7121 of the Code executed on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) deferred
intercompany gain or any excess loss account described in regulations under
Section 1502 of the Code or (iv) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date.

information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the
Registration Statement, the Company Proxy Statement or the Parent Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as the case may

## **5.4** STOCK OPTIONS; EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

  

## ** **

  

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be assumed by Parent. As of the Effective Time,
each such Company Option shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option
to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount, at an exercise price
and subject to such terms and conditions determined as provided below. Except
as set forth in Section 5.4(b), each Company Option so assumed by Parent
shall be subject to, and exercisable and vested upon, the same terms and
conditions as under the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and the
applicable option and other related agreements issued thereunder, including
without limitation the maximum term of the Company Option and the provisions
regarding termination of the Company Option following a termination of
employment, except that (A) each assumed Company Option shall be exercisable
for, and represent the right to acquire, that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio; (B) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to
each assumed Company Option shall be an amount equal to (i) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent); and (C) references under the
Company Option to a termination of employment shall mean, on and after the
Effective Time, a termination of employment with the Surviving Corporation or
any SafeNet Corporation.

  



  

(b) Each Company Option that is assumed by Parent under Section 5.4(a) and
held by an individual who is immediately prior to the Effective Time an
employee (including an officer) of any Acquired Corporation shall become
fully vested and exercisable in the event that the individuals employment is
terminated by Surviving Corporation or any SafeNet Corporation without
"cause" between the Effective Time and the first anniversary thereof. If such
stock option holder is a party to a written employment agreement which
contains a definition of "cause", then "cause" for purpose of this Section
5.4(b) shall be determined according to the terms of and in a manner
consistent with the provisions of such written employment agreement. If such
stock option holder is not party to such a written employment agreement, then
for purposes of this Section 5.4(b), "cause" shall mean (i) the willful and
repeated failure to perform his or her duties (as determined in good faith by
Parent) after such option holder has received a written demand for
performance specifically setting forth the factual basis for such belief,
after which such option holder shall have fifteen days to cure such
deficiency; (ii) any act of dishonesty or bad faith with respect to
the Surviving Corporation or any SafeNet Corporation that merits termination
of employment (as determined in good faith by Parent); (iii) or the
conviction of or plea of nolo contendere to any felony.  The accelerated
vesting provided in this section shall be in addition to, and not by way of
limitation of, any rights to accelerated vesting of the respective stock
option under its governing documents.

  



  

51      
   



  

(c) The Companys Board of Directors, or its duly appointed committee to
administer the Company Stock Option Plans, shall adopt resolutions, effective
contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
immediately prior to the Closing Date, to provide for the application of
_Section 5.4(a) and (b)_  to Company Options outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _ _The conversion of Company Options provided for in _Section 5.4(a)_
shall, with respect to any options which are intended to be "incentive stock
options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), be effected in a
manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

  



  

(e) Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation
will, from and after the Effective Time, for a period of not less than two
(2) years, maintain (i) the Company medical, dental, vision, flexible
spending, employee assistance, life insurance, disability insurance,
educational assistance, vacation, and holiday programs as described or
referenced on Schedule 2.12(a), or provide comparable or equivalent programs
on a plan by plan or program by program basis (as the case may be), and (ii)
the Companys 401(k) Plan Matching Contribution level currently in effect as
of the date of execution of this Agreement. Thereafter, in the event that such
Company programs are terminated, the employees of the Surviving Corporation
shall become participants in replacement Surviving Corporation and/or Parent
benefit arrangements, which shall be comparable and no less favorable to the
benefit arrangements provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. At
such time as the Surviving Corporation employees commence participation in
replacement plans of the Surviving Corporation and/or Parent, the following
shall apply: (i) Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause
to be provided that under each employee benefit plan, policy, program or
arrangement where service is relevant to a determination of an employees
eligibility to participate, vesting, or level or amount of benefits (other
than benefit accruals under a pension plan), employees of the Company who
become employees of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall be credited
with their period of service with the Company prior to the Closing, to the
extent permitted by applicable law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, and subject to any generally applicable break in service or
similar rules; (ii) subject to the approval of any insurance carrier and to
the extent consistent with applicable law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall make available, or
cause to be made available, to those employees of the Company who become
employees of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation, employee benefit plans and
programs, without regard to any preexisting condition limitation, actively-at-
work requirement or similar limitation, provided, and only to the extent,
that any analogous restriction applied to such employee under an analogous
Company Employee Plan had been satisfied as of such date; and (iii) in
determining any such employees share of the cost of coverage under any plan
or program of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation for the year in which the
participation begins, Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the employee with any co-pays and
deductibles made by or on behalf of such employee under each comparable
Company Employee Plan for such year.

  



  

(f) It is expressly understood and agreed that (i) the provisions of Section
5.4(e) are statements of intent, (ii) no employee of the Surviving
Corporation shall have rights or remedies, including rights of enforcement,
with respect thereto and (iii) no employee of the Surviving Corporation is or
is intended to be a third party beneficiary thereof. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 5.4(e), Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall not be
prohibited or restricted from amending, suspending or terminating any of its
employee benefit plans or the Company Employee Plans following the Effective
Time or terminating any of its employees or modifying their pay or employee
benefits following such date.

(ii) those Persons who have indemnification agreements with the Company as of
the date of this Agreement, for acts and omissions occurring prior to or at
the Effective Time, as provided in the Company Organizational Documents and
under each indemnification agreement with the Indemnified Persons to which
the Company is a party (as each is in effect as of the date of this
Agreement), to continue in effect after the consummation of the Merger for a
period of six (6) years from the date of this Agreement. The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions
with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as
favorable to those contained in the Company Organizational Documents, which
provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Persons, unless such
modification is required by applicable Legal Requirements.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, provide for officers
and directors liability insurance for the benefit of each Person (other than
the Company) named as an insured party in any officers and directors
liability insurance policy held by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (the " **Insured Parties** "), on terms with respect to such
coverage no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement, covering only those acts or omissions occurring prior to or
at the Effective Time; provided that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to maintain such policies to the extent the
cost of maintaining the same shall exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate, in
which case Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain as much
comparable insurance as can be obtained for such amount. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable actions requested by
Parent to maintain such directors and officers liability insurance.

shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and the Insured Parties and
their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and
the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns. In the event
Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their successors and assigns)
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successor or assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, honors the obligation set forth with respect to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this _Section 5.5_.

  



  

## **5.6** ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.

efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger.
