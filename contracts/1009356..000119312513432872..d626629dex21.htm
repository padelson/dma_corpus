Section 2.3(b), after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon
Parents request, cause the directors elected or designated by Parent to the
Company Board to serve on and constitute the same percentage as such
individuals represent of the entire Company Board (but not less than a
majority), rounded up to the next whole number, of: (i) each committee of the
Company Board and (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) and each
committee thereof (or similar body) of the Company Subsidiary, in each case
to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of NASDAQ. The
provisions of this Section 2.3(a) are in addition to, and shall not limit, any
rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates may have
as a record holder or beneficial owner of Company Common Stock as a matter of
applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. The
Companys obligations to appoint or elect Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. At the request of Parent, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to effect any such appointment or election of Parents
designees, including mailing to the Stockholders the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder,
which, unless Parent otherwise elects, shall be so mailed together with the
Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company, and be solely responsible
for, all information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and
Affiliates as is required by such Section and Rule.

 

(b) After Parents designees are appointed or elected to, and constitute a
majority of, the Company Board pursuant to Section 2.3(a), and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least
three directors who are members of the Company Board on the date hereof, each
of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of
the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ rules and at least one of whom
shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)
of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_
"); _provided_ that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced below
three for any reason, the remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to
elect or designate an individual meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such
vacancy, which individual shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for
purposes of this Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the
other directors shall designate three persons meeting the foregoing criteria
to fill such vacancies, and such individuals shall be deemed to be

 



17  Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement. The Company and the
Company Board shall promptly take all action as may be necessary to comply
with their obligations under this Section 2.3(b). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees
are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 2.3(a), the approval of a majority of such Continuing
Directors (or the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one
Continuing Director) shall be required in order to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any amendment or
termination of this Agreement, (ii) any waiver or exercise of any of the
Companys rights under this Agreement, (iii) any amendment of the Company
Charter Documents or (iv) any other action of the Company Board under or in
connection with this Agreement if such action would materially and
adversely affect, or would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect, the Stockholders (other than Parent or Merger Sub). For purposes of
considering any matter set forth in this Section 2.3(b), the Continuing
Directors shall be permitted to meet without the presence of the other
directors. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such
counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors
at the expense of the Company as may be determined by the Continuing
Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of
the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the Companys
rights hereunder.

ARTICLE 4

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 4.1. _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, each share of Merger Sub capital stock will be converted
into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



19 SECTION 4.2. _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any Stockholder:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any shares to be canceled pursuant
to Section 4.2(b) and (ii) any Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of either a certificate representing any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares representing
such shares of Company Common Stock (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section
4.3, without interest.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and shall
cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

SECTION 4.3. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which shall
provide for the payment by the Paying Agent of the amounts payable under
Section 4.2(a) in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.3. Parent shall
cause Intermediary to deposit with the Paying Agent in accordance with this
Article 4 the amount of cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by
this Article 4, and to the extent that there are net losses with respect to
any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses,
which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. No
investment of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the
Paying Agent will be payable to Parent.

 



20 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates and to each
holder of record of Book-Entry Shares, in each case whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 4.2(a), (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with
respect thereto. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal or receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate or book-entry entitle such holder to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 4 and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 4. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-
Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and the Person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 4 shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates or book
entries, and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 4,
except as otherwise provided by applicable Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or one of its
Affiliates, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall

 



21  thereafter look only to Intermediary and Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) for payment
of their claim for Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Intermediary, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the
earlier of (i) two years after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior
to the date on which the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or book entry
pursuant to this Article 4 would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Authority, then any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, subject to such Persons
compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in Section 4.3(b) (other
than the surrender of a Certificate), issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate in accordance
with this Article 4.

SECTION 4.4. _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Stock Options_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof (and, in
any event, prior to the Acceptance Time), the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required
consents from holders of Company Stock Options) as may be required to
provide that (i) each holder of an option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall be provided with
notice pursuant to which all outstanding Company Stock Options held by such
holder shall become fully vested and may be exercised by such holder prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable award agreement and Stock Plan under which such Company Stock
Option was granted and (ii) to the extent that any outstanding Company Stock
Option is not so exercised on or prior to the Effective Time, such Company
Stock Option shall be canceled, terminated and converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price
of such Company Stock Option by (B) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Stock Option (assuming full vesting of the
Company Stock Option) had such holder exercised the Company Stock Option in
full immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except as otherwise provided
below, any consideration due and owing pursuant to this Section 4.4(a) shall
be paid, without interest, within three Business Days after the Closing Date.

 



22 (b) _ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof (and, in any
event, prior to the Acceptance Time), the Company Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof administering the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to
the ESPP, (i) participation following the date hereof shall be limited to
those employees who participated in the ESPP immediately prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, (ii) participants may not increase
their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect
immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (unless
otherwise required by the Code), (iii) no Offering Period (as defined in the
ESPP) shall commence after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and (iv) each participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate no later than immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 4.5. _Further Action_. The parties agree to take all necessary action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Offer Closing without a meeting of the Stockholders, as provided in Section
251(h) of the DGCL.

SECTION 4.6. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, (i) in the event that, during the period between
the date hereof and the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number of shares or securities or a different class, including as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, issuance pursuant to the Rights Agreement or other similar
transaction, then the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to reflect such change and (ii) if any Company Rights are
exercised or any dividends or distributions are made, set aside, paid or
declared with respect to the Companys Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, then the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ that, in any case,
nothing in this Section 4.6 shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

 

SECTION 4.7. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 



23 SECTION 4.8. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration and
shall entitle the holder only to payment for such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ that if, after the Effective Time, any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then such Appraisal Shares shall automatically
be converted as of the Effective Time into, and become exchangeable solely for
the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 4.2(a). The
Company shall promptly serve notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any
cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 4.3(a) with respect
to shares of Company Common Stock that become Appraisal Shares shall be
returned to Parent upon demand therefor.

ARTICLE 5

Subsidiary. No Company Subsidiary owns any Company Common Stock or Company
Securities.

 

SECTION 5.3. _Authorization; No Conflict_.

 

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority, and has taken
all corporate action necessary, to execute, deliver and perform its

Board unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions
are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Stockholders, (ii)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, (iii)
resolved, subject to Section 7.8, to recommend that the Stockholders accept
the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and (iv) to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect
of causing this Agreement and the Transactions not to be subject to any
Takeover Provision that might otherwise apply to the Transactions. None of
the foregoing resolutions of the Company Board have been amended, rescinded or

and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and
Merger Sub, is enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium

 



26  or similar Laws of general application affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and equitable principles of general
applicability (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ "). Assuming the
Transactions are consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, no
stockholder votes or consents are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions.

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions nor compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions herein will (i) result in a violation or
breach of, contravene or conflict with the Company Charter Documents or the
Company Subsidiary Charter Documents, (ii) assuming compliance with the

are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing Commitment at the Closing, other than the

condition set forth in the Financing Commitment that is required to be
satisfied by it on or prior to the Closing.

(c) At the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, Parent will have
available, and will make available to Merger Sub (through Intermediary), all

acknowledge that their obligations under this Agreement are not contingent or
conditioned in any manner on obtaining any funds or financing.

 

SECTION 6.8. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this
Agreement, none of

 



55  Parent, Merger Sub and any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent, Merger Sub, their

(xiii) incur any capital expenditures or any obligations or liabilities in
respect thereof, except for (A) those contemplated by Section 7.1(b)(xiii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter and (B) those that, when added to all other
capital expenditures made on behalf of the Company and the Company Subsidiary
since the date hereof but not provided for in Section 7.1(b)(xiii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, do not exceed $100,000 individually or $500,000 in
the aggregate during any calendar quarter;

 

(xiv) except as contemplated by this Agreement, amend the Rights Agreement,
redeem the Company Rights or take any action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the Rights Agreement; or

(xv) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall give to Parent
or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the
operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiary prior to the Acceptance
Time.

SECTION 7.2. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Until the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent agrees to
provide each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiary who is
located in the United States and retained by Parent with (i) the same level of
base salary and hourly wage rate, as applicable, (ii) the same level of target
bonus opportunity or sales incentive, as applicable, and (iii)
employee benefits (excluding equity plans) that are (1) comparable in the
aggregate to those benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time or (2) comparable in the aggregate to the benefits Parent
provides to its similarly situated employees; _provided_ that Parent shall be
under no obligation to retain any employee or group of employees of the
Company or the Company Subsidiary other than as required by applicable Law or
an employment agreement listed in Section 7.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(b) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), in which an
employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Closing (a " _Company Employee_ ") is eligible to participate, Parent shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause each such plan, program or
arrangement to treat the prior service with the Company and its Affiliates of
each Company Employee (to the same extent such service is recognized under
existing analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing) as service rendered to Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate
in and vesting thereunder (but not for purposes of benefit accrual with
respect to any defined benefit pension plans); _provided_ that such crediting
of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of
such benefit to such Company Employee. Company Employees shall also be given
credit for any deductible, co-payment

 



59  amounts or maximum out-of-pocket requirements paid in respect of the plan
year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing,
they participate in any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments are
required, or maximum out-of-pocket requirements are in place. Parent shall
also use reasonable best efforts to cause each employee benefit plan
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) in which Company
Employees participate to waive any preexisting condition and actively at work
requirements that were waived under the terms of any Company Employee Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Closing or waiting period limitation which
would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee on or after the Closing.
Parent shall recognize any accrued but unused vacation and sabbatical time of
the Company Employees as of the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
the Company policies listed on Section 7.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and Parent shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary to provide such
vacation and sabbatical time in accordance with the terms of such Company
policies but in no event will Parent be obligated to extend or enlarge the
benefits available under such Company policies. At least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall confirm in writing to Parent
the amount of accrued and unpaid days of vacation and sabbatical time
applicable to each Company Employee. Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall prevent
Parent from amending or terminating any Company Employee Benefit Plan or other
benefit plan, arrangement, or agreement covering any Company Employee in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.2 shall in no event apply to any
employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiary whose employment has been
terminated and who is later employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

(d) The parties will cooperate in good faith with regard to any notification
that may be required by the WARN Act or other similar applicable Law as a
result of the Transactions.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate the Stock Plans, the ESPP, the Executive Nonqualified Excess
Plan and the Companys 401(k) Plan, with such terminations to be effective the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date, in each case, in accordance with
terms of such plan and applicable Law. 

(f) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause one
or more defined contribution savings plans intended to qualify under Sections
401(a) and 401(k) of the Code and sponsored or maintained by Parent
(collectively, the " _Parent Savings Plans_ ") to provide for the receipt of
lump sum cash distributions of each employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiary who is located in the United States, in the form of an eligible
rollover distribution from the Companys 401(k) Plan, provided such rollovers
are made at the election of such employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiary and in accordance with the terms of the applicable Parent Savings
Plan. The Company shall cause the Companys 401(k) Plan to permit such
employees to elect a lump sum cash distribution of benefits accrued through
the Closing Date in accordance with the Code. Parent shall cause the Parent
Savings Plans to accept

 



60  rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), including the amount of any unpaid
balance of any participant loan, from the Companys 401(k) Plan.
Notwithstanding this Section 7.2(f), the Parent Savings Plans shall not accept
rollovers from Roth accounts.

 

SECTION 7.3. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, if any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and the Company Subsidiary, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Company, the Company Subsidiary or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company, the Company Subsidiary or Merger Sub, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

SECTION 7.4. _Public Statements_. The initial press release to be issued with
respect to the Transactions shall be a joint press release in a form agreed by
the parties. Thereafter, no public release or announcement concerning the
Transactions shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent
of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental
Authority to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever
situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance,
it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, including the Companys obligations under Section
2.2 and Section 7.8, each party may, without complying with the
foregoing obligations, make any public statement regarding the Transactions
in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and
make disclosures in Company SEC Reports, to the extent that such statements
are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with
this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in
this Section 7.4 shall not apply to any release or announcement made or
proposed to be made by the Company pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or following a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, so long as any public statement in
connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is made in compliance
with Section 7.8.

 



61 SECTION 7.5. _Standard of Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided herein (including the
limitations set forth in Section 7.5(d)), each party agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make

later than November 22, 2013, or at such time as mutually agreed by the

and to obtain any clearance, approval or consent under any other applicable
Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable.

 

(c) Each party will (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Transactions, (ii)
promptly notify the other party of any communication received from, or given
to, any Governmental Authority and/or third party with respect to the
Transactions, (iii) subject to applicable Law, permit the other party to

appropriate by Parent and Merger Sub, and incorporate the other partys
reasonable comments, (iv) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting
or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Transactions unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and (v) furnish the other party with non-confidential copies of
all correspondence, filings and written communications between them and their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one hand, and any such
Governmental Authority or its staff on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 



62 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.5 or any other
provision of this Agreement, (i) nothing in this Section 7.5 shall limit any
applicable rights a party may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1 so long as such party has up to then complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this Section 7.5 and (ii) in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to offer, accept or agree to, and the

Subsidiaries), except with respect to any requirement to divest, dispose of

the aggregate (together with any limitations contemplated by clause (C)) are
non-material to the Company and the Company Subsidiary taken as a whole, (C)
restrict, prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries of all or any portion of the business
or assets of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in any part of the world, except with respect
to limitations on such ownership or operation with respect to the business or
assets only of the Company or the Company Subsidiary that in the aggregate
(together with any divestitures, dispositions or hold separate arrangements
contemplated by clause (B)) are non-material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiary taken as a whole, (D) cause Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
divest any shares of Company Common Stock or (E) impose limitations on the

including the right to vote the Company Common Stock acquired or owned by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on all matters properly presented to the
Stockholders.

SECTION 7.6.  _Notification of Certain Matters; Other Actions_.

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to
the others upon becoming aware of (i) any Proceedings commenced or, to such

Effect or the occurrence or existence of any event which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse

remedies available hereunder to the Company or Parent. __

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall (i) provide Parent with any

participate as an observer in any meetings or conference calls the Company has

64 SECTION 7.7. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiary and the
Representatives of the Company and the Company Subsidiary to, afford
to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access
upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours from the date
hereof through the Effective Time to its officers, employees, agents,
properties, facilities, books, records, Contracts and other assets and shall
promptly furnish to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives
all financial, operating and other data and information as such Persons may
from time to time reasonably request. Parent and Merger Sub shall have the
right to make such due diligence investigations as Parent and Merger Sub shall
deem necessary or reasonable, upon reasonable notice to the Company and
without significant interference to Companys operations or properties. The
Company shall instruct its Representatives to cooperate with Parent and Merger
Sub in their investigation of the Company and the Company Subsidiary. All
access and investigations pursuant to this Section 7.7(a) shall be conducted
at Parents expense and under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the
Company and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiary.
No additional investigations or disclosures shall affect the Companys
representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(c) Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information to
Parent if such disclosure would, in the Companys reasonable discretion (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ that the Company will nonetheless provide Parent with
appropriate information regarding the factual basis underlying
any circumstances that resulted in the preparation of such privileged
analyses) or (ii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding
Contract entered into prior to the date hereof, including any confidentiality
agreement to which the Company or the Company Subsidiary is a party (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of any such Contracts counterparty to such inspection or
disclosure). The Company and Parent will each use commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 

SECTION 7.8. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) At all times during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not (and
shall cause the Company Subsidiary not to), nor shall it authorize and it
shall cause their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate, propose or take any action to knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the submission
of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
an

 



65 _ _ Acquisition Proposal or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or
attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish
to any Person any information or data relating to, afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary in connection with, or otherwise cooperate with any Person with
respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) grant
any waiver, amendment or release of or under, or fail to enforce,
any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement (or any confidentiality,
standstill or similar provision of any other Contract) or take any action to
exempt any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) or any action taken
by any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) from the Rights
Agreement or any Takeover Provision or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing; _provided_ that if in response to an unsolicited, _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof in
circumstances not involving a breach of this Section 7.8, the Company Board
determines in good faith (based on information then available to it and after
consultation with outside counsel and receiving the advice of its financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal
and with respect to which the Company Board determines in good faith, based
on information then available to it and after consulting with and receiving
the advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
Stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company may at any time prior to
the Offer Closing (but in no event after such time), furnish information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiary to, or enter into
discussions with, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives; _provided_ that (1) at least 12 hours prior to furnishing any
such information to, or entering into discussions with, such Person, Parent
receives written notice from the Company of the identity of such Person and
of the Companys intention to furnish information to, or enter into
discussions with, such Person, and the Company receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement in a customary form that is no
less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement and (2) the
Company concurrently furnishes all such information provided to such Person to
Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished or
made available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not provide any commercially
sensitive non-public information to any competitor, except in a manner
consistent with the Companys past practices in dealing with the disclosure
of such information in the context of considering Acquisition Proposals prior
to the date hereof. The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are
aware of the provisions of this Section 7.8(a). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by
the Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.8 by the Company.
The Company shall provide Parent with an accurate and complete copy of any
confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this Section 7.8(a) within
24 hours of the execution thereof. The Company shall not terminate, waive,
amend, release or modify any material provision of any such confidentiality
agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may in any event have
discussions with any Person that has made an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal in order to (i) clarify and understand the terms and __

 



66 _ _ conditions of the Acquisition Proposal made by such Person and to
determine whether the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) inform such Person of the
provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ that at least 12 hours prior to
having such discussions with such Person, Parent receives written notice from
the Company of the identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to
have discussions with such Person. __

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 7.8, the Company shall as promptly as possible, and in any event no
later than 24 hours after receipt thereof, advise Parent, orally and in
writing, of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
expressly contemplates or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or
offer, the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal, proposal or
offer (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms
and conditions) or the nature of any inquiries or other contacts, and provide
to Parent copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such inquiry, proposal or offer, and thereafter the Company
shall (i) keep Parent (or its outside counsel) reasonably and promptly
informed regarding the progress of developments affecting the status
and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer and
regarding the status of any discussions or negotiations with the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer or any of its
Representatives and (ii) provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies
of any additional written materials received that relate to such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer within 24 hours after receipt or delivery
thereof.

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by Section 7.8(d), neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold, fail to include in (or
remove from) the Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly
propose or resolve to withhold, fail to include in (or remove from) the
Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend, submit to the
Stockholders or declare advisable (or resolve, determine or propose to adopt,
approve, recommend, submit to Stockholders or declare advisable) any
Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, approve,
recommend, submit to Stockholders or declare advisable (or resolve, determine
or propose to adopt, approve, recommend, submit to Stockholders or declare
advisable), or allow the Company or the Company Subsidiary to execute or enter
into, any Contract constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could
be reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or requiring or
reasonably likely to cause the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with, the Transactions (any such Contract, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 7.8(a) entered into in compliance with Section 7.8(a).

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.8, if at any
time during the Pre-Closing Period the Company receives an Acquisition
Proposal or an Intervening

 



67 _ _ Event occurs, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified
Agreement, in each case if, and only if, (i) the Company is not in breach of
this Section 7.8, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a Specified Agreement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Stockholders under applicable Law, (iii)
the Company has given Parent written notice of the Company Boards intention
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a Specified Agreement at least four Business Days prior to making
any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement
to enter into a Specified Agreement (a " _Change of Recommendation Notice_ "),
(iv) if the decision to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in
connection with an Intervening Event then the Company shall comply with
clauses (I) through (III) as follows: (I) the Change of Recommendation Notice
shall have provided a reasonable description of the Intervening Event and the
reasons for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (II) the Company
shall have given Parent a four Business Day period following Parents receipt
of the Change of Recommendation Notice to propose revisions to the terms of
this Agreement or make other proposals and shall have negotiated in good faith
with Parent (and caused its Representatives to negotiate with Parent) with
respect to such proposed revisions or other proposals, if any, and (III) after
considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into account
the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
Stockholders under applicable Law and (v) if the decision to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change is in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
if the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Specified Agreement, then the Company shall comply with clauses (A) through
(E) as follows: (A) prior to giving effect to clauses (B) through (E), the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (B) the
Company shall have provided to Parent in writing the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all material documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with this Section 7.8, (C)

Parents receipt of the Change of Recommendation Notice to propose revisions
to the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals and shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its Representatives to
negotiate with Parent) with respect to such proposed revisions or other
proposals, if any, (D) after considering the results of negotiations with
Parent and taking into account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Stockholders under applicable
Law and (E) if the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Specified Agreement, the Company shall comply with Section 9.1(d)(i). For __

 



68  clarity, the provisions of this Section 7.8(d) shall also apply to any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or any successive Acquisition
Proposals (except that any reference to four Business Days shall be two
Business Days). Neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted
to recommend that the Stockholders tender any securities in connection with

indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses,

whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in respect of this
Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, Judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred (and

such Indemnified Party of appropriate undertakings to repay such advanced
costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification);  _provided_ that if, at any time prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers
to Parent a written notice asserting in good faith a claim for indemnification
under this Section 7.9(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved; _provided further_ that nothing herein
shall impair any rights to indemnification of any Indemnified Party referred
to in Section 7.9(a).

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policies (accurate and complete
copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) in effect on the date
hereof (the " _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or
omissions prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or
officers so long as such substitution does not result in gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided further_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation
be required to pay annual premiums of more than an amount equal to 250 % of

Insurance, subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos above in this
Section 7.9(c), and such "tail" policy or policies shall satisfy the
provisions of this Section 7.9(c).

 



70 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
7.9 shall survive the Offer Closing and the consummation of the Merger and

Provision becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Support Agreement or the

effect as promptly as practicable but in any event no later than the Closing,
(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all Financing Conditions and (iv) in the event

to fund the Financing Commitment. If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable
best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Section 7.17(a),
the Financing Commitment (or any definitive financing agreement relating
thereto) expires or is terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part,
for any reason, including as a result of a breach or repudiation or if any
portion of the Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange for alternative financing in an amount
sufficient to pay for the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.17(a), Parent shall have the right from time to
time to amend, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights
under, the Financing

 



72  Commitment, or enter into other financing arrangements as an alternative to

amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or alternative if such amendment,
supplement, modification, waiver or alternative imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to
the Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision
of the Financing Commitment, in a manner that would (i) materially and
adversely affect the ability of Parent to fund its obligations when due under
this Agreement or (ii) materially and adversely affect the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights under the terms of the Financing Commitment or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto; _provided_ that, subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this Section 7.17, Parent may
amend the Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, and agents or in a
manner that would not materially adversely affect the ability of Parent to
fund its obligations when due under this Agreement (it being understood that
any such additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, and agents may have the
same rights under the Financing Commitments as those of Jefferies acting in
such capacity and Jefferies commitment may be assigned to any such Person as
contemplated in the Financing Commitment). Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Company copies of any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
alternative of a material nature.

 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of material developments
in respect of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company
copies of the executed material definitive agreements for the Financing
(excluding any agreement or portion thereof that by its terms is

give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any material breach or material
default by any party to any of the Financing Commitment or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the
receipt of any written notice from any Debt Financing Source with respect to
any actual or potential material breach, material default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitment or definitive
agreements related to the Financing or any provisions of the Financing
Commitment or definitive agreements related to the Financing and (iii) if at
any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith that it will not be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in
the manner or from the Debt Financing Sources contemplated by any of the
Financing Commitment or definitive agreements related to the Financing. As
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three Business Days
after the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request, Parent shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete
copies of all agreements, arrangements or understandings (including side
letters or (subject to customary redactions) fee letters) pursuant to which
any such alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of
the Financing.

Company Subsidiarys Affiliates and Representatives to cooperate with Parent

9.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the time specified in the
next sentence, a nonrefundable termination fee of $80 million (the "
_Termination Fee_ "). Any payment of the Termination Fee required to be made
pursuant to (1) Section 9.3(b)(i) shall be made to Parent within two Business
Days of the occurrence of the applicable event described in clause (B) of
Section 9.3(b)(i); (2) Section 9.3(b)(ii) shall be made to Parent within two
Business Days after termination of this Agreement by Parent as set forth in
Section 9.3(b)(ii) and (3) Section 9.3(b)(iii) shall be made to Parent
immediately prior to and as a condition to such termination of this Agreement
by the Company as set forth in Section 9.3(b)(iii). All payments under this
Section 9.3(b) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account to be designated by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Termination Fee under this Section 9.3 shall be payable only once and not
in duplication even though the Termination Fee may be payable under one or
more provisions hereof.

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 9.3(b)
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without those agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to make payment of any amount payable under Section 9.3(b)
within the applicable time period specified in Section 9.3(b) and Parent
commences a Proceeding to collect such amount that results in a judgment
against the Company, the Company shall reimburse Parent for its reasonable
fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred
in connection with such Proceeding and shall pay interest on the amount of the
payment at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date the amount was payable pursuant to Section 9.3(b), with such
interest to accrue beginning on the date such amount first was payable
pursuant to Section 9.3(b) to the date of payment.

SECTION 10.2. _Amendments and Waivers_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.3 and Section 7.9(d), any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of this Section 10.2, Section 10.4(c),
Section 10.7(b) and Section 10.12 (or the terms defined in this Agreement
insofar as they pertain to such Sections and any other provision of
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of such
Sections) may be amended, waived or modified in a manner adverse to any Debt
Financing Source Party without the prior written consent of (i) in the case
of a Debt Financing Source, such Debt Financing Source and (ii) in the case of
a Debt Financing Source Party (other than a Debt Financing Source), the Debt
Financing Source by reason of which such Person is a Debt Financing Source
Party.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any right, power or privilege.

 

SECTION 10.3. _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement and in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

 



82 SECTION 10.4. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Law of the State of Delaware regardless of the Law that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

(b) The parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the parties irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 10.1 shall
be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiary agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against a Debt Financing Source Party arising out of this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), and that the provisions of Section 10.5 (as in
effect on the date of this Agreement) shall apply to any such action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

SECTION 10.5. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS.

 

SECTION 10.6. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or .pdf shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

 



83 SECTION 10.7. _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. No
party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party,
except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
(i) one or more of their Subsidiaries at any time and (ii) after the Effective
Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter
or change any obligation of any other party or due to Parent or Merger Sub.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other
than the parties and their heirs, successors, Representatives and permitted
assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or
any provision hereof, and no person shall be a third party beneficiary by, in
or under this Agreement or any related document, except that (i) from and
after the Effective Time each Indemnified Party is an intended third party
beneficiary of Section 7.9 and such Persons may specifically enforce such
provisions, (ii) the Financing Indemnitees are intended third party
beneficiaries of Section 7.18(d) and such Persons may specifically enforce
such provisions and (iii) Section 10.2, Section 10.4(c), this clause (iii) of
this Section 10.7(b) and Section 10.12 are intended to be for the benefit of
each Debt Financing Source Party and may be directly enforced by such Debt
Financing Source Party. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute an
amendment to any employee benefit plan, program, or policy, and no such
employee benefit plan, program, or policy shall be treated as amended absent a
separate written amendment adopted in accordance with the amendment
procedures of the applicable plan, program, or policy.

SECTION 10.8. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

SECTION 10.9. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Support Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.10. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to 

 



84  enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.

SECTION 10.11. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

SECTION 10.12. _No Recourse Against Debt Financing Source Parties_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and
agree that (a) each Debt Financing Source and any arranger, book manager,
documentation agent, syndication agent, administrative agent, collateral
agent, or trustee that is a participant in the Financing and any of their
respective Representatives and Affiliates and each such entitys,
Representatives or Affiliates respective Affiliates, former, current or
future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents or the heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (each a " _Debt
Financing Source Party_ ") shall not have any liability or obligation to any
Person under this Agreement and (b) neither the Company nor the Company
Subsidiary (except insofar as either is a party to any agreement entered into
as part of the Financing) shall be entitled to any recovery, judgment
or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect or punitive
damages, against any Debt Financing Source Party, whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, in connection with this Agreement or the
Financing.

[Signature Page to Merger Agreement] ANNEX I

 

 _Offer Conditions_

 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer and in addition to Merger
Subs rights to extend, amend or terminate the Offer in accordance with the
provisions of the Agreement and applicable Law, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act, pay for any Tendered Shares, if any of the following events shall occur
and be continuing as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as
it may have been extended pursuant to Section 2.1(e) of the Agreement):

 

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that
number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the shares of
Company Common Stock then owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, would
represent one share more than one half of the sum of (i) all shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding and (ii) all shares of Company Common Stock
that the Company may be required to issue upon the vesting (including vesting
solely as a result of the consummation of the Offer), conversion, settlement
or exercise of all then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans,
obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Company
Common Stock, or other rights to acquire or be issued shares of Company Common
Stock (including all then outstanding Company Stock Options), regardless of
the conversion or exercise price or other terms and conditions thereof) (such
condition in this clause (a), the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

(b) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer
under the HSR Act shall not have been terminated or shall not have expired, or
any other clearance, approval or consent under any other applicable Antitrust
Law shall not have been obtained, in each case prior to the Expiration Date;

(c) there shall be any Law or Judgment enacted, enforced, amended, issued, in
effect or deemed applicable to the Offer, by any Governmental Authority
(other than the application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act or
of requirements for clearance, approval or consent under any other Antitrust
Law to the Offer or to the Merger), in any such case the effect of which is
to make illegal or otherwise prohibit the acceptance for payment of or payment
for shares of Company Common Stock or the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger;

 

(d) there shall be pending any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority (i)
challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger, (ii) seeking (A) to restrain, prohibit or limit Parents or its
Affiliates ownership or operation of the business of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary, or of Parent or its Affiliates, or (B) to compel Parent
or any of its Affiliates to divest, dispose of or hold separate all or any
portion of the business or assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiary or
of Parent or its Affiliates, in each case ((A) and (B)) in any manner or to
any extent not contemplated by Section 7.5, or (iii) seeking to impose or
confirm material limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of
the shares of Company Common Stock, including the right to vote shares of
Company Common Stock acquired or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on
all matters properly presented to the Stockholders;

 



I-1 (e) the Company and Parent shall have reached an agreement that the Offer or
the Agreement be terminated, or the Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms;

(f) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 5.1(a), Section 5.2, Section 5.3(a), Section 5.3(b)(i), Section
5.3(b)(ii), Section 5.10, Section 5.13 and Section 5.23 of the Agreement shall
not be true and correct in all respects (other than _de minimis_
inaccuracies) as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as
though made on and as of such date (except to the extent expressly made as of
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) or (ii) any
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement
(other than those listed in the preceding clause (f)(i)) shall not be true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation on any representation or
warranty indicated by the words "Company Material Adverse Effect," "in all
material respects," "in any material respect," "material" or "materially") as
of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on
and as of such date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), except, in the case of this
clause (f)(ii), where the failure of any such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct would not, and would not be reasonably expected to,
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(g) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply with in any material
respect any obligation, agreement or covenant required to be performed or
complied with by it under the Agreement prior to the Expiration Date;

(h) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred and be
continuing any event, condition, change, occurrence or development of a state
of facts that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

 

(i) Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the
Company to the effect that none of the conditions in paragraphs (f), (g), and
(h) of this Annex I shall have occurred and be continuing.

 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions, and may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time in their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Condition), in
each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

ARTICLE VII

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the

ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

(a) Subject to ARTICLE VIII(c), the Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or
in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good
faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did
not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that his or her conduct was unlawful.

 



A-2 (b) Subject to ARTICLE VIII(c), the Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of
the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that
he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement
of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or
she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or
suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall
deem proper.

 

(c) Any indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII (unless ordered by a court)
shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon
a determination that indemnification of the director or officer or other
person entitled to indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in ARTICLE VIII(a) or ARTICLE VIII(b), as the case may be. Such
determination shall be made, with respect to an officer or director, (i) by
the Board of Directors by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to
such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, (ii) by a
committee of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding
even though less than a quorum, (iii) if there are no such directors, or if
such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion,
or (iv) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a present or former
director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in ARTICLE
VIII(a) or ARTICLE VIII(b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter
therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys
fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith,
without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.

(d) Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under
ARTICLE VIII(c), and notwithstanding the absence of any determination
thereunder, any present or former director or officer of the Corporation may
apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for
indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under ARTICLE VIII(a) and
ARTICLE VIII(b). The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a
determination by such court that indemnification of such person is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standards of
conduct set forth in ARTICLE VIII(a) or ARTICLE VIII(b), as the case may be.
Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under ARTICLE VIII(c)
nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such
application or create a presumption that such person seeking indemnification
has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII(d) shall be given to
the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful,
in whole or in part, such person seeking indemnification in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware shall also be entitled to be paid the
expense of prosecuting such application.

 



A-3 (e) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a person who is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation in defending or investigating a
threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this ARTICLE
VIII.

 

(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this ARTICLE VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of
any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his or
her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the
persons specified in ARTICLE VIII(a) and ARTICLE VIII(b) shall be made to the
fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this ARTICLE VIII shall not
be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified
in ARTICLE VIII(a) or ARTICLE VIII(b) but whom the Corporation has the power
or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise.

(g) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or
her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or
the obligation to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of this ARTICLE VIII or Section 145 of the DGCL.

 

(h) For purposes of this ARTICLE VIII, references to "the Corporation" shall
include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent
corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had the power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so
that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII
with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have
with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued. For purposes of this ARTICLE VIII, references to "serving at the
request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such person with respect to an employee benefit plan, its
participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a
manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants
and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted
in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred
to in this ARTICLE VIII. For purposes of any determination under ARTICLE
VIII(c), a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith in a manner he
or she reasonably

 



A-4  believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, if his or her
action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or
another enterprise, or on information supplied to him or her by the officers
of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on
the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on
information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another
enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or
other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another
enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this ARTICLE VIII(h)
shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent. The provisions of this ARTICLE VIII(h) shall not be deemed to be
exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be
deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in ARTICLE
VIII(a) or ARTICLE VIII(b), as the case may be.

 

(i) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this ARTICLE VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained in this ARTICLE VIII to the contrary,
except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be
governed by ARTICLE VIII(d)), the Corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify any person in connection with a proceeding (or part, thereof)
initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors.

(k) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the
Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement
of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those
conferred in this ARTICLE VIII to directors and officers of the Corporation.

 

(l) A right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a
provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the
Corporation shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to such
provision after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of
the civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought,
unless the provision in effect at the time of such act or omission explicitly
authorizes such elimination or impairment after such action or omission has
occurred.
