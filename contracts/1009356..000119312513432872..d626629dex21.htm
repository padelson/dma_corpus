administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. </P>

officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including
attorneys&#146; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and

specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer or other person entitled to indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in ARTICLE VIII(a) or ARTICLE VIII(b), as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to an officer or director, (i)&nbsp;by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit
or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, (ii)&nbsp;by a committee of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding even though less than a quorum, (iii)&nbsp;if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct,
by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv)&nbsp;by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action,
suit or proceeding referred to in ARTICLE VIII(a) or ARTICLE VIII(b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or

in the specific case under ARTICLE VIII(c), and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any present or former director or officer of the Corporation may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for indemnification
to the extent otherwise permissible under ARTICLE VIII(a) and ARTICLE VIII(b). The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because he or she
has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in ARTICLE VIII(a) or ARTICLE VIII(b), as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under ARTICLE VIII(c) nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a
defense to such application or create a presumption that such person seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII(d) shall be given to the
Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, such person seeking indemnification in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such
application. </P>
