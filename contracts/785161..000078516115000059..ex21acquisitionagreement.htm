reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and RHP (the "Blocker Reorganization
Agreement"), such that (i) the Blocker's indirectly-owned ownership equity
interest in each of the Acquired Companies (the "Blocker Assets") shall be
held directly by Newco and represented by limited liability company interests
of Newco distributed to the Blocker through the partial redemption of each
intermediate entity's ownership interest in its directly-owned subsidiary
corresponding to the portion of such equity interests indirectly owned by the
Blocker, and (ii) Reliant Splitter shall be dissolved and liquidated such that
the Blocker becomes the direct owner of such portion of the equity interests

prior to the Closing, to Newco, in exchange for limited liability company

Base Purchase Price between and among the Acquired Companies and RHP for
purposes of determining the price to be offered to all Minority Holders in
connection with the Consent Solicitation. For the avoidance of doubt, such
allocation shall not be controlling for any Tax or GAAP purposes. Section
2.1.4 of the Disclosure Letter also sets forth, for each Majority-Owned
Acquired Company, the EBITDA of such Majority-Owned Acquired Company for the

Equity Interests, the acquisition of the Acquired Assets, the assumption of
the Assumed Capital Leases, and the acquisition and assumption of the Acquired
Contracts pursuant to this Agreement will be an amount in cash (such aggregate
consideration, the "Purchase Price") calculated as follows:

(a) $730,000,000 (the "Base Purchase Price");

exceeds the Working Capital Target; or minus the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Working Capital Amount is less than the Working Capital Target;

(g) minus, an amount equal to the product of (a) an amount equal to (i) 1.35,

of the Disclosure Letter; (ii) 1.25, if the aggregate Stipulated EBITDA
Attributable to all Electing Minority Holders and Selling Minority Holders is

EBITDA Attributable to all Minority Holders of all Majority-Owned Acquired
Companies, as calculated pursuant to Section 2.2.1(g) of the Disclosure
Letter; (iii) 1.20, if the aggregate Stipulated EBITDA Attributable to all

Majority-Owned Acquired Companies, as calculated pursuant to Section 2.2.1(g)
of the Disclosure Letter; or (v) 1.05, if the aggregate Stipulated EBITDA
Attributable to all Electing Minority Holders and Selling Minority Holders is
greater than 90% of the aggregate



\- 21 - Stipulated EBITDA Attributable to all Minority Holders of all Majority-Owned
Acquired Companies, as calculated pursuant to Section 2.2.1(g) of the
Disclosure Letter, multiplied by (b) the sum, for all Majority-Owned Acquired
Companies for which the Consent Condition is not satisfied, of the products
of: (i) the Stipulated EBITDA for such Majority-Owned Acquired Company
multiplied by (ii) the percentage of the outstanding limited partnership
interests of such Majority-Owned Acquired Company owned by the Minority
Holders (other than any Electing Minority Holders) of such Majority-Owned
Acquired Company multiplied by (iii) the EBITDA Multiple.

The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, including in accordance with Section 2.5; provided that the

following the end of the Consent Solicitation Period, or at such other time

provided, however, that, if such third (3rd) Business Day is not the first day
of the month, then the Buyer may elect, in its sole discretion, to delay the
Closing until the first day of the following month (the day on which the
Closing takes place, the "Closing Date"); provided, further, that, if the
Buyer so elects to delay the Closing until the first day of the following
month, during the period beginning on the calendar day following the third

by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the

Subsidiaries shall be liable for any unintentional breach of any
representation or warranty under this Agreement, (b) the Buyer shall not be
able to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 for any reason and
(c) with respect to the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and

thereof and the Accounting Principles and GAAP in a manner and on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the sample balance sheet and sample
calculations attached as Section 2.5.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter (which,
solely for illustration purposes, assumes the Closing occurred on April 30,
2015) and (y) will disregard any and all effects on the assets and liabilities
of the Acquired Companies as a result of the Contemplated Transactions
(including any financing arrangements entered into by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Contemplated Transactions). RHC shall
provide the Buyer and its Representatives reasonable and prompt access to the

Estimated Acquired Company Indebtedness upon the Buyer's request and shall
consult in good faith with the Buyer regarding the implementation of any
reasonable revisions to the calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement and Estimated Acquired Company Indebtedness proposed by the Buyer.
The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Acquired Company Indebtedness,
Estimated Transaction Bonus Payments, Estimated Transaction Expenses,
Estimated Working Capital Amount and Estimated Cash on Hand Amount set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement shall be conclusive for purposes of the
calculation of the Purchase Price payable at the Closing, but shall be subject
to adjustment after the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.5.

2.5.2 Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement. As promptly as practicable,
but in any event within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer will in good faith prepare or cause to be prepared, and will provide to
the Sellers' Representative, an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies as of the Balance Sheet Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet"),
together with a written statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth in
reasonable detail the Buyer's determinations of (i) Acquired Company
Indebtedness, (ii) Transaction Expenses, (iii) Transaction Bonus Payments,
(iv) Working Capital, and (v) Cash on Hand, in the case of clauses (iv) and

accordance with the Accounting Principles and GAAP on a basis and in a manner
consistent with the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the

Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the
Closing with respect to the Acquired Companies or their business or assets, or



\- 25 - any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to the Buyer or any
of its assets or liabilities.

2.5.3 Dispute Notice. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (and
the determinations of the Acquired Company Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses,
Transaction Bonus Payments, Working Capital, and Cash on Hand reflected on the
Closing Statement) will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties unless
the Sellers' Representative provides a written notice (a "Dispute Notice") to
the Buyer no later than forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement setting forth in reasonable detail any
item(s) or amount(s) on the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Statement
that are disputed by the Sellers' Representative (each, a "Disputed Item").
Any item or amount on the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement to
which no dispute is raised in the Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. The Buyer shall make available, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to make available, to the Sellers' Representative and its
Representatives, and shall provide the opportunity to make copies of, the work
papers and other materials used or considered by the Buyer in the preparation
of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and shall provide
reasonable access to personnel and Representatives of the Buyer and the
Acquired Companies who assisted or were consulted in the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement.

2.5.4 Resolution of Disputes. The Buyer and the Sellers' Representative will
attempt to resolve the Disputed Items in good faith during the twenty (20) day
period following delivery of the Dispute Notice and all such discussions will
(unless otherwise agreed by the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative) be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any comparable
applicable state rule. Disputed Items resolved in writing by the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer within the twenty (20) day period will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. If the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative are unable to resolve any Disputed Items in the Dispute Notice
within such twenty (20) day period, either the Buyer or the Sellers'
Representative may provide written notice to the other (the "Dispute
Submission Notice") that such party is submitting such Disputed Items for
resolution to the Independent Referee. The Buyer and Sellers' Representative
shall enter into a customary engagement letter with the Independent Referee.
The Buyer and the Sellers' Representative will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Referee to render its decision as
soon as practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days) after the
submission to the Independent Referee of their respective proposed final
calculations of the Disputed Items (which the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall submit to the Independent Referee not later than ten (10)
days following the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice). Each of the Buyer
and the Sellers' Representative shall, and the Buyer shall cause Newco to, use
reasonable best efforts to comply with all reasonable requests by the
Independent Referee for access to their respective work papers, information,
books, records and similar items, personnel and Representatives. The
Independent Referee will review such final calculations of the Disputed Items
and render a final determination of all Disputed Items in accordance with this
Agreement, provided that the Independent Referee's final determination with
respect to each Disputed Item shall be within the range of the proposed final
calculations of such Disputed



\- 26 - Item as presented in the Buyer's Closing Balance Sheet and/or Closing
Statement pursuant to Section 2.5.2 and the Sellers' Representative's Dispute
Notice pursuant to Section 2.5.3. The Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
each shall be entitled to make a written submission to the Independent Referee
in support of its respective proposed final calculations of the submitted
Disputed Items, provided that such submissions shall be submitted within
twenty (20) days after the submission to the Independent Referee of such
proposed final calculations of the submitted Disputed Items. The Independent
Referee's determination will be (a) in writing and shall include a reasonably
detailed statement of the basis for the Independent Referee's decision, (b)
furnished to each of the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative as soon as
practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days) after the Sellers'
Representative's and the Buyer's respective final calculations of the Disputed
Items have been submitted to the Independent Referee, (c) limited in scope to
the Disputed Items and (d) final, conclusive and binding on the parties, and
judgment on such decision may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Independent Referee shall be borne
by (i) the Sellers' Representative (out of the Sellers' Representative Reserve
and then from the Sellers), on the one hand, and (ii) the Buyer, on the other
hand, based on the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by the parties in
aggregate, and such allocation of fees and expenses shall be calculated by the
Independent Referee and such calculation shall be final and binding on the
parties. By way of illustration, (x) if the Buyer's calculations would have
resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment to the Buyer, and the Sellers'
Representative's calculations would have resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment
to the Sellers and the Independent Referee's final determination results in an
aggregate net payment of $500,000 to the Sellers, then the Buyer and the
Sellers shall pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of such fees and expenses and (y)
if each of such parties' calculations differs from the Independent Referee's
calculation by $1,000,000, the Buyer and the Sellers shall split such fees and
expenses evenly. At any time the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative may
agree to settle any objections raised in the Dispute Notice, including any
Disputed Items submitted to the Independent Referee, which agreement shall be
in writing and final, conclusive and binding upon all of the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter of any such objection so resolved; provided
that the parties shall promptly provide a copy of such agreement to the
Independent Referee and instruct the Independent Referee not to resolve such
Disputed Item, it being agreed that if the Independent Referee nonetheless
resolves such Disputed Item for any reason, the agreement of the parties shall
control.

2.5.5 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. As promptly as possible, but in
any event no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the final
determination, in accordance with Section 2.5.3 and/or Section 2.5.4, of
Acquired Company Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, Transaction Bonus
Payments, Working Capital, and Cash on Hand (respectively, the "Final Acquired
Company Indebtedness", "Final Transaction Expenses", "Final Transaction Bonus
Payments", "Final Working Capital Amount," and "Final Cash on Hand Amount"), a
Purchase Price adjustment shall be made as follows:

(a) if (i) the sum of (A) the Final Working Capital Amount, plus (B) the Final
Cash on Hand Amount, minus (C) the Final Transaction Expenses, minus (D)



\- 27 - the Final Transaction Bonus Payments, minus (E) the Final Acquired Company
Indebtedness is less than (ii) the sum of (A) the Estimated Working Capital
Amount, plus (B) the Estimated Cash on Hand Amount, minus (C) the Estimated
Transaction Expenses, minus (D) the Estimated Transaction Bonus Payments,
minus (E) the Estimated Acquired Company Indebtedness (the amount of such
difference, the "Deficit"), then the Purchase Price will be reduced by an
amount equal to such Deficit, and such Deficit shall be paid to the Buyer
first from the Working Capital Escrow Account until exhausted and then from
the Escrow Account, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; provided that, in the event that any amounts remain in the Working
Capital Escrow Account after payment of the Deficit, Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay at the same time as the
payment of the Deficit such amounts by wire transfer to the Sellers'
Representative for further distribution to the Reliant Sellers in accordance
with the Allocation Schedule; or

(b) if (i) the sum of (A) the Final Working Capital Amount, plus (B) the Final
Cash on Hand Amount, minus (C) the Final Transaction Expenses, minus (D) the
Final Transaction Bonus Payments, minus (E) the Final Acquired Company
Indebtedness is greater than (ii) the sum of (A) the Estimated Working Capital
Amount, plus (B) the Estimated Cash on Hand Amount, minus (C) the Estimated
Transaction Expenses, minus (D) the Estimated Transaction Bonus Payments,
minus (E) the Estimated Acquired Company Indebtedness, then the Purchase Price
will be increased by an amount equal to such excess, and the Buyer will pay
such excess amount to the Sellers' Representative for further distribution to
the Reliant Sellers (in accordance with the Allocation Schedule) within five
(5) Business Days after the determination of such excess amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the
Sellers' Representative, and the Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall cause
the Escrow Agent to pay at the same time all amounts then contained in the
Working Capital Escrow Account by wire transfer to the Sellers' Representative
for further distribution to the Reliant Sellers in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule.

2.6 Withholding Rights. The applicable party shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Purchase Price such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payments under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable party in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

2.7 Payment and Surrender; Payment Fund.

2.7.1 Prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall (with any such cost and expense
shared equally by the Buyer and the Reliant Sellers) designate Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, or such other bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to RHC, to act as payment agent in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions (the "Payment Agent"). At or prior to the Closing, the Buyer will
provide to and shall deposit in trust with, the Payment Agent, an amount in
cash equal to the Closing Cash Payment Amount. Until used for that purpose,
the funds shall



\- 28 - be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by the Buyer, and in accordance
with a Payment Agent Agreement between RHP, the Buyer and the Payment Agent
(the "Payment Agent Agreement") in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America
which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America
or in deposit accounts or certificates of deposit with commercial banks.

2.7.2 As soon as reasonably practicable, RHP shall cause to be mailed or
otherwise made available to RHP, the Blocker Seller, each Electing Minority
Holder and each Selling Minority Holder, a letter of transmittal in the form
to be provided by RHP and reasonably acceptable to the Buyer (a "Letter of
Transmittal"), and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Buyer (including any required Form W-8 or W-9). Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2, from and after the Closing, each certificate
or other evidence, if applicable, that, immediately prior to the Closing,
represented a limited liability company interest of Newco or a Blocker Share
shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive its portion of the
Purchase Price determined pursuant to this Agreement and shall not evidence
any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a security holder of
Newco, the Blocker, or any Acquired Company or any other rights. RHP and the
Payment Agent shall make available to the Buyer a copy of such Letter of
Transmittal at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, and the
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Payment Agent to make
payments on the Closing Date to RHP, the Blocker Seller, and any Electing
Minority Holder who completes and submits a Letter of Transmittal at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

2.7.3 Termination of Payment Fund. At any time which is more than six (6)
months after the Closing, the Buyer shall be entitled to require the Payment
Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been deposited with the Payment
Agent and have not been disbursed in accordance with this Section 2
(including, without limitation, interest and other income received by the
Payment Agent in respect of the funds made available to it), and after the
funds have been delivered to the Buyer, RHP, the Blocker Seller, each Electing
Minority Holder and each Selling Minority Holder entitled to payment in
accordance with this Section 2 shall be entitled to look solely to the Buyer
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar applicable Legal
Requirements) for payment of the Closing Cash Payment Amount upon surrender of
the certificates or other evidence of ownership, if applicable, of a limited
liability company interest or Newco or a Blocker Share, as applicable, without
any interest thereon. Any portion of the Closing Cash Payment Amount remaining
unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Buyer
free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

Affiliates not fully-paid prior to or in connection with the Closing;

Acquired Company in excess of the amounts identified as "Tenant's Costs" on
the Construction Budget; or

9.2.22 agree or commit to do any of the things referred to elsewhere in this
Section 9.2.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, RHP and its Affiliates shall have the right to
settle any pending Action relating to the item set forth on Section 10.2.1(d)
of the Disclosure Letter in any way that RHP deems appropriate in RHP's sole
discretion; provided that RHP shall consult with the Buyer in good faith
during all negotiations relating to such settlement; provided, further, that
RHP shall not settle such Action without the Buyer's consent unless such
settlement does not restrict or have an adverse effect on the Buyer's
operation of the business of the Acquired Companies following the Closing and
includes a full release and waiver of claims against the Buyer in



\- 62 - accordance with the agreement listed on Section 9.2(a) of the Disclosure
Letter. Other than the right to consent or withhold consent with respect to
the foregoing matters (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), nothing contained in this Agreement will give the
Buyer, directly or indirectly, any right to control or direct the operation of

in its reasonable discretion; provided that RHP shall keep the Buyer
reasonably informed of the status of any such filings or disclosures and
related discussions and shall in good faith discuss such disclosures and
discussions with the Buyer; provided, further, that any settlement of Section
9.2 Matters that involves restrictions or limitations on the operation of the
business of the Acquired Companies shall require the prior written consent of
the Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Following the Closing, the Sellers' Representative shall be entitled
to assume the defense of any Section 9.2 Matters, at its sole expense, as if
they were Third Party Claims for which the defense has already been assumed
(subject to Section 10.5, except that any limitations on the ability of
Sellers' Representative to assume the defense contained in Section 10.5 shall
not apply to Section 9.2 Matters).

9.3 Confidentiality.

9.3.1 Confidentiality.

(a) The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect until the Closing, at
which point it shall terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

(b) Notwithstanding the termination of the Confidentiality Agreement at the
Closing, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, the Buyer

the Acquired Companies) furnished to the Buyer or its Affiliates or its or
their respective Representatives in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions.

9.3.2 Announcements. Any public announcements, reports, statements or press
releases by any party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates regarding
the Contemplated



\- 63 - Transactions must be approved in advance (as to form, content, timing and
manner of distribution) by each of the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative;
provided, however, that (a) the Buyer may make disclosures in connection with
its financing of the Contemplated Transactions and (b) any party may make
filings or disclosures to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements
or the listing agreement with or listing rule of any national securities
exchange; provided, further, that the party required to make such filing or
disclosure in accordance with the immediately preceding subsection (b) shall
provide a copy of such filing to the other party, and afford such other party
reasonable opportunity in advance of such filing or disclosure to review and
comment upon the form and substance of such filing or disclosure; provided,
further, that nothing in this Section 9.3.2 shall prohibit any institutional
Seller or Additional Indemnitor from disclosing information relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to its Affiliates or any current
or prospective investor or limited partner of such Seller or Additional
Indemnitor, or their Affiliates, to the extent such disclosure is made in the
ordinary course of such Seller's or Additional Indemnitor's business, as long
as such disclosure is made pursuant and subject to a non-disclosure agreement.

9.3.3 No-Shop.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement and the Closing, each of the Sellers and RHC shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to cease any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person other
than the Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives with respect to, and to
deal exclusively with the Buyer and its designated Affiliates and
Representatives regarding, any Acquisition Proposal and, without the prior
consent of the Buyer, the Sellers and RHC shall not, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to (i) solicit, initiate
or otherwise engage in any negotiations, discussions or other communications
with any other Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) provide or
furnish information or documentation to any other Person with respect to the

other Person in respect of any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement, any Seller or RHC or any Affiliate
thereof receives an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, then, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal,
request for nonpublic information, or inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, RHC shall (i) provide the Buyer
with notice that it has received an Acquisition Proposal or request for
nonpublic information and (ii) respond to the proposing party that it is
unable to consider the Acquisition Proposal or respond to the request for
nonpublic information.

9.4 Preparation for Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each
of the Sellers, RHC, and the Buyer agrees to cooperate with each other and to
use, and cause its



\- 64 - Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts (which shall not require the
payment of any amounts to third parties in connection with obtaining any
consents that are not contemplated by the agreements requiring such consents)
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary or desirable under applicable Legal Requirements, to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable,
including, without limitation, obtaining all consents and preparing and filing
as promptly as practicable with the applicable Governmental Authorities and
third parties all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
consents, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
lien releases and other instruments of termination or discharge with respect
to the Indebtedness set forth on Section 7.7 of the Disclosure Letter,
applications and other documents necessary to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions. In connection with the foregoing, Parent and the Buyer agree to
use reasonable best efforts to have any guarantee or similar obligation
provided by RHP in connection with any lease of any Acquired Company (each, an
"RHP Guarantee") released, including by agreeing to provide a similar
guarantee if so requested by any such landlord (the "Guarantee Release"). In
furtherance (and not in limitation) of the foregoing:

9.4.1 Antitrust Matters. Each of RHC and the Buyer agrees to file or cause to
be filed all appropriate notifications and filings pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other applicable antitrust or competition laws with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions in the most expeditious manner practicable, but in
any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof and to supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested of such party by the relevant Governmental Authorities in connection
with the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust or competition laws. Each
of RHC and the Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to supply
promptly any information required to be submitted to comply with a formal
request for additional information (a "second request") or equivalent request
from the relevant Governmental Authorities and thereafter promptly certify
substantial compliance with such request in order to commence or end a
statutory waiting period. Each of RHC and the Buyer agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust or competition law, as
applicable, and, in furtherance of the foregoing, each of RHC and the Buyer
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate as soon as
possible each and every impediment under the HSR Act and any other applicable
antitrust or competition laws that may be asserted by any United States or
other governmental antitrust authority so as to enable the parties hereto to
expeditiously consummate the Contemplated Transactions; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent, nor any of the
Parent's Subsidiaries shall be required to, and none of the Acquired Companies
shall be permitted to, (i) commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the divestiture, sale, license,
transfer, assignment or other disposition of assets or business of the Parent
or the Acquired Companies (or their respective Subsidiaries), (ii) terminate,
relinquish, modify, transfer, assign, restructure or waive existing
agreements, collaborations, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of the Parent or the Acquired Companies (or their respective
Subsidiaries) or (iii) create or consent to create any contractual rights,
obligations, tolling agreements or other arrangements of the Parent or the
Acquired Companies (or any of their respective Subsidiaries). The Buyer and
RHC shall share equally all filing fees associated with the HSR Act filings
and any other applicable antitrust or competition laws. Each of RHC and the
Buyer agrees to (i) give the other



\- 65 - party prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, litigation,
hearing, examination or Action with respect to the Contemplated Transactions,
(ii) keep the other party reasonably informed as to the status of any such
request, litigation, hearing, examination or Action, (iii) promptly inform the
other party of any communication to or from any Governmental Authority to the
extent regarding the Contemplated Transactions, or regarding any such request,
litigation, hearing, examination or Action, and provide a copy of all written
communications, and (iv) pull and re-file any notice under the HSR Act only if
the other party agrees. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, in advance
and to the extent practicable, each of RHC or the Buyer, as the case may be,
will consult the other on all the information relating to RHC or the Buyer, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
Governmental Authority in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and
shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by RHC or the Buyer, as the
case may be; provided, however, that, if review of any information would be
material in connection with any second request (or similar process), such
information shall be provided solely to those individuals acting as outside
antitrust counsel for the other party, provided that such counsel shall not
disclose such information to such other party and shall enter into a joint
defense agreement with the providing party. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any applicable Legal
Requirement, in connection with any such request, litigation, hearing,
examination or Action with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each party will permit authorized representatives of the other
party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request,
litigation, hearing, examination or Action and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with such request,
litigation, hearing, examination or Action. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Buyer, after prior consultation with
RHC, shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the
strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition clearances and
shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental
Authority in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition
clearances; provided that RHC shall be permitted to participate in such
meetings and communications unless excluded from doing so by a Governmental
Authority or to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of the Buyer's
competitively sensitive information, in which case individuals acting as RHC's
outside antitrust counsel shall be permitted to participate, provided that
such counsel shall not disclose Buyer's competitively sensitive information to
RHC.

9.4.2 Buyer Transactions. Prior to the Closing or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, the Buyer will not enter into any transaction, or any
contractual arrangement or other agreement, whether oral or written, to effect
any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay: (a) obtaining the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (b) avoiding the entry
of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or effecting the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions or (c) obtaining all authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions.



\- 66 - 9.4.3 Third Party Consents. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 9.4.1,
each of the Buyer, the Sellers, and RHC shall use reasonable best efforts, and
shall reasonably cooperate with one another, in (a) determining whether any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from third
parties to any Leases or Material Contracts in connection with the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and (b) taking all actions,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain
in a timely manner, any actions, consents, approvals or waivers necessary to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, including to transfer to the Buyer
(or its designee) the Acquired Contracts and Acquired Assets and those items
set forth in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Letter and Section 5.4 of the
Disclosure Letter; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall obligate or
be construed to obligate the Buyer, the Sellers or the Acquired Companies to
make or cause to be made any material payment or material concession to any
third party in order to obtain any such action, consent, approval or waiver
under any Lease or Material Contract.

9.5 Business Records. The Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers and/or the
Sellers' Representative (on behalf of one or more Sellers) may from time to
time from and after the Closing require access to the Records, and the Buyer
agrees that upon reasonable prior notice, it will, and will ensure that the
Acquired Companies will, during normal business hours, provide the Sellers and
their respective Representatives with either access to or copies of the
Records. If the Buyer or any Acquired Company shall desire to dispose of any
such Records prior to the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall, prior to any such disposition, notify the Sellers' Representative
and provide to the Sellers' Representative (or, if applicable, its designee)
and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity, at the Sellers'
Representative's expense, to make copies of or remove such Records.

9.6 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

9.6.1 the Buyer, RHP and the Acquired Companies agree that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability for or
in connection with acts or omissions occurring at any time prior to or on the
Closing Date, that now exist in favor of any Person who prior to or on the
Closing Date is or was a current or former director, manager, member, general
partner, officer or employee of RHP or an Acquired Company, or who at the
request of RHP or an Acquired Company served prior to or on the Closing Date
as a director, officer, member, manager, employee, trustee or fiduciary of any
other entity of any type (each a "DandO Indemnified Person") provided in the
Organizational Documents of RHP or an Acquired Company, or in any agreement
between a DandO Indemnified Person and RHP or an Acquired Company set forth on
Section 9.6.1 of the Disclosure Letter (an "Indemnity Agreement") will survive
the Closing and will continue in full force and effect for the six (6) year
period following the Closing Date. In furtherance (and not in limitation of)
the foregoing, for the six (6) year period following the Closing Date, the
Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies to, and the Acquired Companies will
(a) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Person the provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liability in the Organizational Documents of RHP and each of the Acquired
Companies and (b) continue in existence each Indemnity Agreement without
termination, revocation, amendment



\- 67 - or other modification that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
DandO Indemnified Person.

9.6.2 On or before the Closing Date, RHP will obtain (and RHP and the Buyer
shall split evenly the costs of obtaining) for the Acquired Companies, and,
for a six (6) year period following the Closing Date, the Buyer will cause to
be maintained in effect, with no lapse in coverage, one or more "tail" or
"runoff" directors' and officers' liability and employment practices liability
insurance policies covering actual or claimed acts or omissions of any DandO
Indemnified Person occurring on or before the Closing Date, in each case on
terms with respect to coverage, retentions, amounts and other material terms
no less favorable in the aggregate to such DandO Indemnified Persons as those of
such policies in effect as of the date hereof.

9.6.3 If any Acquired Company (or any of its successors or assigns) (a)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (b)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other
Person (including by dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or similar action), then, and in each such case, the Buyer will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause proper provision to be made so that such
other Person fully assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 9.6.

9.6.4 In any Action involving a DandO Indemnified Person and one or more other
DandO Indemnified Persons, a DandO Indemnified Person shall have the right and
obligation to control such DandO Indemnified Person's defense of the Action, or
at the sole election of the DandO Indemnified Person, to tender control of the
defense to the Buyer; provided, however, that if all DandO Indemnified Persons
do not tender control of the defense to the Buyer, such DandO Indemnified
Persons shall reasonably cooperate with each other to retain a single law firm
(and, if reasonable under the circumstances, one local law firm) to represent
such DandO Indemnified Persons; provided, further, however, that, if the DandO
Indemnified Persons are unable to agree on a single law firm within thirty
(30) days of the filing of such Action, the Buyer (or its designee) shall have
the right to select counsel reasonably acceptable to the DandO Indemnified
Persons (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed) for the defense of such Action; provided, further, however, that a
DandO Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain separate counsel (but not
more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel) at the Buyer's
expense if (a) a DandO Indemnified Person or such law firm reasonably concludes
the use of such law firm to represent such DandO Indemnified Person and any
other DandO Indemnified Persons would present such counsel with an actual or
potential conflict of interest or other significant divergence of interest,
(b) a DandO Indemnified Person or such law firm reasonably concludes that there
may be one or more legal defenses available to such DandO Indemnified Person
that are different from or in addition to those available to the other DandO
Indemnified Persons, or (c) any such representation by such counsel would be
precluded under the applicable standards of professional conduct then
prevailing, it being understood and agreed by the parties that the fewest
number of counsels necessary to avoid such conflicts of interest shall be
used. In the event that defense of a matter is tendered to the Buyer, all DandO
Indemnified Persons tendering such matter will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter, and the Buyer shall not,



\- 68 - without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified Persons, settle any
Action in any manner that would: (x) impose any fine or other obligation on
such DandO Indemnified Persons, including an admission of culpability on behalf
of such DandO Indemnified Persons; or (y) not include a full release of such DandO
Indemnified Persons from all liability in respect of such Action, which
release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the DandO
Indemnified Persons. In the event that any DandO Indemnified Person controls his
or her own defense, the Buyer and the applicable Acquired Company shall not be
liable for any settlement effected by such DandO Indemnified Person without the
Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall
not have any obligation hereunder to such DandO Indemnified Person to the extent
that a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such DandO
Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Legal Requirements.

9.6.5 The provisions of this Section 9.6 shall survive the Closing. This
Section 9.6 shall be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her respective heirs, executors,
administrators, estates, successors and assigns, and each such Person shall be
an express intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement for such
purposes. The Buyer shall pay, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to pay,
as and when incurred by any Person referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence, all fees, costs, charges and expenses incurred by such Person in
enforcing such Person's rights under this Section 9.6. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations under this Section
9.6 shall not be terminated, revoked, modified or amended in any way so as to
adversely affect any Person referred to in the second sentence of this Section
9.6.5 without the written consent of such Person. With respect to any right to
indemnification or advancement for actual or claimed acts or omissions
occurring prior to or on the Closing Date, each Acquired Company, as and if
applicable, shall be the indemnitor of first resort, responsible for all such
indemnification and advancement that any DandO Indemnified Person may otherwise
have rights to from any direct or indirect equity holder of any of the
Acquired Companies (or any Affiliate of such equity holder) and without right
to seek subrogation, indemnity or contribution. Each of the Acquired Companies
and the Buyer further agrees that no advance or prepayment by any party other
than the Acquired Companies as the primary indemnitor on behalf of any DandO
Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which such DandO Indemnified
Person has sought indemnification from any of the Acquired Companies shall
affect the foregoing and that any such secondary indemnitor shall have a right
of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or
payment to all the rights of recovery of the DandO Indemnified Person against
the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Companies hereby irrevocably release
any such secondary indemnitor from, and irrevocably waive and relinquish any
right to assert against any such secondary indemnitor, any and all claims for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. Each of the Acquired Companies, the Buyer, and the DandO Indemnified
Persons agrees that the secondary indemnitors are express third party
beneficiaries of this Section 9.6.5.





\- 69 - 9.7 Tax Matters.

9.7.1 Transfer Taxes. Except for Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
the Blocker Reorganization and which would not have otherwise been incurred in
connection with the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
shall be borne solely by the Sellers, the Buyer and the Sellers shall share
equally all Transfer Taxes. The applicable parties shall fully cooperate in
filing such forms and documents as may be necessary to permit any such
Transfer Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with any available pre sale filing procedure, and to obtain any
exemption or refund of any such Transfer Tax.

9.7.2 Pre-Closing Tax Period Taxes and Tax Returns.

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties agree to treat, and
shall cause the Blocker and each Acquired Company to treat, the Closing Date
as the last day of a taxable period of the Blocker and each Acquired Company
for United States federal income Tax purposes and shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, elect with the relevant
Governmental Authority to treat, for all other income Tax purposes, the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of the Blocker and each
Acquired Company.

(b) Subject to Section 9.7.1, the Sellers' Representative shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, in a manner consistent with past practice unless
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, all Tax Returns for the
Acquired Companies and Blocker that relate to (or include) any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and that are due after the Closing Date. The Sellers' Representative
shall provide the Buyer with a copy of any such Tax Return (together with
supporting workpapers) for the Buyer's review no later than, in the case of
Tax Returns for Income Taxes ("Income Tax Returns"), one hundred and twenty
(120) days following the Closing Date and, in the case of other Tax Returns,
as soon as is commercially practicable, accompanied by a statement calculating
in reasonable detail the Sellers' Representative's payment obligation, if any,
pursuant to Section 9.7.2(c). If for any reason the Buyer does not agree with
any position taken on any such Tax Return, the Buyer shall notify the Sellers'
Representative of its disagreement within thirty (30) Business Days of (in the
case of Income Tax Returns), and in the case of other Tax Returns promptly,
receiving a copy of the Tax Return (together with supporting workpapers), and
the disputed item shall be resolved in a manner mutually agreeable to the
parties. In the case of Income Tax Returns, if not so resolved, then by an
internationally recognized accounting firm of comparable stature reasonably
acceptable to both the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative that is
independent of the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (the "Accounting
Firm") within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing
such Tax Return. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return
shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution and shall be binding upon the
parties without further adjustment. The costs, fees, and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the parties in a manner similar to that
provided in Section 2.5.4. In the event that a resolution cannot be reached



\- 70 - prior to the last date for timely filing a Tax Return (giving effect to any
valid extensions), the Buyer shall file such Tax Return as prepared by the
Sellers' Representative prior to such resolution, provided, however, that the
Buyer shall be required to amend such Tax Return to reflect the position of
the Accounting Firm, if different. The Buyer or the applicable Acquired
Company or Blocker shall file, or cause to be filed, all such Tax Returns.

(c) Subject to Section 9.7.1, the Sellers' Representative shall pay or cause
to be paid (in each case, solely from the Escrow Funds) the Taxes shown as due
on any Tax Return described in Section 9.7.2(b) to the extent such Taxes
relate to (or include) any Pre-Closing Tax Period (determined in accordance
with Section 9.7.4). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including this Section 9.7.2 or Section 10), the Sellers and the
Sellers' Representative shall have no liability under this Agreement
(including via the Escrow Agreement) with respect to (and Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid) (x) any Taxes that were taken into account as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price, (y) Taxes incurred by an Acquired Company, the Blocker,
a Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates as a result of actions outside
the ordinary course taken after the Closing (including the incurrence of
Indebtedness by an Acquired Company or Blocker or Buyer or its Affiliates in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions) or (z) Taxes for a Post-Closing
Tax Period. For clarification, any Taxes due with respect to the Blocker shall
be paid solely through Escrow Funds attributable to the Blocker Seller, and
Taxes due with respect to the Acquired Companies shall be paid through Escrow
Funds attributable to all Sellers.

(d) The parties agree that all losses, deductions, credits and any other Tax
benefits available on account of the payment or incurrence of the Transaction
Expenses, the Transaction Bonus Payments, the payment of the Acquired Company
Indebtedness, and the other transactions or payments contemplated by this
Agreement shall be reported in Pre-Closing Tax Periods (and otherwise treated
as attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods) to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements. Success-based fees shall be reported in
accordance with Rev. Proc. 2011-29.

(e) Newco and the Acquired Companies shall each make an election under Section
754 of the Code (and corresponding provisions of state and local law)
effective for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date, whether or not
such an election has been made in any prior year. If, as a result of the
Blocker Reorganization, an Acquired Company becomes a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, such Acquired Company shall file a tax return for
any short taxable year resulting from any subsequent transaction contemplated
by this Agreement and shall make an election under Section 754 of the Code
(and corresponding provisions of state and local law) effective for such short
taxable year.

9.7.3 Amended Returns; Tax Elections. The Buyer shall not, and shall cause the
Blocker and the Acquired Companies not to, unless otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements, (a) make any amendment of any Tax Returns of
the Blocker or the Acquired



\- 71 - Companies to the extent such Tax Return relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or to the extent such amendment would otherwise materially adversely affect
the Sellers without the Sellers' Representative's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, condition, or delayed) or (b) make
any election that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or that
would otherwise materially adversely affect any Seller without such Seller's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
condition, or delayed).

9.7.4 Straddle Periods. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes of the Blocker or the Acquired Companies not based upon or measured by
income, activities, events, the level of any item, gain, receipts, proceeds,
profits or similar items for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. The amount of any other Taxes for a Straddle Period that
relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for
such purpose the taxable period of any partnership will be deemed to end as of
the close of business on the Closing Date); provided, however, that any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for depreciation
or real estate Taxes) shall be apportioned on a daily basis.

9.7.5 Tax Proceedings. Subject to Section 9.7.6, in the event of any audit,
assessment, examination, claim or other controversy or proceeding relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns of Blocker or any Acquired Company (a "Tax Proceeding")
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Buyer shall inform the
Sellers' Representative of such Tax Proceeding as soon as possible but in any
event within thirty (30) Business Days after the receipt by the Buyer of
notice thereof. The Sellers' Representative shall control such Tax Proceedings
at their own expense; provided that the Buyer shall control a Tax Proceeding
(at its own expense) if and for so long as each of the following conditions is
satisfied: (i) the Escrow Termination Date has passed; (ii) the Buyer is not
seeking indemnification for any Tax claim that has survived the Escrow
Termination Date; and (iii) the Buyer has paid all amounts due under Section
9.7.7 of this Agreement. If the Sellers' Representative controls the Tax
Proceedings, then it shall keep the Buyer informed of such Tax Proceedings and
shall not settle or otherwise resolve such Tax Proceeding without the consent
of the Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

9.7.6 Refunds and Credits. Any after-tax refunds (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, overpayments of estimated Taxes) of or credits against Taxes
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) of, or with
respect to, the Blocker or any Acquired Company that are attributable or
allocable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period will be for the benefit of the
Sellers, except to the extent any such refunds or credits are attributable to
a carry-back of net operating losses or other Tax attributes from a Post-
Closing Tax Period. The Sellers' Representative shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all such claims for refunds or credits (a "Refund Claim") and, in
preparing each such Refund Claim, shall carry back, to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable Tax law, all Transaction Tax Deductions to the Pre-
Closing Tax



\- 72 - Periods of the Blocker or the Acquired Companies, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.7.6, but subject to
Section 10.4, the Buyer may retain any refunds received after the Escrow
Termination Date to the extent of, and in satisfaction of, any Loss related to
a claim for unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Companies or the Blocker, as
applicable, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that would be indemnified under
Section 10.2.1 without regard to the limitations on recovery in Section 10.2.
The Sellers' Representative shall provide the Buyer with a copy of all such
Refund Claims (together with supporting workpapers) for the Buyer's review no
later than 210 days following the Closing Date. The Refund Claims will reflect
the Buyer's reasonable comments. The Buyer will pay the amount of any such
refunds (whether received as a refund or as a credit against or an offset of
Taxes otherwise payable), net of all Taxes and out-of-pocket costs, related to
the receipt thereof, as directed by the Sellers' Representative within ten
(10) days of receipt. The Buyer will, if the Sellers' Representative so
requests, cause the relevant entity to file each Refund Claim prepared by the
Sellers' Representative. For clarification, any refunds or credits of, or with
respect to, the Blocker shall be for the benefit of the Blocker Seller only,
and any refunds or credits of, or with respect to, the Acquired Companies
shall be for the benefit of all Sellers.

9.7.7 Transaction Tax Benefits. Without duplication, after the application of
Section 9.7.6, and as directed by the Sellers' Representative, the Buyer will
promptly forward to the Sellers' Representative for distribution to the
Sellers the amount of any Transaction Tax Benefit actually realized by the
Blocker or any successor to the Blocker. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 9.7.7, but subject to Section 10.4, the Buyer may
retain any Transaction Tax Benefit received after the Escrow Termination Date
to the extent of, and in satisfaction of, any Loss related to a claim for
unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Companies or the Blocker, as applicable, for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period that would be indemnified under Section 10.2.1 without
regard to the limitations on recovery in Section 10.2. For purposes of
determining the year in which a Transaction Tax Benefit is actually realized
by the Buyer, the parties shall treat all other losses, deductions, and
credits of the Buyer for the applicable Post-Closing Tax Period as having been
used prior to any Transaction Tax Deductions. For clarification, any
Transaction Tax Benefits of, or with respect to, the Blocker shall be for the
benefit of the Blocker Seller only, and any Transaction Tax Benefits of, or
with respect to, the Acquired Companies shall be for the benefit of all
Sellers.

9.7.8 Cooperation and Tax Record Retention. The Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested
by either party in connection with the preparation, execution and filing of
Tax Returns and in connection with any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation shall
include access to records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, making employees and outside consultants
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative each agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Each party shall fully cooperate
with the other in connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns pursuant
to this Section 9.7.8, in



\- 73 - connection with any claim for a refund or credit (or Tax Proceeding) governed
by Section 9.7.6, and in connection with any Tax Proceeding jointly controlled
pursuant to Section 9.7.5. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer shall retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Blocker or the Acquired Companies
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof) applicable to such
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority.

9.7.9 FIRPTA. The Blocker shall deliver to the Buyer a properly executed
statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), and Newco shall deliver to the Buyer a
properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-11T(d)(2).

9.8 Employee Matters. At or prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver, in
writing, an offer of employment to those employees of RHP listed in Tier I on
Section 9.8 of the Disclosure Letter to commence such employment immediately
upon the Closing Date, which offers shall be subject to such employees'
successful completion of Buyer's employment processes, including a criminal
background investigation and drug screening. In addition, at or prior to the
Closing, the Buyer will interview those employees of RHP listed in Tier II on
Section 9.8 of the Disclosure Letter to consider whether to make an offer of
employment or an alternative consulting or other services arrangement for such
employees with such employment, consulting or other services to commence
immediately upon the Closing Date, which offers shall be made in Buyer's sole
discretion and subject to such employees' successful completion of Buyer's
employment processes, including a criminal background investigation and drug
screening. Such individuals who are offered employment and accept such offer
and commence employment on the Closing Date are referred to herein as the
"Transferred Employees." As of the Closing, RHP shall terminate the employment
of those Transferred Employees who accept an offer of employment from the
Buyer and the Buyer shall employ the Transferred Employees and provide all
Transferred Employees with positions, salaries, wages and benefits at levels
comparable, in the aggregate, to those currently received by the Transferred
Employees. The Buyer shall honor each Transferred Employee's rights in respect
of accrued paid time off and extended illness bank and give each Transferred
Employee credit therefor. The Buyer shall recognize the tenure of each
Transferred Employee while in the employ of RHP or its Affiliates for purposes
of determining benefits available to such Transferred Employees under the
Buyer's employee benefit plans (which shall include a waiver of preexisting
condition exclusions for Transferred Employees and their dependents and
recognition of or credit for all deductibles paid by such Transferred Employee
during the current period while in the employ of RHP or its Affiliates).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer shall provide credit for
eligibility, benefit accrual and vesting purposes for all such Transferred
Employees' periods of service with RHP or its Affiliates for purposes any
employee benefit plan or program, excluding the Buyer's 401(k) Plan, but
including paid time off, holiday and severance benefits. The service credited
under any welfare and other benefit plans of the Buyer will include all
service credited under the welfare and other benefit plans of RHP and its
Affiliates, respectively. For individuals who are offered consulting or other
services arrangements in lieu of employment, the terms of such arrangements
will be as mutually agreed between the Buyer and each such individual. The
Buyer shall have no



\- 74 - obligation, and the Sellers shall take no action that would have the effect of
requiring the Buyer, to continue any specific plans. No provision of this
Agreement shall be treated as an amendment to any particular employee benefit
plan of the Buyer, Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer shall be
responsible for any severance costs required to be paid to any employees of
RHP listed on Tier I (solely to the extent required by RHP's severance policy)
and Tier II of Section 9.8 of the Disclosure Letter in accordance with RHP's
severance policy in effect as of the date hereof and attached to Section 9.8
of the Disclosure Letter. Prior to the Closing Date, RHP shall take all
actions that may be necessary or appropriate to cause RHP's 401(k) Plan to
terminate as of immediately prior to the Closing. All resolutions, notices or
other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with such
termination shall be subject to the Buyer's prior review and comment.

9.9 Notification. The Sellers and RHC shall, prior to the Closing Date, by
written notice to the Buyer, promptly supplement the Disclosure Letter (such
supplements, collectively, the "Schedule Notices") with respect to any event
that arises after the date of this Agreement that would, in the absence of
such Schedule Notice, cause a failure of any condition set forth in Section 7
on the Closing Date. Schedule Notices shall have no effect to cure any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or to satisfy any of the closing
conditions set forth in Section 7 and shall not limit the indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 10.

9.10 Further Assurances. Each of RHC, the Sellers' Representative, on behalf
of the Sellers, and the Buyer, upon the request of any of the others from time
to time after the Closing, and at the expense of the requesting party but
without further consideration, shall sign such documents and take such actions
as may be necessary or otherwise reasonably requested to effect the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

9.11 Financing. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and RHC shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer in
connection with the arrangement of its financing of the Contemplated
Transactions, including, without limitation: (i) upon reasonable prior notice,
making senior management of RHC and its Subsidiaries available to (1)
participate in, and reasonably assist the Buyer in the Buyer's preparation of
materials for, and meetings with the administrative agent of the Buyer's
existing credit facility and any of the Buyer's other financing sources at
reasonable times in a reasonable number of meetings, (2) reasonably assist the
Buyer in the Buyer's preparation of materials for meetings with rating
agencies, and (3) reasonably assist the Buyer's preparation of offering

accountant of RHC and its Subsidiaries be available to the Buyer and such

the Buyer with such financial and other information as the Buyer or such
financing sources may reasonably request, including without limitation, any
updated or restated financial statements of the Acquired Companies and
financial statements for periods following the date of this Agreement; (iv)
providing customary assistance to the Buyer in the Buyer's preparation or
filing of any security or collateral documents necessary in connection with
the



\- 75 - Buyer's financing of the Contemplated Transactions; and (v) requesting
releases of Liens and pay-off letters in accordance with the terms hereof;
provided, however, that with respect to clauses (i) through (v) above, (A)
prior to the Closing, the Sellers and RHC and its Subsidiaries will not be
required to authorize or execute or become bound by any agreement that is
effective prior to the Closing, (B) nothing in this Section 9.11 shall require
cooperation to the extent that it would (x) cause any condition to Closing set
forth in Section 7 to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement or (y) reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate the any of
RHC's or its Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents or any Legal Requirement,
or result in the material contravention of, or result in a material violation
or breach of, or default under, any Material Contract, or result in loss of
attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protection, and (C) the
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless RHC and its Subsidiaries, and
their respective pre-Closing directors and officers from and against any
liability or obligation to providers of the financing for the Contemplated
Transactions in connection with any such financing and any information
provided in connection therewith. The Buyer shall reimburse RHC, the Sellers
and the Acquired Companies for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
RHC, the Sellers and the Acquired Companies in connection with this Section
9.11, and if not reimbursed as of the Closing, such reimbursement amounts
shall be deemed Current Assets for purposes of calculating Working Capital.

9.12 Contributions; Blocker Reorganization; Acquired Contracts and Other
Contracts.

9.12.1 Pursuant to the Contribution Agreements and such other consents,
actions, agreements, notices and other instruments of transfer and assignment
between or among RHC, RHP, Newco, and any of their Affiliates as may be
necessary or advisable to effect the First Contribution and the Second
Contribution and as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing, RHC and RHP, shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, take such steps as are required to effect the

assignment between or among the Blocker Seller, the Blocker, and any of their
Affiliates as may be necessary or advisable to effect the Blocker
Reorganization and as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Blocker Seller and the Blocker
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, take such steps as are
required to effect the Blocker Reorganization, including, without limitation,
such steps as are required to (i) transfer and deliver to Newco all of the
Blocker Assets, free and clear of all Liens, in exchange for the issuance of

\- 76 - liquidate the Reliant Splitter such that the Blocker does not retain, and is
not responsible for, any liabilities of the Reliant Splitter.

9.12.3 Pursuant to such consents, actions, agreements, assignments,
assumptions and other instruments of transfer and assignment as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing, the Buyer, RHC and its Subsidiaries, and the Sellers shall
cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly all necessary consents to
assign, transfer and convey all Assumed Capital Leases and Acquired Contracts
to the Buyer (or its designee). Following the Closing, each such party shall
continue to use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cooperate with each
other, to obtain promptly all necessary consents to assign, transfer and
convey any Acquired Contracts that were not so assigned, transferred or
conveyed as of the Closing. If and when any necessary consent for the
assignment, transfer or conveyance of any Acquired Contract is obtained (or if
the Buyer notifies the Sellers that the Buyer has determined that such consent
is no longer necessary), RHC and its Subsidiaries and the Sellers shall, and
shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, promptly assign, transfer and
convey, such Acquired Contract to the Buyer (or its designee). To the extent
that an Acquired Contract cannot be assigned, transferred or conveyed to the
Buyer (or its designee), then, insofar as reasonably possible and to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements: (i) RHP shall thereafter
hold such Acquired Contract for the use and benefit of the Buyer (or its
designee); (ii) the Buyer (or its designee) shall, or shall cause one of the
Acquired Companies to, pay, perform and discharge such liability, on a timely
basis and in accordance with the terms thereof, on behalf of RHP; and (iii)
RHP shall treat such Acquired Contract in the ordinary course of business in
accordance with past practice and take such other actions as may be reasonably
requested by the Buyer (or its designee) in order to place the Buyer in a
substantially similar position as if such Acquired Contract had been assigned,
transferred or conveyed to the Buyer in connection with the Closing and so
that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Acquired Contract and all
costs and expenses related thereto, shall inure from and after the Closing to
the Buyer or an Acquired Contract.

9.12.4 Pursuant to such consents, actions, agreements, assignments,
assumptions and other instruments of transfer and assignment as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing, the Buyer, RHC and its Subsidiaries, and the Sellers shall
cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly all consents necessary for the
Acquired Companies to maintain the Contracts used by them to conduct the
Business. Following the Closing, each such party shall continue to use its
reasonable best efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain
promptly all consents necessary for the Acquired Companies to maintain such
Contracts used by them to conduct the Business that were not obtained as of
the Closing. To the extent that any such consent is not obtained, then,
insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements: (i) RHP shall thereafter hold such Contract for the use and
benefit of the Buyer or the Acquired Companies; (ii) the Buyer (or its
designee) shall, or shall cause one of the Acquired Companies to, pay, perform
and discharge such liability, on a timely basis and in accordance with the
terms thereof, on behalf of RHP; and (iii) RHP shall treat such Contract in
the ordinary course of business in accordance with past practice and take such
other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer (or its designee) in
order to place the Buyer in a



\- 77 - substantially similar position as if consent with respect to such Contract had
been obtained in connection with the Closing and so that all the benefits and
burdens relating to such Contract and all costs and expenses related thereto,
shall inure from and after the Closing to the Buyer or an Acquired Company.

9.13 Consent Solicitation; Purchase of Equity Interests Owned by Minority
Holders. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, but not
later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, RHC
shall prepare a disclosure statement relating to the Contemplated Transactions
and to the Consent Solicitation for distribution to the Minority Holders (the
"Consent Package"). RHC shall provide Buyer and its Representatives with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Consent Package, shall
consider any such comments in good faith, shall consult with Buyer and its
Representatives about the contents of the Consent Package and shall not
include any information about Parent or Buyer unless such information is
reasonably acceptable to Buyer. RHC shall use reasonable best efforts, which
shall not be deemed to require any increase in price to be offered to any
Minority Holder, to cause the Consent Condition to be satisfied and, in
furtherance of the foregoing, shall cause the applicable Acquired Company
and/or Reliant Controlled Entity to distribute the Consent Package to all
applicable Minority Holders. Following the date of distribution of the Consent
Package to all Minority Holders, the Minority Holders shall have twenty (20)
Business Days (the "Consent Solicitation Period") in which to provide their
consent. RHC agrees that the Consent Package shall, among other things,
include documentation requiring each Minority Holder that wishes to sell its
equity interests in the Contemplated Transactions and so become an Electing
Minority Holder to execute a joinder to this Agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D and become a party to this Agreement and make the
representations and warranties with respect to itself contained in Section 5
and agree to appoint the Sellers' Representative as such Minority Holder's
representative for all purposes and with all rights and powers set forth in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, RHP and RHC
may, in their sole discretion, increase the price to be paid to any Minority
Holder in the event that such Minority Holder will become an Electing Minority
Holder, with such increases to be paid out of the Purchase Price otherwise
payable to the Reliant Sellers. During the Consent Solicitation Period, RHC
agrees to cause its Representatives to be reasonably available to any Minority
Holders to discuss the Consent Solicitation and the Contemplated Transactions
as such Minority Holders may reasonably request, and Parent and Buyer agree,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to cooperate in good faith in
such discussions with or responses to any Minority Holders as RHC may
reasonably request. For the avoidance of doubt, RHC shall bear all costs and
expenses of the preparation of the Consent Package and the Consent
Solicitation, and RHC and the Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Parent, the Buyer, and their respective Affiliates from and against
any liability or obligation arising out of or relating to the Consent Package
and the Consent Solicitation.

9.14 Intercompany Agreements. Except as set forth on Section 9.14 of the
Disclosure Letter, RHC and the Sellers shall terminate, or cause to be
terminated, with no further liability or obligation of any Acquired Company,
on or prior to the Closing, all Intercompany Agreements and at the Closing
shall provide reasonably satisfactory written evidence thereof to the Buyer.
RHC and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates hereby waive all rights to require any
Acquired Company



\- 78 - to purchase or redeem any equity interest or other ownership interest that RHC
or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may have, directly or indirectly, in any
such Acquired Company pursuant to any Contract listed on Section 3.15 of the
Disclosure Letter or otherwise.

Indemnified Party for indemnification pursuant to Sections 10.2.1(a) or 10.3
prior to the Escrow Termination Date, if then unresolved, will survive the
Escrow Termination Date until such claim is resolved. Nothing contained in

extent resulting from or arising out of or in connection with any breach by
such Electing Minority Holder of any of the representations and warranties set
forth in its respective joinder to this Agreement, and no Reliant Seller shall
be responsible for any such indemnification.

(c) From and after the Closing, subject to the provisions of this Section 10
and giving effect to Section 2.3 if applicable, the Blocker Seller shall
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses
imposed on or suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for (i)
any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4 with
respect to the Blocker, (ii) any unpaid Taxes of the Blocker for any Pre-

Escrow Funds, it being understood and agreed that the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall have recourse for indemnification under this Section 10 solely
and exclusively to, and to the extent of, the Escrow Funds in accordance with
this Section 10 for claims for indemnification pursuant to Section
10.2.1(a)(i) (other than with respect to a breach of the representations and

Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties set forth in

Claims") and (b) the aggregate Losses for which indemnification would
otherwise be available under Section 10.2.1(a)(i) (excluding Minor Claims)
exceed $5,500,000 (the "Deductible"), at which point indemnification shall be
available to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under Section 10.2.1(a)(i) only for
those Losses in excess of the Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Losses arising out of Section 9.2 Matters shall be counted against the
Deductible applicable to all other claims to which this Section 10.2.3
applies. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that the
limitations in this Section 10.2.3 shall not apply with respect to claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2.1(a)(ii), Section 10.2.1(a)(iii),
Section 10.2.1(b), Section 10.2.1(c), or Section 10.2.1(d).

The applicable Buyer Indemnified Party will provide the Sellers'
Representative with a prompt, detailed written notice for any claim made in
respect of the indemnification provided in this Section 10.2 (including the
basis of such claim, the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been
breached and the amount of Losses incurred or suffered, or expected to be
incurred or suffered, with respect thereto), whether or not arising out of a
Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
a Buyer Indemnified Party may, for



\- 81 - indemnification of any claim pursuant to Section 10.2.1(b), Section 10.2.1(c),
and Section 10.2.1(d), have recourse to either or both of the Escrow Amount
and any applicable indemnitor or indemnitors. Nautic Management VI, L.P.
shall, at the Closing, deliver to the Buyer a commitment in the form of
Exhibit I hereto.

10.3 Indemnity by the Buyer. From and after the Closing, subject to the
provisions of this Section 10, the Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers'
Representative, each Seller and each of their respective Affiliates and each
of the respective successors and assigns of the foregoing (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") and hold them harmless from and against any and
all Losses imposed on or suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnified
Parties (a) to the extent resulting from, arising out of or in connection with
any breach of the Buyer Fundamental Representations or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement of the Buyer in this Agreement or any covenant or
agreement to be performed by the Blocker or the Acquired Companies following
the Closing, (b) with respect to Transfer Taxes or any Taxes described in
clause (x), (y), or (z) of Section 9.7.2(b) or (c) arising out of or in
connection with any RHP Guarantee for which a Guarantee Release has not been
obtained or consummated as of the Closing, but solely with respect to Losses
incurred following the Closing.

The applicable Seller Indemnified Party or the Sellers' Representative will
provide the Buyer with a prompt, detailed written notice for any claim made in
respect of the indemnification provided in this Section 10.3 (including the
basis of such claim, the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been
breached and the amount of Losses incurred or suffered, or expected to be
incurred or suffered, with respect thereto), whether or not arising out of a
Third Party Claim.

10.4 Calculation of Losses; Materiality.

10.4.1 For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under this Section 10, the amount of such Losses will be
determined net of (a) any amounts taken into account as liabilities in the
calculation of the Final Working Capital Amount or any other adjustments to
the Purchase Price set forth in Section 2.5, (b) all liabilities reflected in
the Financial Statements, and (c) the sum of any amounts actually recovered
under insurance policies or other amounts recovered from third parties with
respect to such Losses (net of any actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
collecting such amounts) ("Insurance Proceeds") and (d) any Tax benefit
actually received by the Indemnified Party (or any consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which the Indemnified Party is also a member, or any direct
or indirect partner or member of the Indemnified Party) in the year of or
within the two years subsequent to the year of the Loss, attributable to the
incurrence, accrual, or payment of such Losses. For purposes of determining
the year in which any such Tax benefit is actually realized by the Buyer, the
parties shall treat all other losses, deductions, and credits of the Buyer for
the applicable Post-Closing Tax Period as having been used prior to the Loss
giving rise to such Tax benefit. In the event that any Insurance Proceeds or
such Tax Benefits are received by an Indemnified Party after payment for the
related indemnification claim has been made pursuant to this Section 10, then
the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Sellers' Representative (for further
distribution to the Additional Indemnitors and/or the Blocker Seller, as
applicable) or the Buyer, as the case may be, an amount equal to the amount of
the Tax



\- 82 - Benefits or the reduction in Losses that would have been applied pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 10.4 had such Insurance Proceeds been
received at the time such indemnification claim was made. Each Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery from third
parties who may be responsible, in whole or in part, for Losses suffered by
such Indemnified Party and to make claims under insurance policies providing
coverage with respect to Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party.

10.4.2 Except in the case of (a) the Materiality Qualifiers contained within
any defined term that is defined or referenced in Section 1.2 of this
Agreement, and (b) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.5
(Financial Statements, Etc.) and clause (c) of Section 3.6 (Ordinary Course of
Business; No Material Adverse Effect), the parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that, for purposes of this Section 10, Materiality Qualifiers shall be
ignored in determining (i) whether a breach of a representation or warranty
has occurred and (ii) the amount of the applicable Losses arising from any
such breach. The parties hereto further agree that, for purposes of this
Section 10, all items listed on Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Letter shall be
ignored in determining (A) whether there is a claim under any Section 9.2
Matter and (B) the amount of the applicable Losses relating to any such claim.

10.5 Matters Involving Third Parties.

10.5.1 If any third party notifies any Indemnified Party with respect to any
matter that may give rise to a claim for indemnification against any
Indemnifying Party under this Section 10 (a "Third Party Claim"), then the
Indemnified Party will promptly notify in writing the Indemnifying Party of
such Third Party Claim describing in reasonable detail the basis for such
Third Party Claim (including identification of the provisions of this
Agreement alleged to have been breached and the amount of Losses incurred or
suffered, or expected to be incurred or suffered, with respect thereto) and
enclosing copies of any documents then available to the Indemnified Party
relating to such Third Party Claim and thereafter provide the Indemnifying
Party such documents and information with respect thereto that the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided, however, that no delay on
the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any indemnification obligation hereunder
unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
thereby. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will promptly deliver to the
Indemnifying Party following receipt thereof, copies of all notices, demands
and other documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim. This Section 10.5 shall not apply to the
conduct of any Tax Proceedings, which shall be exclusively governed by Section
9.7.

10.5.2 The Indemnifying Party will have the right to control the defense of
the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall have no right to assume the conduct or control of a
Third Party Claim (i) if the amount of Losses alleged in such Third Party
Claim are reasonably expected to exceed two times the remaining Escrow Funds
that are not then subject to the reasonably expected Losses alleged in other
pending indemnification claims made in accordance with this Section 10 (unless
the Indemnifying Party would be liable for amounts exceeding the remaining
Escrow Funds if such



\- 83 - Third Party Claim were indemnifiable); (ii) that seeks injunctive relief,
equitable remedies or other non-monetary remedies; (iii) that includes
criminal charges; or (iv) with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is also
a defendant and, under applicable principles of legal ethics, in the judgment
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict of interest exists or arises
that would prohibit a single counsel from representing both the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third
Party Claim. Within six (6) months of any election by the Indemnifying Party
to assume the conduct or control of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether such Indemnifying Party
acknowledges that such Third Party Claim is within the scope of such
Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations hereunder subject to the
limitations and qualifications contained herein. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party fails to acknowledge such indemnification obligations
within such six (6) month period, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to elect to takeover and assume the conduct and control of such Third Party
Claim from the Indemnifying Party, subject to Section 10.5.3 below. If the
Indemnified Party fails to provide written notice to the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement that it so elects to take over and
assume the conduct and control of such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15)
Business Days following the end of such six (6) month period, then the
Indemnified Party will be deemed to have waived such right to elect and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the defense of such Third
Party Claim.

10.5.3 If the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third Party
Claim, (a) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole
cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim (but
not of record, and shall not communicate with the Person asserting the Third
Party Claim or its Representatives), (b) the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim, nor take any voluntary action prejudicial to the
determination of the Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), and (c) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim unless (i) written agreement is obtained releasing the
Indemnified Party subject to the Third Party Claim from all liability
thereunder, (ii) it involves only the payment of money and (iii) the judgment
or settlement does not involve any finding or admission of a violation of any
Legal Requirement by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party is not
conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed).

10.5.4 Each party will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to,
reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim
and, subject to Section 11.16, will furnish or cause to be furnished such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.



\- 84 - 10.6 Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification under this Agreement, to the extent consistent with the common
law doctrine of mitigation. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers
will have no liability under any provision of this Agreement for any Loss to
the extent that such Loss relates to action or inaction by Buyer, any of the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing.
Each Buyer Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss by exhausting any
available remedies against insurers to the same extent as they would if such
Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an
insurance recovery is made by any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any
Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund
equal to the Insurance Proceeds (less the costs of recovery) shall be promptly
delivered to the Sellers' Representative for distribution to the Sellers.

10.7 Tax Treatment. The Buyer and the Sellers will treat any payment received
pursuant to Section 2.4, Section 2.5.5, Section 9.7, this Section 10, or any
release from the Escrow Account as a payment of, or an adjustment to, the
purchase price for the Blocker Shares and the Acquired Companies for Tax and
financial reporting purposes.

10.8 Acknowledgement by the Buyer.

10.8.1 The Buyer understands, acknowledges and agrees that, except for claims
of fraud (which claims shall, notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, be asserted solely against the individual Person that
committed such fraud), following the Closing, the indemnification provided to
Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, this Section 10 shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties against the Sellers or any of their respective
officers, directors, equity holders, agents, representatives or Affiliates or
any other Person, whether in law or in equity, with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no
other monetary remedy or recourse with respect to any of the foregoing other
than indemnification pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
Section 10.

10.9 Manner of Payment; Seller Reimbursement. Payment of any indemnification
obligations of RHC, the Additional Indemnitors and the Blocker Seller pursuant
to Section 10.2.1(a), subject in each case to the limitations in this Section
10, will be made solely from the Escrow Funds. Payment of any indemnification
obligations pursuant to Section 10.2.1(b) shall be made by the applicable
party, first out of such party's share of the Escrow Funds (based on its Pro
Rata Ratio) and then directly by such party. Any indemnification payment to be
made by the Buyer or any Additional Indemnitor or the Blocker Seller for
amounts in excess of the Escrow Funds pursuant to this Section 10 will be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Buyer or
such Additional Indemnitor or the Blocker Seller, as applicable, to the
account designated by the Sellers' Representative (in the case of a payment to
be made to a Seller Indemnified Party) or by the Buyer (in the case of a
payment to be made to a Buyer Indemnified Party), within five (5) Business
Days after such Losses have been determined by (a) a final, non-



\- 85 - appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b) a
written, executed agreement between the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative.

10.10 Subrogation. Upon making any payment to any Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this Section 10, the Indemnifying Party will
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights that the
Indemnified Party may have against other Persons with respect to the subject
matter of such claim for indemnification. The Indemnified Party shall take
such commercially reasonable actions as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party) for the
purpose of enabling the Indemnifying Party to perfect or exercise the
Indemnifying Party's right of subrogation hereunder.

(10) Business Days after delivery of such written notice of breach; provided,
however, that the Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement

Business Days after delivery of such notice of breach; provided, however, that

material breach of this Agreement or has otherwise breached the Agreement in a
manner that caused or resulted in such Buyer breach.

11.1.4 The Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers' Representative, on the
other hand, may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the
other at any time on or after December 31, 2016 (the "Expiration Date"), if
the Closing shall not have occurred by



\- 86 - the Expiration Date; provided, however, that (a) the Buyer shall not have the

with respect to the Sellers' obligations hereunder; and (c) neither party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.1.4 if that party's breach of any provision of the Agreement has caused or
resulted in the failure of the Closing to have occurred by the Expiration
Date.

11.1.5 Either the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers' Representative, on
the other hand, may terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to
the other if any Governmental Authority issues an order, decree, judgment,
ruling or injunction permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting the Contemplated Transactions and such order, decree, judgment,
ruling or injunction shall have become final and non-appealable; provided that
the Person seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 11.1.5 (or, in the

has fully complied with its obligations under Section 9.4.

11.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 11.1, all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder will
terminate without any liability of any party or any Affiliate thereof;
provided, however, that (a) the rights and obligations of the parties under
Section 9.3 (Confidentiality), Section 10.8 (Acknowledgement by the Buyer),
this Section 11.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 11.3 (Parent Termination
Fee), Section 1 (Definitions) and Section 12 (Miscellaneous), and the
Confidentiality Agreement, will, in each case, survive termination of this
Agreement and remain valid and binding obligations of the parties, and (b)
nothing herein will relieve any party to this Agreement from liability (i)
pursuant to the sections specified in this Section 11.2 that survive such
termination, (ii) subject to Section 10.8, for fraud or (iii) for any willful
breach of any representation, covenant or agreement contained herein occurring
prior to termination.

11.3 Parent Termination Fee. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
by, (a) either Buyer or Sellers' Representative pursuant to Section 11.1.5 as
a result of any final and nonappealable Order with respect to the HSR Act or

the conditions set forth in Section 7.4, solely with respect to the HSR Act,
Section 7.5(a), Section 8.4, solely with respect to the HSR Act, or Section
8.5(a) shall not have been satisfied, but all other conditions in Section 7
and Section 8 shall have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), then Parent shall pay to RHC
a fee equal to $40,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") by wire transfer of
same-day funds on the second (2nd) business day following such termination. In
the event that RHC shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 11.3,
the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Acquired
Companies, RHC or any Seller or their respective Affiliates or any other
Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated



\- 87 - hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any
matters forming the basis for such termination. For the avoidance of doubt,
any payment made by Parent under this Section 11.3 shall be payable only once
with respect to this Section 11.3 and not in duplication even though such
payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 11 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, RHP, RHC and the Sellers would not enter into this
Agreement. If Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due,
such fee shall also be deemed to include the costs and expenses incurred by
RHC, the Sellers and the Acquired Companies (including fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this
Section 11, together with interest on such unpaid fee, commencing on the date
that such fee became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest published in
the "Money Rates" section of The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such fee became due.

12.2 Provisions Concerning Sellers' Representative.

12.2.1 Appointment. Each Seller, each Reliant Indemnitor and each Additional
Indemnitor hereby irrevocably appoints the Sellers' Representative to serve
(and the Buyer hereby acknowledges that the Sellers' Representative will
serve) as the exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller,
such Reliant Indemnitor or such Additional Indemnitor for all purposes under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (including full power and authority to
act on behalf of such Seller, including each Selling Minority Holder and
Electing Minority Holder, Reliant Indemnitor or Additional Indemnitor).

12.2.2 Duties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing appointment,
the Sellers' Representative is authorized and empowered to:

(a) in connection with the Closing, receive all documents, instruments,
certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the name of each
Additional Indemnitor, each Reliant Indemnitor or Seller, including each
Selling Minority Holder and Electing Minority Holder, necessary or desirable
to effectuate the Closing and consummate the Contemplated Transactions;



\- 89 - (b) enter into and, if appropriate in its sole discretion, amend the Escrow
Agreement on behalf of the Sellers, Reliant Indemnitors and Additional
Indemnitors;

(c) execute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its sole discretion, on
behalf of each Seller, each Reliant Indemnitor and each Additional Indemnitor,
any amendment to this Agreement;

(d) take such action as it may deem appropriate in connection with any
disputes with any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions;

(e) take such action as it may deem appropriate in connection with the
defense, pursuit or settlement of any determinations relating to Cash on Hand
and Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.5 and consent to the
disbursement by the Escrow Agent of payments from the Escrow Funds in
connection therewith;

(f) engage and employ, on behalf of the Sellers, the Reliant Indemnitors and
the Additional Indemnitors, agents and representatives (including legal
counsel and other professionals) and incur such expenses as the Sellers'
Representative may in its sole discretion determine necessary or appropriate
in connection with the administration of the foregoing, at the expense of the
Sellers, the Reliant Indemnitors and the Additional Indemnitors, including the
Selling Minority Holders;

(g) pay or cause to be paid all expenses incurred or to be incurred by or on
behalf of the Sellers, the Reliant Indemnitors and the Additional Indemnitors
in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or establish such
reserves as the Sellers' Representative may from time to time determine, in
its sole discretion, to be necessary or desirable in connection with the
expenses and other costs to be borne by the Sellers, the Reliant Indemnitors
and the Additional Indemnitors hereunder, and direct the Buyer, or the Escrow
Agent, as the case may be, to make payment of such amounts to be applied to
such reserves in lieu of the payment to the Sellers, the Reliant Indemnitors
and the Additional Indemnitors hereunder;

(h) accept, deliver and receive instructions and notices required or permitted
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

(i) take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of any Seller, any
Reliant Indemnitor or any Additional Indemnitor and exercise any and all
rights that any Seller, any Reliant Indemnitor or Additional Indemnitor is
permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement; and

(j) take all other actions that are either necessary or appropriate in its
judgment for the accomplishment of the foregoing or contemplated by the terms
of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.



\- 90 - The Sellers' Representative will have no duties or responsibilities except for
those expressly set forth herein, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on behalf of any Seller,
any Reliant Indemnitor or any Additional Indemnitor will exist with respect to
the Sellers' Representative in its capacity as such.

12.2.3 Actions Binding. The agencies and proxies created hereunder by the
Sellers, Reliant Indemnitors, and Additional Indemnitors are coupled with an
interest and are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers'
Representative, and will survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Seller, any Reliant Indemnitor or any
Additional Indemnitor. All decisions and acts by the Sellers' Representative
will be binding upon the Sellers, the Reliant Indemnitors and the Additional
Indemnitors, including the Selling Minority Holders and Electing Minority
Holders, and no Seller, Reliant Indemnitor or Additional Indemnitor will have
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, any notice delivered or payment made
by the Buyer or the Escrow Agent to the Sellers' Representative will be
treated as having been delivered or made, as the case may be, to each Seller,
each Reliant Indemnitor and each Additional Indemnitor, including each Selling
Minority Holder, entitled thereto, regardless of the actions taken or not
taken by the Sellers' Representative following receipt of such notice or
payment.

12.2.4 Reliance. The Sellers' Representative is authorized to act on behalf of
the Sellers in accordance with the terms of this Section 12.2, notwithstanding
any dispute or disagreement with or among the Sellers, the Reliant Indemnitors
and the Additional Indemnitors. The Buyer and any other third party will be
entitled to rely on any and all actions taken by the Sellers' Representative
without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the Additional
Indemnitors, any of the Reliant Indemnitors and any of the Sellers, including
the Selling Minority Holders. The Buyer and any such other third party is and
will be fully protected and indemnified by the Sellers, the Reliant
Indemnitors and the Additional Indemnitors in acting or refraining from acting
upon and relying upon any notice, instruction, direction, request, waiver,
consent, receipt or other paper or document in writing that the Buyer or such
other third party in good faith reasonably believes has been signed by the
Sellers' Representative.

12.2.5 Liability of Sellers' Representative and Buyer Indemnified Parties;
Indemnification.

(a) Neither the Sellers' Representative, any Buyer Indemnified Party, nor any
of their respective Representatives will be liable to any Seller, Reliant
Indemnitor, or Additional Indemnitor, or any other Person, relating to the
performance of the Sellers' Representative's duties and obligations under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement for any errors in judgment, negligence,
oversight, breach of duty or otherwise, except to the extent it is determined
in a final and non-appealable order or judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not
taken by the Sellers' Representative constituted knowing, willful and
intentional misconduct. The Sellers' Representative and its Representatives
will be indemnified and



\- 91 - held harmless by the Sellers, Reliant Indemnitors, and the Additional
Indemnitors, severally, but not jointly or jointly and severally, each in
accordance with its respective Pro Rata Ratio, from and against any and all
losses, expenses and all other damages paid or otherwise incurred in any
action, suit, proceeding or claim to which the Sellers' Representative is made
a party by reason of the fact that the Sellers' Representative was acting as
such pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; provided, however,
that the Sellers' Representative will not be entitled to indemnification
hereunder to the extent it is determined in a final and non-appealable order
or judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing
evidence that the actions taken or not taken by or on behalf of the Sellers'
Representative constituted knowing, willful and intentional misconduct. The
Sellers' Representative will be fully protected in acting upon any notice,
statement or certificate believed by the Sellers' Representative to be genuine
and to have been furnished by the appropriate Person and in acting or refusing
to act on any matter unless such action constitutes knowing, willful and
intentional misconduct as determined in a final non-appealable order or
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing
evidence.

(b) The Sellers' Representative is serving in that capacity solely for
purposes of administrative convenience, and is not liable in such capacity for
any of the obligations of the Acquired Companies or the Sellers, Reliant
Indemnitors, or Additional Indemnitors hereunder and is not acting in a
fiduciary capacity with respect to any other Person in connection herewith;
and the Buyer agrees, on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties that none of
them will in any event look to the personal assets of the Sellers'
Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any
obligations to be performed by the Acquired Companies or the Sellers
hereunder.

(c) From and after the Closing, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any
liability to the Sellers' Representative or any Seller, Reliant Indemnitor, or
Additional Indemnitor for (i) the calculation of the Allocation Schedule or
(ii) any amounts that have been paid to the Sellers in accordance with the
terms of the Allocation Schedule and this Agreement.

12.2.6 Sellers' Representative Reserve. The Sellers' Representative will have
the right to recover, at its sole discretion, from the Sellers' Representative
Reserve and the Escrow Funds (but, in the case of the Escrow Funds, only out
of any funds remaining for disbursement to the Reliant Sellers from the Escrow
Account after the Escrow Termination Date pursuant to terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement), prior to any distribution to the Sellers, (i) the
Sellers' Representative's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees
and charges of counsel, accountants and other Representatives) incurred in
serving in that capacity and (ii) any amounts to which it is entitled pursuant
to the indemnification provision in Section 11.2.5(a) (each item in clauses
(i) and (ii) of this Section 11.2.6 referred to as a "Charge", and
collectively the "Charges"). In the event the amount of the Escrow Funds (to
the extent available therefor) and the Sellers' Representative Reserve
available to satisfy Charges (the "Remaining Escrow Property") is insufficient
to satisfy all Charges, then the Sellers shall, severally, but not jointly or
jointly and severally, each in accordance with its Pro



\- 92 - Rata Ratio, pay the Charges in excess of the Remaining Escrow Property. The
Sellers' Representative shall hold the Sellers' Representative Reserve on
behalf of the Sellers as an agent of the Sellers. At such time and from time
to time that the Sellers' Representative determines in its good faith
discretion that a portion of the Sellers' Representative Reserve will not be
required for the payment of such Charges, the Sellers' Representative shall
distribute to the Sellers, in accordance with the Allocation Schedule, such
applicable amounts from the Sellers' Representative Reserve (less any amounts
required to be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state and local
withholding Laws).

12.3 Expenses of Transaction. Whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are
consummated, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto will assume and bear all expenses, costs and fees
(including legal and accounting fees and expenses) incurred by such party in
connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution and performance of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions.

12.4 Entire Agreement. The agreement of the parties that is comprised of this
Agreement (including the Disclosure Letter and all Schedules and Exhibits
hereto) and the Escrow Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties and their respective Affiliates with respect
to the subject matter thereof and supersedes any and all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and communications (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement), whether oral or written, relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

12.5 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or under
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the Contemplated Transactions are not affected in any manner
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer will negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the end that the Contemplated Transactions are fulfilled in
accordance with the terms hereof to the greatest extent possible.

12.6 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified, but only by an
instrument in writing executed by each of the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative.

12.7 Parties in Interest. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of the parties hereto, and except as provided in Sections 9.6
(solely with respect to DandO Indemnified Persons), 10, 12.16 and 12.18, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will be construed to
or will confer upon any other Person any right, claim, cause of action,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, including by way of subrogation.

12.8 Assignment. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the successors and permissible assigns of the parties
hereto. This Agreement



\- 93 - and any rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned, hypothecated or
otherwise transferred by any party hereto (by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative; provided that the Buyer may assign any or all of its rights
(but none of its obligations) under this Agreement to a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Buyer. Any purported assignment in breach of this Section
12.8 shall be null and void.

12.9 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims arising in whole or in part
out of, related to, based upon, or in connection herewith or the subject
matter hereof or the Contemplated Transactions will be governed by, construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would
cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

12.10 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each party to this Agreement, by its execution
hereof, hereby irrevocably (a) submits, subject to Section 2.5, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or if, but only if,
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction, the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware) for the purpose of any and all Actions arising in whole
or in part out of, related to, based upon or in connection with this Agreement
or the subject matter hereof or the Contemplated Transactions, (b) waives to
the extent not prohibited by applicable law, and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is
not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such
action brought in one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds
of improper venue or forum non conveniens, should be transferred to any court
other than one of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the
pendency of some other proceeding in any other court other than one of the
above-named courts, or that this Agreement or any claims arising in whole or
in part out of, related to, based upon, or in connection herewith or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court, (c) agrees not
to commence any such Action other than before one of the above-named courts
nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause
the transfer or removal of any such action to any court other than one of the
above-named courts (subject in each case to clause (a) of this sentence)
whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise, (d) consents to
service of process in any such Action in any manner permitted by the laws of
the State of Delaware, (e) agrees that service of process made in accordance
with clause (d) or made pursuant to Section 12.1 will constitute good and
valid service of process in any such Action, and (f) waives and agrees not to
assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such Action any
claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (d) or clause (e)
does not constitute good and valid service of process. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, a party may commence an Action in any other
court to enforce an order or judgment issued by one of the courts described in
the immediately preceding sentence.

12.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, AND AGREES
TO CAUSE EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO WAIVE, AND



\- 94 - COVENANTS THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES SHALL ASSERT (WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DESCRIBED IN SECTION 12.10. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 12.11 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

12.12 Reliance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been
informed by each other party that the provisions of Sections 12.10 and 12.11
constitute a material inducement upon which such party is relying and will
rely in entering into this Agreement, and each such party agrees that any
breach by such party of any of the provisions of Sections 12.10 or 12.11 above
would constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

12.13 Specific Enforcement. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other parties would be damaged immediately, extensively and irreparably
and no adequate remedy at law would exist in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached or violated. Accordingly, in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy available to any
party, the parties agree that, without posting bond or similar undertaking,
each of the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement and the terms and provisions
hereof. Each party further agrees that, in the event of any action for
injunctive relief or for specific performance in respect of any breach or
violation, or threatened breach or violation, of this Agreement, it shall not
assert the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate or that specific
performance or injunctive relief in respect of such breach or violation should
not be available on any other grounds.

12.14 No Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a
waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar), or
shall constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. No
waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall be valid unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is intended to
be effective.

12.15 Negotiation of Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

12.16 Disclosure Letter. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure
Letter will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment that such information
is required to be listed in the Disclosure Letter or that such items are
material. The Disclosure Letter is arranged in



\- 95 - sections corresponding to the sections contained in this Agreement merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Disclosure
Letter as an exception to a particular representation or warranty will be
deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other
representations and warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item
to such other representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on its
face, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate cross-
reference thereto.

12.17 No Recourse Against Third Parties.

12.17.1 No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; provided
however, that the following Persons are expressly intended as third party
beneficiaries with respect to the following specified sections of this
Agreement and will have the right to enforce such specified sections against
the parties to this Agreement: with respect to Section 9.6, the Persons who
are the beneficiaries of the rights under such Section; with respect to
Section 10, the Persons who are the beneficiaries of the indemnification under
such Section; and with respect to Section 12.17.2, the Nonparty Affiliates.

12.17.2 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no claim
(whether at law or in equity, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise)
may be asserted by the Buyer, any Affiliate of the Buyer, or any Person
claiming by, through or for the benefit of any of them, against any Person who
is not party to this Agreement, including without limitation any
equityholders, partners, members, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, incorporators, managers, agents, Representatives, or Affiliates of
any Acquired Company, any Seller or the heirs, executors, administrators,
successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing) (each a "Nonparty Affiliate" and, collectively, the "Nonparty
Affiliates") with respect to any matters arising under or relating to the
Business, the Acquired Companies (including with respect to the operation of
their respective businesses prior to the Closing or any other transaction,
circumstance or state of facts involving the Acquired Companies prior to the
Closing), this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions or with respect to
any actual or alleged inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to
information furnished by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies or any
Nonparty Affiliate concerning the Business, the Acquired Companies (including
with respect to the operation of their respective businesses prior to the
Closing or any other transaction, circumstance or state of facts involving the
Acquired Companies prior to the Closing), this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions.

12.18 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted only for
reference as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit or describe
the scope or intent of this Agreement, and will not affect in any way the
construction, meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

12.19 Counterparts; Electronic Signature. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original for all purposes and
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. In the
event that a signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or



\- 96 - by e-mail or other electronic delivery of a ".pdf" or other electronic format
data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
party so executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the
same force and effect as if such facsimile, ".pdf" or other electronic format
signature page were an original thereof.

12.20 Parent Guarantee. Parent unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to take
any and all actions necessary to cause the Buyer to perform all of its
covenants, agreements and obligations under this Agreement, including with
respect to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and the payment
of consideration hereunder. Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Acquired
Companies and the Sellers the full and complete performance by the Buyer of
such covenants, agreements and obligations and shall be liable for any breach
by the Buyer of any such covenant, agreement or obligation. This is a
guarantee of payment and performance. Parent hereby waives diligence,
presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require
any proceeding first against the Buyer, protest, notice and all demands
whatsoever in connection with the performance of its covenants, agreements and
obligations set forth in this Section 12.20.

12.21 Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege.

12.21.1 Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that each of
Goodwin Procter LLP ("Goodwin") and Epstein Becker and Green, P.C. ("Epstein")
has acted as counsel to RHC, the Sellers, the Blocker, the Reliant Controlled
Entities, the Acquired Companies and certain members of the Sellers'
management (in their capacities as such), as applicable, in connection with
the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

12.21.2 Buyer hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Acquired
Companies and the Blocker (collectively, the "Conflict Parties") to consent
and agree to, Goodwin and/or Epstein representing the Sellers' Representative,
any of the Sellers, and members of RHP's management, as applicable
(collectively, the "Seller Conflict Parties") after the Closing, including
with respect to disputes in which the interests of the Seller Conflict Parties
may be directly adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Conflict
Parties), and even though Goodwin and/or Epstein may have represented the
Conflict Parties in a matter substantially related to any such dispute, or may
be handling ongoing matters for the Conflict Parties. Buyer further consents
and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Conflict Parties to consent and agree
to, the communication by Goodwin and/or Epstein to the Seller Conflict Parties
in connection with any such representation of any fact known to Goodwin and/or
Epstein, as applicable, arising by reason of Goodwin's and/or Epstein's prior
representation of the Conflict Parties. In connection with the foregoing,
Parent and Buyer hereby irrevocably waive and agree not to assert, and agrees
to cause the Conflict Parties to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) Goodwin's and/or
Epstein's prior representation of any of the Conflict Parties and (ii)
Goodwin's and/or Epstein's representation of the Sellers, the Acquired
Companies, RHC, the Blocker and the Sellers' Representative prior to and after
the Closing.



\- 97 - 12.21.3 Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Conflict Parties, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among Goodwin and/or Epstein, on the one hand, and the
Conflict Parties, the Sellers' Representative, any Seller and/or any
Additional Indemnitor, or any of their respective directors, officers
employees or other representatives, on the other hand, that relate in any way
to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement
(collectively, the "Privileged Communications") shall be deemed to be
attorney-client privileged and that the Privileged Communications and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto belong solely to the
Sellers' Representative and the Sellers, shall be controlled by the Sellers'
Representative on behalf of the Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Buyer or any of the Conflict Parties. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and
the Conflict Parties may delete or remove all documents, emails and other non-
email electronic documents concerning the negotiation or drafting of this
Agreement, or any other agreement previously contemplated by the Sellers
which, if consummated, would have resulted in a transaction substantially
similar to the ones contemplated by this Agreement, which are protected by the
attorney-client or work product privileges. It is acknowledged and agreed to
by the parties that a failure by the Sellers or the Conflict Parties to remove
materials identified in the foregoing sentence, to the extent that such
materials are otherwise protected by the attorney-client or work product
privileges, is inadvertent and that the Sellers shall, after receiving written
notice from Buyer of said failure, have ninety (90) days ("Recovery Period")
to request the return of such documents from Buyer. At all times prior to the
lapse of the Recovery Period, Buyer agrees to take no actions (and will cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Conflict Parties following the Closing) to
take no actions) with regard to the documents that would be inconsistent with
the Sellers' claims of privilege.
