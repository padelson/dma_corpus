<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt">AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June&nbsp;22, 2007 (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), is
made and entered into by and among Sentinel Omaha LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), Sentinel White Plains LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Subsidiary</U>&#148;), and America First Apartment Investors,
Inc., a Maryland corporation (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt">BACKGROUND



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, Parent, Subsidiary and the Company wish to provide for a merger of the Company with
and into Subsidiary (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the &#147;<U>MGCL</U>&#148;) and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the
"<U>Act</U>&#148;), whereby all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the &#147;<U>Company Common Stock</U>&#148;), issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than the shares of Company Common Stock owned directly or
indirectly by Parent, Subsidiary or the Company, will be converted into the right to receive $25.30
per share in cash (the &#147;<U>Common Stock Price</U>&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions declaring that the
Merger is advisable on substantially the terms and conditions set forth herein and directing that
the Merger be submitted for consideration at a meeting of its stockholders;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Managers of each of Parent and Subsidiary have approved this Agreement, and
Parent, the sole member of Subsidiary, has approved the Merger, in each case in accordance with the
Act;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the parties intend that for federal income tax purposes (and, where applicable, state
and local income tax purposes), the Merger shall be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all
of the Company&#146;s assets to Subsidiary in exchange for the Common Stock Price, followed by a
distribution of such Common Stock Price to the holders of Company Common Stock in a complete
liquidation of the Company pursuant to Sections&nbsp;331 and 562 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), and that this Agreement is hereby adopted as, and shall
constitute, a &#147;plan of liquidation&#148; of the Company within the meaning of Section&nbsp;562 of the Code;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has entered into an
Escrow Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Escrow Agreement</U>&#148;), with the
Company setting forth certain terms and conditions with respect to the liquidated damages amount
contemplated by Section&nbsp;8.2(f); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, Parent, Subsidiary and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

the Effective Time, in accordance with this Agreement, the MGCL and the Act, the Company shall be
merged with and into Subsidiary. At the Effective Time, the separate existence of the Company
shall cease and Subsidiary shall continue as the surviving entity in the Merger (the &#147;<U>Surviving
Entity</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.2. <U>Effective Time of the Merger</U>. Simultaneously with or as soon as

merger to be filed with and accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation
of Maryland (the &#147;<U>SDAT</U>&#148;) in accordance with Section&nbsp;3-107 of the MGCL (the &#147;<U>Merger
Filing</U>&#148;), and (ii)&nbsp;Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware in accordance with Section&nbsp;18-209 of the Act (the &#147;<U>Delaware Filing</U>&#148;).
The Merger shall become effective upon such time as the Merger Filing has been accepted for record
by the SDAT, or such later time as the parties hereto have agreed upon and designated in such
filing in accordance with the MGCL as the effective time of the Merger, but not to exceed 30&nbsp;days
after the Merger Filing is accepted for record by the SDAT (the &#147;<U>Effective Time</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.3. <U>Effects of the Merger</U>. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the MGCL, including Section&nbsp;3-114, and the Act, including

as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises, and all and every other interest of Subsidiary and the Company, shall vest in the
Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Subsidiary and the Company shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.4. <U>Closing</U>. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to effect the Merger set forth in this Agreement, a closing to
effectuate the consummation of the Merger (the &#147;<U>Closing</U>&#148;) shall take place at 10:00&nbsp;a.m.
local time on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set
forth in Article&nbsp;VII (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Clifford
Chance US LLP, 31 West 52<sup>nd</sup> Street, New York, New York, or at such other time or place
as Parent and the Company may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is sometimes referred to
in this Agreement as the &#147;<U>Closing Date</U>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.5. <U>Other Transactions</U>. Parent shall have the option, in its sole discretion
and without requiring the further consent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any of their
board of directors (or equivalent bodies), owners, partners or shareholders, upon reasonable notice
to the Company, to request that the Company, prior to the Closing, and upon such request the
Company shall, convert or cause the conversion of one or more Company Subsidiaries that are
organized as corporations into limited liability companies (or other entities), on the basis of
organizational documents as reasonably requested by Parent (each, a &#147;<U>Requested
Transaction</U>&#148;); <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that (i)&nbsp;none of the Requested Transactions shall delay or
prevent the completion of the Merger, (ii)&nbsp;the Requested Transactions shall be implemented as close
as possible to the Effective Time (but after all conditions to Closing set forth in Article&nbsp;VII
(other than conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived), (iii)&nbsp;neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to
take any action in contravention of any laws, (iv)&nbsp;the consummation of any such Requested
Transactions shall be contingent upon the receipt by the Company of a written notice from Parent
confirming that all of the conditions set forth in Sections&nbsp;7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied (or,
with respect to Section&nbsp;7.2, at the option of Parent, waived) and that Parent and Subsidiary are
prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing (it being understood that in any event the
Requested Transactions will occur prior to the Closing), (v)&nbsp;the Requested Transactions (or the
inability to complete the Requested Transactions) shall not affect or modify the obligations of
Parent and Subsidiary under this Agreement, (vi)&nbsp;neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall be required to take any such action that could adversely affect the qualification of the
Company as a &#147;real estate investment trust&#148; (a &#147;<U>REIT</U>&#148;) within the meaning of Section&nbsp;856 of
the Code, (vii)&nbsp;neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to take any such
action that could reasonably be expected to result in any Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse
Tax consequences to, any stockholder of the Company incrementally greater than the Taxes or other
adverse Tax consequences to such stockholders in connection with the consummation of this Agreement
in the absence of such action taken pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1.5 unless such stockholders are fully
and unconditionally indemnified by Parent and Subsidiary for such incremental Taxes and (viii)&nbsp;the
Requested Transactions shall not result in a reduction of the Common Stock Price. Promptly
following request by the Company, Parent shall advance to the Company all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs to be incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, promptly following request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in connection with any reasonable actions taken by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in accordance with this Section&nbsp;1.5. Parent and Subsidiary, on a joint and
several basis, hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Company Subsidiary and
each of their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents and other
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with or
as a result of taking such actions.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>ARTICLE III</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt">EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT



<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt">CORPORATIONS; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 3.1. <U>Conversion of Company Common Stock in the Merger</U>. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any holder of any stock of
Parent, Subsidiary or the Company:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;each previously-issued share of Company Common Stock that remains outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares required to be canceled pursuant to
Section&nbsp;3.1(b), automatically shall be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Price,
payable to the holder thereof, in each case without interest, and all such shares of Company Common
Stock, when so converted, no longer shall be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Common Stock Price per share therefor, without interest, upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.3; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;each share of Company Common Stock of the Company, if any, owned of record or
beneficially, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Subsidiary or held by any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity)
automatically shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no cash or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. As used in this Agreement, a
"<U>Company Subsidiary</U>&#148; means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture or other legal entity of which the Company (either directly or through or together with one
or more of the Company Subsidiaries) owns more than 50% of the stock, voting securities or
ownership or equity interest.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 3.2. <U>Subsidiary Units</U>. Each issued and outstanding common unit of Subsidiary
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be one
issued and outstanding common unit, of the Surviving Entity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 3.3. <U>Surrender and Exchange of Certificates</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the &#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;), and at
or prior to the Effective Time Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount equal
to the aggregate amounts payable under Sections&nbsp;3.1(a) and 3.6 (such amount to include the funds
previously subject to the Escrow Agreement, which shall be released to the Paying Agent at the
Effective Time). The funds so deposited with the Paying Agent shall be held by the Paying Agent
and applied by it in accordance with this Section&nbsp;3.3 and Section&nbsp;3.6.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;Not later than the first business day following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"<U>Company Certificates</U>&#148;), whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Common
Stock Price pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1(a), (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only
upon actual delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent reasonably may specify), and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the Common Stock Price. Upon
delivery to the Paying Agent of a Company Certificate, a duly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents specified in the instructions for use referred to above as the Paying Agent
reasonably shall require, the holder of such Company Certificates shall be entitled promptly to
receive in exchange therefor the Common Stock Price for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.1(a), and the Company Certificates so surrendered
shall be canceled. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock has occurred but
has not been registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check representing the aggregate
Common Stock Price applicable to those shares may be issued to the transferee if the Company
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent
accompanied by all documents and endorsements required to evidence and effect such transfer and by
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as provided in
this Section&nbsp;3.3, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Common Stock Price for each share of
Company Common Stock represented thereby. No interest will be paid or accrue on any amounts
payable upon surrender of any Company Certificate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;Promptly following the date that is one year after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent
shall deliver to Parent all cash and any documents in its possession relating to the transactions
described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agent&#146;s duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each
holder of a Company Certificate may surrender such Company Certificate to the Surviving Entity or
Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) receive in
exchange therefor the Common Stock Price, payable upon due surrender of the Company Certificate
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent,
Subsidiary, the Company or the Surviving Entity shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificate the Common Stock Price deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance with
this Article&nbsp;III; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion,
require the delivery of a reasonable indemnity or bond against any claim that may be made against
the Surviving Entity with respect to such Company Certificate or ownership thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 3.4. <U>Tax Withholding</U>. Each of Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or of Options such amounts as Parent or the
Surviving Entity is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving Entity, such withheld amounts (i)&nbsp;shall be
remitted by Parent or Surviving Entity, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority,
and (ii)&nbsp;shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Entity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 3.5. <U>Closing of the Company&#146;s Transfer Books</U>. At and after the Effective
Time, holders of Company Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the
Company, and the Company Share Certificates shall represent solely the right to receive the Common
Stock Price pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1(a), without interest. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after
the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company Certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Entity, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Common Stock Price in accordance with this Article&nbsp;III.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 3.6. <U>Options</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;As of the Effective Time, each option, warrant or other similar right to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock (each an &#147;<U>Option</U>&#148;) that then remains outstanding and originally was
granted under any Company Plan, whether or not then vested or exercisable, automatically shall be
terminated at the Effective Time and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive
thereupon in full satisfaction of such Option as of the Effective Time, an amount in cash (net of
any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (x)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of the Common
Stock Price over the applicable exercise price of such Option and (y)&nbsp;the number (determined
without reference to vesting requirements or other limitations on exercisability) of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will obtain all consents and make all amendments,
if any, to the terms of the Company Plans and each outstanding award agreement issued pursuant to
the Company Plans, as applicable, that are necessary to give effect to the provisions of this
Section&nbsp;3.6. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to make the payments required under this
Section&nbsp;3.6 at or as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 3.7. <U>No Right to Fair Value</U>. No dissenters&#146;, appraisal or other similar
rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby
so long as the provisions of Section&nbsp;3-202(c)(1) of the MGCL are applicable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 3.8. <U>Further Assurances</U>. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Subsidiary, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by
the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt">REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Subsidiary that, except as set forth in the
Company SEC Reports or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Company Disclosure Schedule</U>&#148;), and except as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 4.1. <U>Organization and Qualification</U>. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is qualified to
transact business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the
concept) in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned, licensed, used, leased or operated by
it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, a &#147;<U>Company Material Adverse Effect</U>&#148; means any event, circumstance, change or
effect that has a material adverse effect on the business, assets or financial condition of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than effects due to (i)&nbsp;general economic,
market or political conditions, (ii)&nbsp;matters generally affecting the industries or market sectors
in which the Company operates, (iii)&nbsp;the announcement or expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any impact on relationships with tenants or employees),

exchange. The Company does not have any earnings and profits attributable to it or any other
corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;857. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is or has been a party to any &#147;reportable transaction&#148; within the meaning of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and related rights to advancement of
expenses on the part of each person who at the Effective Time is a current or former director or
officer of the Company, including all such rights existing pursuant to the MGCL, the Company&#146;s
charter or bylaws or any written agreement between any such person and the Company in effect on the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect until
180&nbsp;days after the expiration of the longest applicable statute of limitation. Parent also agrees
that from and after the Effective Time it shall (and shall cause the Surviving Entity to) indemnify
all such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law with respect to all actual or
alleged acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time occurring in connection with or arising out
of such individuals&#146; service as officers or directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
as trustees, fiduciaries or administrators of any plan for the benefit of employees. Without
limitation of the foregoing, if any such person is or becomes involved in any such capacity in any
action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any actual or alleged action, inaction,
state of affairs or other matter, including any matter related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, occurring on or before the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Entity to) pay such person&#146;s reasonable fees and other expenses of counsel selected by
such person (including the cost of any investigation, preparation and settlement) incurred in
connection therewith promptly after statements therefor are received by Parent; provided that
person provides an undertaking to the Parent to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination shall have become final and not
appealable) that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Parent shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of any such action or proceeding, and counsel selected by the
indemnified person shall, to the extent consistent with their professional responsibilities,
cooperate with Parent and any counsel designated by Parent. Parent shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, that may be incurred by any indemnified
person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to maintain in
effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time the insurance coverage provided under
the policies of directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance maintained by the Company at the date
of this Agreement; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies
issued by reputable and financially sound carriers reasonably acceptable to the beneficiaries of
such policies that provide at least the same coverage, on terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to such persons but only if such substitution does not result in any gaps or lapses in
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; and <I>provided</I>, <I>further</I>, that
the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such coverage in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement; and if the
Surviving Entity is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section, it shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to such maximum amount. Parent&#146;s
obligations under this paragraph may be satisfied by the purchase of a &#147;tail&#148; insurance policy that
provides the coverage described above.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and cause the Surviving Entity to
honor, each Company Plan and the related funding arrangements of such Company Plan in accordance
with its terms and shall interpret such Company Plan in accordance with the past practice of the
Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall honor, and cause the
Surviving Entity to honor, all rights to vacation, personal and sick days accrued by employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries under any plans, policies, programs and arrangements of the
Company and its ERISA Affiliates through and including the Effective Time. Until the date that is
fifteen months after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, and cause the Surviving Entity to
provide, employee benefits under employee benefit plans to the employees and former employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those
provided to such persons pursuant to Company Plans on the date of this Agreement; <I>provided</I>,
<I>however</I>, that insofar as any Company Plan relates to severance or retention payments or other
related benefits (whether following a change of control transaction or otherwise), that Company
Plan or portion thereof shall be maintained in effect and honored by Parent and the Surviving
Entity in accordance with its terms. Nothing herein shall prohibit any changes to any Company Plan
that are (i)&nbsp;required by law (including any applicable qualification requirements of Section&nbsp;401(a)
of the Code); (ii)&nbsp;necessary as a technical matter to reflect the transactions contemplated hereby;
or (iii)&nbsp;required for the Surviving Entity to provide for or permit investment in its securities or
Parent&#146;s securities. Nothing herein shall require Parent to continue any particular Company Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;With respect to any employee benefit plans in which any employees of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in
which the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries did not generally participate
before the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i)&nbsp;waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the employees
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any such new plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Plan; (ii)
provide each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid before the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the
analogous Company Plan before the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any such new plan in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time; (iii)&nbsp;recognize all service of such employees for all
purposes (including, without limitation, purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting,
entitlement to benefits and benefit accrual) in any such new plan in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (iv)&nbsp;with respect to flexible spending
accounts, provide each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with a credit for any
salary reduction contributions made thereto and a debit for any expenses incurred thereunder with
respect to the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no officer, director,
employee, agent or representative of the Company makes any commitment to employees of the Company
regarding any employment, compensation or benefits to be provided after the Closing Date without
the advance written approval of the Parent, other than as specifically set forth in this Section
6.9. The Company will collaborate with Parent regarding communication to employees in order to
ensure a smooth transition in connection with the Merger.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Neither Parent, the Surviving Entity nor their respective affiliates shall take any action
from and after the Effective Time that is inconsistent with the Company&#146;s qualification as a REIT
within the meaning of Section&nbsp;856 of the Code before the Effective Time. After the Effective Time,
Parent, the Surviving Entity and their respective affiliates will take all necessary and desirable
actions to preserve the Company&#146;s qualification as a REIT for all periods before the Effective
Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;The aggregate Common Stock Price (plus all liabilities assumed by Parent or Subsidiary as
a result of the Merger) shall be allocated among the Company&#146;s assets in accordance with the
allocation set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule</U>. Parent shall
accommodate in good faith all reasonable modifications requested by the Company with respect to
such allocation. The parties further agree to report and file any Tax Returns, including IRS Form
8594 (or successor form), in all respects in a manner consistent with such allocation. The parties
shall cooperate in good faith to timely and properly prepare, execute and file any such forms.
None of the parties hereto shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise)
that is inconsistent with such allocation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;The Common Stock Price distributed to holders of the Company Common Stock will exceed the
Company&#146;s REIT taxable income within the meaning of Section 857(b) of the Code for the year in
which the Merger occurs (taking into account the dividends paid deduction for prior distributions
by the Company) and, assuming the payment of dividends in the maximum amounts permitted pursuant to
Section&nbsp;6.1(b)(D), except as described in <U>Section&nbsp;4.12(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule</U>, the Company will not owe any federal income tax for such year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;The parties hereto shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of and shall
duly and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed with any Governmental Authority,
including any Tax Returns regarding any conveyance or transfer taxes that may become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will cooperate with
Parent and Subsidiary to structure such transactions in a manner so as to minimize any conveyance,
real property transfer, mortgage, sales, recording, registration or similar taxes and fees that
become payable in connection with such transactions; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that (i)&nbsp;no such
cooperation or structuring shall delay or prevent the completion of the Merger, (ii)&nbsp;neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to take any action in contravention of any
laws, (iii)&nbsp;the Company shall not be required to take any action that could adversely affect the
qualification of the Company as a REIT under the Code and with the Company and Company
Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any actions that could reasonably be expected to result
in any Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax consequences to, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective stockholders incrementally greater than the Taxes or any
adverse consequences in connection with the consummation of this Agreement.

including a tender offer or exchange offer (each an &#147;<U>Alternative Transaction</U>&#148;) or enter

or consummates any such Alternative Transaction, and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(iii)&nbsp;if a tender offer or exchange offer constituting an Acquisition Proposal is consummated
prior to the termination of this Agreement, regardless of whether the Company&#146;s Board recommended

understood that any tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an Alternative Transaction that
is consummated on or after a termination of this Agreement shall result in a payment of the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section&nbsp;8.2(b)(ii).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;The amount of the Termination Fee shall be $8.43&nbsp;million.

terminated by Parent pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1(d)(ii) &#091;Company breach&#093; other than on account of a

the date of termination, the reasonable expenses and fees of the Parent not to exceed $1,000,000
(the &#147;<U>Parent Expenses</U>&#148;), and to the extent any Parent Expenses are paid by the Company to
Parent, such amount shall be deducted from any Company Termination Fee that may thereafter be
payable by the Company. The payment of Parent Expenses set forth in this Section&nbsp;8.2(d) is not an
exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the parties
hereto (whether at law or in equity), and in no respect is intended by the parties hereto to
constitute liquidated damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages payable, or in any other
respect limit or restrict damages available in case of any breach of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(e)&nbsp;The Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses shall be paid as directed by Parent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(f)&nbsp;The parties agree that the damages that would result from a breach by Parent or Subsidiary
of their obligations under this Agreement would be extremely difficult to determine. Accordingly,
the parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section&nbsp;8.1(c)(ii) &#091;breach by Parent or Subsidiary&#093; or Section&nbsp;8.1(c)(iii) &#091;failure to consummate
after conditions to Parent&#146;s obligations are satisfied&#093;, then Parent shall pay liquidated damages
in the amount of $25&nbsp;million to the Company. Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;8.2(f), the
liquidated damages shall be payable by Parent as directed by the Company pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three business days after the date
of such termination. Promptly following receipt of the liquidated damages, unless and solely to
the extent otherwise prohibited by law, the Company shall cause such amount to be distributed pro
rata to the holders of record, as of a date selected by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, of (i)
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)&nbsp;dividend equivalent rights issued pursuant to Company
Plans. The right to liquidated damages provided for in this paragraph shall be in lieu of any
other right of the Company to damages following a termination of this Agreement for any reason.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(g)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the amount of liquidated damages
payable to the Company pursuant to paragraph (f)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;8.2 in any taxable year of the
Company shall not exceed the sum (calculated for the Company&#146;s taxable year in which such amount is
received) of (A)&nbsp;the amount that it is determined should not be gross income to the Company for
purposes of the requirements of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code, with such determination to
be set forth in an opinion of outside tax counsel to the Company plus (B)&nbsp;such additional amount
that it is estimated can be paid to the Company in such taxable year without creating a risk that
the payment would cause the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Section&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Section&nbsp;856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code (&#147;<U>Qualifying Income</U>&#148;), which determination
shall be made by independent tax accountants to the Company, plus (C)&nbsp;if the Company receives a
letter from outside tax counsel to the Company indicating that the Company has received a ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service holding that the Company&#146;s receipt of the liquidated damages
either would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of the Company for
purposes of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code, the remaining balance of the liquidated
damages. Any amount of liquidated damages that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year
shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitation of this paragraph, provided that no such payment need be made after the fifth
anniversary of the date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company shall cease
to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, the entire unpaid
balance of the liquidated damages shall be payable immediately.
