AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 22, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made and entered into by and among Sentinel Omaha LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), Sentinel White Plains LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(" _Subsidiary_ "), and America First Apartment Investors, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the " _Company_ ").   

BACKGROUND    

WHEREAS, Parent, Subsidiary and the Company wish to provide for a merger of
the Company with and into Subsidiary (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "
_MGCL_ ") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _Act_ "),
whereby all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the shares of
Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Subsidiary or
the Company, will be converted into the right to receive $25.30 per share in
cash (the " _Common Stock Price_ ");   

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions
declaring that the Merger is advisable on substantially the terms and
conditions set forth herein and directing that the Merger be submitted for
consideration at a meeting of its stockholders;   

WHEREAS, the Managers of each of Parent and Subsidiary have approved this
Agreement, and Parent, the sole member of Subsidiary, has approved the
Merger, in each case in accordance with the Act;   

WHEREAS, the parties intend that for federal income tax purposes (and, where
applicable, state and local income tax purposes), the Merger shall be treated
as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets to Subsidiary
in exchange for the Common Stock Price, followed by a distribution of such
Common Stock Price to the holders of Company Common Stock in a
complete liquidation of the Company pursuant to Sections 331 and 562 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this
Agreement is hereby adopted as, and shall constitute, a "plan of liquidation"
of the Company within the meaning of Section 562 of the Code;   

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
entered into an Escrow Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the
" _Escrow Agreement_ "), with the Company setting forth certain terms and
conditions with respect to the liquidated damages amount contemplated by
Section 8.2(f); and   

WHEREAS, Parent, Subsidiary and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger.   

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:   

ARTICLE I    

THE MERGER    

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, in accordance with this Agreement, the MGCL
and the Act, the Company shall be merged with and into Subsidiary. At the
Effective Time, the separate existence of the Company shall cease and
Subsidiary shall continue as the surviving entity in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Entity_ ").   

SECTION 1.2. _Effective Time of the Merger_. Simultaneously with or as soon
as practicable following the Closing, (i) Parent and the Company shall cause
duly executed articles of merger to be filed with and accepted for record by
the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the " _SDAT_ ")
in accordance with Section 3-107 of the MGCL (the " _Merger Filing_ "), and
(ii) Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 18-209 of the Act (the "
_Delaware Filing_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon such time as the
Merger Filing has been accepted for record by the SDAT, or such later time as
the parties hereto have agreed upon and designated in such filing in
accordance with the MGCL as the effective time of the Merger, but not to
exceed 30 days after the Merger Filing is accepted for record by the SDAT
(the " _Effective Time_ ").   

SECTION 1.3. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the MGCL, including Section 3-114, and
the Act, including Section 18-209(g). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and
all and every other interest of Subsidiary and the Company, shall vest in
the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Subsidiary and
the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Entity.   

SECTION 1.4. _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to effect the Merger set forth
in this Agreement, a closing to effectuate the consummation of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time on the third
business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions
set forth in Article VII (other than conditions which, by their nature, are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions), at the offices of Clifford Chance US LLP, 31 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York, or at such other time or place as Parent and the
Company may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is sometimes referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."   

SECTION 1.5. _Other Transactions_. Parent shall have the option, in its sole
discretion and without requiring the further consent of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or any of their board of directors (or equivalent
bodies), owners, partners or shareholders, upon reasonable notice to the
Company, to request that the Company, prior to the Closing, and upon such
request the Company shall, convert or cause the conversion of one or more
Company Subsidiaries that are organized as corporations into limited
liability companies (or other entities), on the basis of organizational
documents as reasonably requested by Parent (each, a "
_Requested Transaction_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) none of the
Requested Transactions shall delay or prevent the completion of the Merger,
(ii) the Requested Transactions shall be implemented as close as possible to

ARTICLE III    

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT    

CORPORATIONS; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES    

SECTION 3.1. _Conversion of Company Common Stock in the Merger_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of any holder of any stock of Parent, Subsidiary or the Company:   

(a) each previously-issued share of Company Common Stock that remains
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares
required to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b), automatically shall be
converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Price, payable to the
holder thereof, in each case without interest, and all such shares of Company
Common Stock, when so converted, no longer shall be outstanding and
automatically shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Common Stock Price per share therefor, without interest, upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.3; and   

(b) each share of Company Common Stock of the Company, if any, owned of record
or beneficially, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Subsidiary or held by
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares held in a fiduciary capacity) automatically shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. As used in this Agreement, a "
_Company Subsidiary_ " means any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture or other legal entity of which the Company (either
directly or through or together with one or more of the Company Subsidiaries)
owns more than 50% of the stock, voting securities or ownership or equity
interest.   

SECTION 3.2. _Subsidiary Units_. Each issued and outstanding common unit of
Subsidiary that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall continue to be one issued and outstanding common unit, of the
Surviving Entity.   

SECTION 3.3. _Surrender and Exchange of Certificates_.   

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and at or prior to the Effective Time Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount equal to the aggregate
amounts payable under Sections 3.1(a) and 3.6 (such amount to include the
funds previously subject to the Escrow Agreement, which shall be released to
the Paying Agent at the Effective Time). The funds so deposited with the
Paying Agent shall be held by the Paying Agent and applied by it in
accordance with this Section 3.3 and Section 3.6.   

(b) Not later than the first business day following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company
Certificates_ "), whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Common Stock Price pursuant to Section 3.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent reasonably may specify), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates
in exchange for the Common Stock Price. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of
a Company Certificate, a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents specified in the instructions for use referred to above as the
Paying Agent reasonably shall require, the holder of such Company
Certificates shall be entitled promptly to receive in exchange therefor the
Common Stock Price for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby, in accordance with Section 3.1(a), and the
Company Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. If a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock has occurred but has not been
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check representing the
aggregate Common Stock Price applicable to those shares may be issued to the
transferee if the Company Certificate representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents
and endorsements required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as provided in this Section 3.3, each Company Certificate shall
be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender the Common Stock Price for each share
of Company Common Stock represented thereby. No interest will be paid or
accrue on any amounts payable upon surrender of any Company
Certificate.   

(c) Promptly following the date that is one year after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash and any documents in its
possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the
Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Company
Certificate may surrender such Company Certificate to the Surviving Entity
or Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the Common Stock Price, payable
upon due surrender of the Company Certificate without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Subsidiary,
the Company or the Surviving Entity shall be liable to a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amounts properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws.   

(d) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the Common
Stock Price deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance with this
Article III; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in
its discretion, require the delivery of a reasonable indemnity or bond
against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Entity with respect
to such Company Certificate or ownership thereof.   

SECTION 3.4. _Tax Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Entity shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or of Options such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Entity is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any other provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Surviving Entity, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or
Surviving Entity, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Authority, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock
or Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Surviving Entity.   

SECTION 3.5. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Certificates shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company, and the Company Share Certificates
shall represent solely the right to receive the Common Stock Price pursuant
to Section 3.1(a), without interest. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Entity, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Common Stock Price in accordance with this Article III.   

SECTION 3.6. _Options_.   

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option, warrant or other similar right to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each an " _Option_ ") that then
remains outstanding and originally was granted under any Company Plan,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, automatically shall be terminated
at the Effective Time and converted into the right of the holder thereof to
receive thereupon in full satisfaction of such Option as of the Effective
Time, an amount in cash (net of any applicable withholding taxes) equal to
the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Price over the
applicable exercise price of such Option and (y) the number
(determined without reference to vesting requirements or other limitations on
exercisability) of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Option.   

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will obtain all consents and make
all amendments, if any, to the terms of the Company Plans and each
outstanding award agreement issued pursuant to the Company Plans, as
applicable, that are necessary to give effect to the provisions of
this Section 3.6. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to make the payments
required under this Section 3.6 at or as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time.   

SECTION 3.7. _No Right to Fair Value_. No dissenters, appraisal or other
similar rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby so long as the provisions of Section
3-202(c)(1) of the MGCL are applicable.   

SECTION 3.8. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Subsidiary, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Subsidiary, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.   

ARTICLE IV    

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
the concept) in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned, licensed,
used, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in
this Agreement, a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event,
circumstance, change or effect that has a material adverse effect on the
business, assets or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, other than effects due to (i) general economic, market or

(a) The authorized stock of the Company consists solely of 375,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 125,000,000 shares of Excess Stock, par value
$0.01 per share (" _Company Excess Stock_ "). As of the close of business on
June 22, 2007, (i) 11,046,111 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, all of which were duly and validly issued and are fully

outstanding, the weighted average exercise price for all such outstanding
Options and the aggregate number of Options outstanding at each exercise
price.   

(c) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having
the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may

(d) Except for the Options, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
calls, contracts, scrip, commitments, understandings, restrictions,
arrangements, rights, warrants, stock appreciation or other rights
(contingent or other), including phantom stock rights or preemptive rights,
or rights of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument
or other agreement, obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
issue, deliver or sell, redeem or repurchase, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold or repurchased, additional shares of the stock of or
interests in the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such agreement
or commitment and there is no commitment of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to distribute to holders of any class of its stock, any dividends,
distributions, evidences of indebtedness or assets. There are no
voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or is bound with respect to the
voting of any shares of stock of the Company and no shares of stock of the
Company are subject to transfer restrictions imposed by or with
the knowledge, consent or approval of the Company, or other similar
arrangements imposed by or with the knowledge, consent or approval of the
Company, except for restrictions on transfer imposed by the Securities Act
and state securities laws. The Company Common Stock constitutes the only class
of equity securities of Company or its subsidiaries registered or required to
be registered under the Exchange Act.   

SECTION 4.3. _Ownership Interests in Other Entities_. The only Company
Subsidiaries are those listed in _Section 4.3 of the Company Disclosure

laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all
requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power
and authority to own, lease and otherwise hold its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of
or other ownership interests in, each Company Subsidiary are validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive or similar rights and are
owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any
Liens.   

SECTION 4.4. _Authority; Non-Contravention; Approvals_.   

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This

vote of holders of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter, in accordance with the requirements of the MGCL (the " _Company
Stockholders  Approval_"), the consummation by the Company of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Subsidiary,
constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by a courts
application of general equitable principles.   

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not violate, conflict with or result in a breach of
any provision of, or constitute a default under, or result in a right of
termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any
lien, claim, mortgage, charge, security interest, right of first refusal or
other encumbrance or third party claim (any of the foregoing, a " _Lien_ ")
upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (i) subject to receipt of
the Company Stockholders Approval, the Companys charter or bylaws; (ii)

properties or assets may be bound or affected other than (in the case of
clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above) any such violation, conflict, breach,
default, termination, acceleration or creation of Liens as would
not reasonably be expected, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   

(c) Except for (i) the filing with the SEC of a proxy statement (as amended
and supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and related proxy materials to
be used in soliciting the Company Stockholders Approval and the filing of

notice to, or authorization, consent, order or approval of, any federal,

a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or
the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, other than such declarations, filings, registrations,
notices, authorizations, consents, orders or approvals as, if not made
or obtained, as the case may be, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

contemplated by this Agreement.

Act_ ") or the Exchange Act. Since December 31, 2005, the Company has filed
with the SEC all Company SEC Reports required to be so filed under the
Exchange Act, and each such Company SEC Report complied in all
material respects, when filed, with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act (including the applicable rules and regulations thereunder). As
of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Company Subsidiaries is required, under the Exchange Act or by contract, to
make periodic filings with the SEC.   

(b) The audited and unaudited financial statements of the Company included in
the Company SEC Reports (the " _Company Financial Statements_ ") were

principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a basis consistent with prior periods
(except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto, or as may be
permitted by the rules and regulations applicable to quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q) and fairly present in all material respects the financial position
and results of operations of the Company and its consolidated Company
Subsidiaries at the dates and for the periods indicated (subject, in the

executive officer of the Company and the principal financial officer of the
Company have made the certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the

SEC thereunder with respect to each Company SEC Report subject to that

the Company Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC.
Since January 1, 2004, the Company has not received notice from the SEC that

incurred in the ordinary course of business, (ii) would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (iii) have been
discharged or paid in full or will have been discharged or paid in full prior

Company Subsidiary has been a party to any asset securitization transaction
or "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Rule 303 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Exchange Act). As used in this Agreement, " _to the
knowledge of the Company_ " means to the actual knowledge of the persons named
in  _Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.   

SECTION 4.7. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the date of the
most recent balance sheet included in the Company Financial Statements
through the date of this Agreement, and except as disclosed in any Company
SEC Report filed before the date of this Agreement, (a) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has suffered or experienced any change, event or
development that has had a Company Material Adverse Effect; (b) the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; and (c) there has not
occurred (i) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend,

the Company (other than regular quarterly dividends), or any repurchase,

stock or other securities of, or other ownership interests in, the Company;
(ii) any split, combination, subdivision or reclassification of any of the
Companys stock or issuance or authorization of issuance of any other

amendment of any term of any outstanding security of the Company; or (iv) any
change by the Company in financial accounting principles, practices or
methods, except as required by GAAP or by a change of law, statute, rule or
regulation.   

SECTION 4.8. _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) there are no
claims, suits, actions, arbitrations, mediations, investigations or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their respective
properties or assets or any director, officer or employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or other person, in each case for whom the Company or
any Company Subsidiary may be liable that reasonably would be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially adversely affect the
Companys ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement and (ii)
the Company is not subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule, order
or award of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator that prohibits or would
reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of the Merger.   

SECTION 4.9. _Information Supplied_. The definitive Proxy Statement will not,
on the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading and will not, at the time of the meeting of the Companys
stockholders to which the Proxy Statement relates (the " _Stockholders
Meeting_ "), omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation
of proxies for the Stockholders Meeting that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. The definitive Proxy Statement will, when
filed by the Company with the SEC, comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes
no representation or warranty with respect to any information that may be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Subsidiary and included in the Proxy
Statement.   

SECTION 4.10. _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. The Company is not in violation
of, nor since December 31, 2005 has it received any written notice of
violation of, any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance
or judgment of any Governmental Authority, except for violations that would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses,
franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other governmental
authorizations, certificates, consents and approvals necessary to conduct
their businesses as presently conducted and to own their assets and
properties (collectively, the " _Company Permits_ "), except for such

Permit, except for such violations as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

to taxation by that jurisdiction. No requests for waivers of any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes have been made and no extensions of the time
to assess or collect any such Tax are pending and no such waiver remains in
effect. There are no liens for any material Taxes upon the assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary except for statutory liens for Taxes not

the knowledge of Company no audit, examination, action or proceeding in
respect of any material Taxes involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary

collection of any material Tax has been assessed against the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

that could obligate them to make any payments that will not be deductible
under Code Sections 162(m) or 280G.

any provision of similar effect) including, without limitation, any Tax
arising from a prohibited transaction described in Code Section 857(b)(6).
To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists which presents a risk that any material Tax described in
the preceding sentence will be imposed on the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. No asset or portion thereof held directly or indirectly by
the Company is subject to the "built in gains tax" under Code Section 1374
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7 or any applicable
predecessor guidance or regulation.   

(g) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) is a party to
or is otherwise subject to any Tax allocation, indemnity or sharing agreement
or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of another person (1) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), (2) as a transferee or successor or (3) under law, by contract
or otherwise. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to
any adjustment under Section 481 of the Code.   

(h) The Company, (i) for all taxable years commencing with the Companys
taxable year ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2006 has been
subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within
the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT for such years and (ii) has been owned and operated
since December 31, 2006 and will continue to be owned and to operate in a
manner that will permit it to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year of the
Company that will end upon the Effective Time independent of (and without
compliance with or reliance upon) any procedure for payment of a deficiency
or other post-Closing dividend. No challenge to the Companys qualification as
a REIT is pending or has been threatened in writing. No Company Subsidiary is
a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation
that qualifies as a "qualified REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code, or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," within the
meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code. Each Company Subsidiary that is
a partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company has been since its
formation treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or
disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an
association taxable as a corporation. Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists all the Company Subsidiaries which are (i) "taxable REIT
subsidiaries" within the meaning of Code Section 856(l) or (ii) "qualified
REIT subsidiaries" within the meaning of Code Section 856(i).

another person, or has had its stock distributed by another person, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Code Section 355\. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
has disposed of any property in a transaction intended to qualify for tax
deferred treatment under Code Section 1031 or 1033 in which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, has yet to acquire a replacement
property or has not otherwise completed such exchange. The Company does not
have any earnings and profits attributable to it or any other corporation in
any non-REIT year within the meaning of Code Section 857\. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is or has been a party to any "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b).

current summary plan descriptions and subsequent summaries of material
modifications with respect to each Company Plan for which such descriptions
and modifications are required under ERISA; and (iv) the most recent IRS
determination letter for each Pension Plan that is intended to be qualified

4.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

within the previous six years, maintained a Pension Plan that is subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA.

Labor, any Governmental Authority or any participant or beneficiary (other

operation of the Company Plans; and (ii) the Company has made all material
contributions required under the terms of such Company Plans.

advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using its reasonable
best efforts to (i) make any filing with and obtain any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental

contemplated by this Agreement.   

SECTION 6.3. _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Meeting of Stockholders_.   

(a) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, prepare and file a preliminary form of the Proxy Statement
with the SEC and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff, and to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly
as reasonably practicable after responding to all such comments to the
satisfaction of the SECs staff. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Merger. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting
there shall occur any event that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
prepare, and, after consultation with Parent, mail to its stockholders such
an amendment or supplement. Parent shall cooperate fully with the Company in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto
and shall furnish the Company, promptly upon the Companys request, with all
information reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in, or
otherwise in respect of, the Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement
and the related proxy materials and any proposed amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement prior to its filing with the SEC or dissemination to the
Companys stockholders.   

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties
shall correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement, if and to the extent any such information shall be or have become
false or misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps
necessary to correct the same and to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected
to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case to the extent
required by applicable law or otherwise deemed appropriate by the
Company.   

(c) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable law and its charter and
bylaws, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date on which the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the staff of the SEC, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholders Approval. Subject to the duties of the
Companys Board of Directors under applicable law, the Company shall include
in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of its Board of Directors that the
Company Stockholders Approval be given (the " _Recommendation_ ").   

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (c) of this Section
6.3, at any time before the approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Recommendation may be withdrawn or
modified, and the Stockholders Meeting may be postponed, if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after taking into account the advice of
the Companys outside legal counsel, that the withdrawal or modification of
such recommendation or the postponement of the Stockholders Meeting, as
applicable, is appropriate and consistent with the obligations of the
Companys Board of Directors under applicable law.   

(e) The Company shall not be required to hold the Stockholders Meeting if this
Agreement is terminated before that meeting is held.   

SECTION 6.4. _Public Statements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the
NASDAQ Global Market or any other securities exchange, none of the parties to
this Agreement will cause or permit any public announcement with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. The initial press release with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
require the prior mutual agreement and approval of both Parent and the
Company and any subsequent press releases or other public statements with
respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be made, subject to the preceding sentence, only
following prior consultation between Parent and the Company.   

SECTION 6.5. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.   

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents to, afford to Parent and its officers, directors,
employees, consultants, agents, advisors and other representatives
(collectively " _Parent Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal
business hours with reasonable notice throughout the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time to all of the Companys properties,
offices and other facilities, books, contracts, commitments, records
(including, but not limited to, Tax Returns and records), directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives and, during that period, shall
furnish promptly to Parent or Parents Representatives such other information
concerning the Companys business, properties and personnel as Parent
reasonably may request. Except as required by law, Parent and Subsidiary
shall hold, and shall cause the Parent Representatives to hold, in
strict confidence all nonpublic documents and confidential information
furnished to Parent, Subsidiary and any Parent Representative in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement dated as of April 9, 2007 between the Company
and Sentinel Real Estate Corp. (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").   

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants,
agents, advisors and other representatives to provide, all reasonable
cooperation in connection with (A) the arrangement of the Parents financing,
including assisting Parent in seeking consents from the Companys existing
lenders, and (B) the sale or other disposition after the Effective Time of
any of the properties of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, in each
case as may be reasonably requested by Parent.   

SECTION 6.6. _Acquisition Proposals_.   

(a) As used in this Agreement:   

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer, whether in one
transaction or a series of related transactions (i) for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination
involving the Company, (ii) for the issuance of 25% or more of the equity
securities of the Company as consideration for the assets or securities of
another person or (iii) to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 25%
or more of the equity securities of the Company or assets (including equity
securities of any Company Subsidiary) that represent 25% or more of the
assets of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated
by or expressly permitted under this Agreement; and   

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal (but replacing
references to "25% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal with
"50% or more") on terms that the Companys Board of Directors determines in
good faith after consultation with the Companys financial advisor to be
superior from a financial point of view to the Merger, taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, and including in
each case the risks and probabilities of consummation).   

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.6, until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, advisors and
other representatives (collectively " _Company Representatives_ ")
shall, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage (including
by way of providing information) the submission of any Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiries, proposals or offers that reasonably may be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations
with respect thereto or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in,
or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations, or
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in
principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or share
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement providing for
or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or
agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations
hereunder or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall,
and shall direct each Company Subsidiary and each agent or representative of
any of the foregoing to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations, or
communications with any party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.   

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.6(b), until the
Company Stockholders Approval is obtained, (i) if the Company has received
from a third party an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the
Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith constitutes or
reasonably could be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the person making the Acquisition Proposal (pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person,
in the aggregate, than the Confidentiality Agreement) and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with such person regarding the Acquisition
Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall promptly provide
to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that is provided to any person pursuant to this Section
6.6(c) and was not previously provided to Parent; and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company or
its Board of Directors may grant waivers, consents or approvals under any
standstill agreement to facilitate any unsolicited Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that waivers, consents or approvals of the same type and scope
are simultaneously made with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement.   

(d) The Company promptly shall advise Parent of its receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal.   

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, at any
time before obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval, the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action may
be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.6(e) and any purported termination pursuant to this Section
6.6(e) shall be void, unless concurrently with such termination the Company
pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.6(e) unless the Company (i) shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least 72 hours in advance, of its intention to terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making the Superior Proposal), and shall be accompanied by a copy of a draft
of the definitive agreement proposed to be entered into with respect to the
Superior Proposal, (ii) after delivering such notice of a Superior Proposal
the Company shall provide Parent at least three (3) business days to make
such adjustment in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and shall
negotiate, and cause its legal and financial advisors to negotiate the terms
of such adjustments, and (iii) the Companys Board of Directors shall have
determined, after the end of such three business day period, after
considering the results of any such negotiations and the revised proposals
made by Parent, if any, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such notice
continues to be a Superior Proposal.   

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any other
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the case of any disclosure
described in this clause (ii), the Companys Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to
disclose may be inconsistent with the obligations of the Company or its Board
of Directors under applicable law.   

SECTION 6.7. _Expenses and Fees_. Subject to Section 8.2(d), whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses.   

SECTION 6.8. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.   

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and related rights to
advancement of expenses on the part of each person who at the Effective Time
is a current or former director or officer of the Company, including all such
rights existing pursuant to the MGCL, the Companys charter or bylaws or any
written agreement between any such person and the Company in effect on
the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect until 180 days after the expiration of the longest
applicable statute of limitation. Parent also agrees that from and after the
Effective Time it shall (and shall cause the Surviving Entity to)
indemnify all such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
with respect to all actual or alleged acts or omissions prior to the
Effective Time occurring in connection with or arising out of such
individuals service as officers or directors of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or as trustees, fiduciaries or administrators of any plan for
the benefit of employees. Without limitation of the foregoing, if any such
person is or becomes involved in any such capacity in any action, proceeding
or investigation in connection with any actual or alleged action,
inaction, state of affairs or other matter, including any matter related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, occurring on or before the
Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Entity to) pay
such persons reasonable fees and other expenses of counsel selected by such
person (including the cost of any investigation, preparation and settlement)
incurred in connection therewith promptly after statements therefor are
received by Parent; provided that person provides an undertaking to the
Parent to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction (which determination shall have become final and
not appealable) that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Parent
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such action or
proceeding, and counsel selected by the indemnified person shall, to the
extent consistent with their professional responsibilities, cooperate with
Parent and any counsel designated by Parent. Parent shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, that may be
incurred by any indemnified person in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for in this Section.   

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
to maintain in effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time the
insurance coverage provided under the policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company at the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor
policies issued by reputable and financially sound carriers reasonably
acceptable to the beneficiaries of such policies that provide at least the
same coverage, on terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to such
persons but only if such substitution does not result in any gaps or lapses
in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving Entity shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement; and if
the Surviving Entity is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
annual premium equal to such maximum amount. Parents obligations under this
paragraph may be satisfied by the purchase of a "tail" insurance policy
that provides the coverage described above.   

SECTION 6.9. _Employee Benefits_.   

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and cause the
Surviving Entity to honor, each Company Plan and the related funding
arrangements of such Company Plan in accordance with its terms and shall
interpret such Company Plan in accordance with the past practice of
the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
honor, and cause the Surviving Entity to honor, all rights to vacation,
personal and sick days accrued by employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries under any plans, policies, programs and arrangements of
the Company and its ERISA Affiliates through and including the Effective
Time. Until the date that is fifteen months after the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide, and cause the Surviving Entity to provide, employee benefits
under employee benefit plans to the employees and former employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are in the aggregate no less
favorable than those provided to such persons pursuant to Company Plans on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that insofar as any
Company Plan relates to severance or retention payments or other related
benefits (whether following a change of control transaction or otherwise),
that Company Plan or portion thereof shall be maintained in effect and
honored by Parent and the Surviving Entity in accordance with its terms.
Nothing herein shall prohibit any changes to any Company Plan that are (i)
required by law (including any applicable qualification requirements of
Section 401(a) of the Code); (ii) necessary as a technical matter to reflect
the transactions contemplated hereby; or (iii) required for the Surviving
Entity to provide for or permit investment in its securities or Parents
securities. Nothing herein shall require Parent to continue any particular
Company Plan.   

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans in which any employees of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries first become eligible to participate on
or after the Effective Time, and in which the employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries did not generally participate before the Effective
Time, Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under
any such new plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Plan;
(ii) provide each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid before the Effective Time (to
the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Plan before
the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any such new plan in which such employees may be eligible
to participate after the Effective Time; (iii) recognize all service of such
employees for all purposes (including, without limitation, purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and benefit
accrual) in any such new plan in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time; and (iv) with respect to flexible
spending accounts, provide each employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with a credit for any salary reduction contributions made
thereto and a debit for any expenses incurred thereunder with respect to the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits.   

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no
officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the Company makes any
commitment to employees of the Company regarding any employment, compensation
or benefits to be provided after the Closing Date without the advance written
approval of the Parent, other than as specifically set forth in this
Section 6.9. The Company will collaborate with Parent regarding communication
to employees in order to ensure a smooth transition in connection with the
Merger.   

SECTION 6.10. _Certain Tax Matters_.   

(a) Neither Parent, the Surviving Entity nor their respective affiliates shall
take any action from and after the Effective Time that is inconsistent with
the Companys qualification as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of
the Code before the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Parent, the
Surviving Entity and their respective affiliates will take all necessary and
desirable actions to preserve the Companys qualification as a REIT for all
periods before the Effective Time.   

(b) The aggregate Common Stock Price (plus all liabilities assumed by Parent
or Subsidiary as a result of the Merger) shall be allocated among the
Companys assets in accordance with the allocation set forth in _Section
6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. Parent shall accommodate in good
faith all reasonable modifications requested by the Company with respect
to such allocation. The parties further agree to report and file any Tax
Returns, including IRS Form 8594 (or successor form), in all respects in a
manner consistent with such allocation. The parties shall cooperate in good
faith to timely and properly prepare, execute and file any such forms. None
of the parties hereto shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns
or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation.   

(c) The Common Stock Price distributed to holders of the Company Common Stock
will exceed the Companys REIT taxable income within the meaning of Section
857(b) of the Code for the year in which the Merger occurs (taking into
account the dividends paid deduction for prior distributions by the Company)
and, assuming the payment of dividends in the maximum amounts permitted
pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(D), except as described in _Section 4.12(f) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_, the Company will not owe any federal income
tax for such year.   

(d) The parties hereto shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of and shall duly and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed
with any Governmental Authority, including any Tax Returns regarding any
conveyance or transfer taxes that may become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will cooperate
with Parent and Subsidiary to structure such transactions in a manner so as
to minimize any conveyance, real property transfer, mortgage, sales,
recording, registration or similar taxes and fees that become payable in
connection with such transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no
such cooperation or structuring shall delay or prevent the completion of the
Merger, (ii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required
to take any action in contravention of any laws, (iii) the Company shall not
be required to take any action that could adversely affect the qualification
of the Company as a REIT under the Code and with the Company and
Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any actions that could
reasonably be expected to result in any Taxes being imposed on, or any
adverse Tax consequences to, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of
their respective stockholders incrementally greater than the Taxes or
any adverse consequences in connection with the consummation of this
Agreement.

SECTION 8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, whether before or
after receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval:   

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;   

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:   

(i) the Closing has not occurred on or before November 30, 2007 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to
any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has been the cause
of, or resulted in, or materially contributed to, the failure to hold the
Closing on or before the Termination Date;   

(ii) any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling, judgment,
decision, order or injunction of or by any court or other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction that makes the consummation of the Merger
illegal shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither party may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) unless that party first shall have used
its reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of and to procure the
removal, reversal, dissolution, setting aside or invalidation of any such
order, decree, ruling, judgment, decision, order or injunction;   

(iii) the Stockholders Meeting shall have been duly held and the votes cast at
the Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment thereof) shall be
insufficient to constitute the Company Stockholders Approval;   

(c) by the Company:   

(i) in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.6(e), after giving Parent
written notice that the Companys Board of Directors has approved, endorsed
or recommended that the Company enter into, or that the Company has entered
into, a definitive agreement providing for a transaction that is a Superior
Proposal;   

(ii) if (A) there shall have been a breach of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement of Parent or Subsidiary or (B) Parent or Subsidiary shall
not have performed or complied with any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, in either case such that the condition set forth in Section
7.3(a) or (b), as the case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by
the Termination Date;   

(iii) if the Company is ready, willing and able to close and the Effective
Time shall not have occurred within eight business days after the first date
upon which all of the conditions to Parents obligations to consummate the
Merger (other than conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at
the Closing) are satisfied or waived;   

(d) by Parent, if:   

(i) (A) the Companys Board of Directors has approved, endorsed or recommended
that the Company enter into, or the Company has entered into a definitive
agreement providing for a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, (B) the
Companys Board of Directors withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Recommendation, (C) a tender offer or exchange offer for any
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal is commenced prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and the Companys Board of Directors recommends acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders, or (D) the Company or the
Companys Board of Directors publicly announces its intention to do any
of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that for this purpose neither (x)
disclosure of any Acquisition Proposal that is not being recommended by the
Companys Board of Directors nor (y) disclosure of any other facts or
circumstances that is not accompanied by a statement that the Companys Board
of Directors has withdrawn or modified the Recommendation, shall be
considered to be a withdrawal or modification of the Recommendation;   

(ii) (A) there shall have been a breach of any representation or warranty in
this Agreement of the Company or (B) the Company shall not have performed or
complied with any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, in
either case such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b), as
the case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by the Termination
Date; or   

SECTION 8.2. _Effect of Termination_.   

(a) Upon a termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1, this Agreement forthwith shall
become void and there shall be no liability or further obligation under or in
respect of this Agreement on the part of the Company, Parent, Subsidiary or
their respective officers or directors, other than the last sentence
of Section 6.5, Section 6.7, this Section 8.2 and Article IX, all of which
shall survive; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing contained in this
Section 8.2(a) shall relieve any party from liability arising out of any
willful breach of any its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.   

(b) The Company agrees that a fee (a " _Termination Fee_ ") shall be payable
by it under the following circumstances:   

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(i) [superior proposal] or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i)
[alternate transaction] or Section 8.1(d)(ii) [Company breach] solely on
account of a breach by the Company of Section 6.6 hereof, the Termination Fee
shall be payable immediately upon such termination,   

(ii) if this Agreement (A) is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(i) [termination date], (B) is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) [failed vote], or (C) is terminated by
the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) [Company breach] other than on
account of a breach of Section 6.6 hereof, and (X) if prior to such
termination an Acquisition Proposal by a third party has been publicly
disclosed or announced and not subsequently withdrawn and (Y) within one year
after any such termination of this Agreement the Company shall consummate a
transaction relating to any Acquisition Proposal (but replacing references to
"25% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal with "33% or
more") including a tender offer or exchange offer (each an " _Alternative
Transaction_ ") or enter into any agreement relating to any Alternative
Transaction, then in any of the cases referred to in clauses (A), (B) or (C),
the Company shall pay the Termination Fee immediately upon the earlier of the
date upon which the Company enters into such agreement relating to an
Alternative Transaction or consummates any such Alternative Transaction,
and   

(iii) if a tender offer or exchange offer constituting an Acquisition Proposal
is consummated prior to the termination of this Agreement, regardless of
whether the Companys Board recommended for or against acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer or took no position with respect thereto, the
Termination Fee shall be payable immediately upon such consummation; it
being understood that any tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an
Alternative Transaction that is consummated on or after a termination of this
Agreement shall result in a payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 8.2(b)(ii).   

(c) The amount of the Termination Fee shall be $8.43 million.   

(d) If this Agreement (A) is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(iii) [failed vote] and if prior to such termination an
Acquisition Proposal by a third party has been publicly disclosed or
announced and not subsequently withdrawn, or (B) is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) [Company breach] other than on account of
a breach of Section 6.6 hereof, the Company shall pay to Parent within three
(3) business days after the date of termination, the reasonable expenses and
fees of the Parent not to exceed $1,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), and
to the extent any Parent Expenses are paid by the Company to Parent, such
amount shall be deducted from any Company Termination Fee that may thereafter
be payable by the Company. The payment of Parent Expenses set forth in this
Section 8.2(d) is not an exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other
rights or remedies available to the parties hereto (whether at law or in
equity), and in no respect is intended by the parties hereto to constitute
liquidated damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages payable, or in
any other respect limit or restrict damages available in case of any breach
of this Agreement.   

(e) The Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses shall be paid as directed by
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds.   

(f) The parties agree that the damages that would result from a breach by
Parent or Subsidiary of their obligations under this Agreement would be
extremely difficult to determine. Accordingly, the parties agree that if this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) [breach
by Parent or Subsidiary] or Section 8.1(c)(iii) [failure to consummate after
conditions to Parents obligations are satisfied], then Parent shall pay
liquidated damages in the amount of $25 million to the Company. Subject to
the provisions of Section 8.2(f), the liquidated damages shall be payable by
Parent as directed by the Company pursuant to the Escrow Agreement by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within three business days after the
date of such termination. Promptly following receipt of the liquidated
damages, unless and solely to the extent otherwise prohibited by law, the
Company shall cause such amount to be distributed pro rata to the holders of
record, as of a date selected by the Companys Board of Directors, of
(i) shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) dividend equivalent rights issued
pursuant to Company Plans. The right to liquidated damages provided for in
this paragraph shall be in lieu of any other right of the Company to damages
following a termination of this Agreement for any reason.   

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the amount of
liquidated damages payable to the Company pursuant to paragraph (f) of this
Section 8.2 in any taxable year of the Company shall not exceed the sum
(calculated for the Companys taxable year in which such amount is received)
of (A) the amount that it is determined should not be gross income to the
Company for purposes of the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code, with such determination to be set forth in an opinion of outside tax
counsel to the Company plus (B) such additional amount that it is estimated
can be paid to the Company in such taxable year without creating a risk
that the payment would cause the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Section 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3)
of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), which determination shall be made by
independent tax accountants to the Company, plus (C) if the Company receives
a letter from outside tax counsel to the Company indicating that the Company
has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service holding that the
Companys receipt of the liquidated damages either would constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of the Company
for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, the remaining balance
of the liquidated damages. Any amount of liquidated damages that remains
unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible
during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitation of
this paragraph, provided that no such payment need be made after the
fifth anniversary of the date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Company shall cease to qualify as a real estate investment trust for
federal income tax purposes, the entire unpaid balance of the liquidated
damages shall be payable immediately.

LAWS.   

SECTION 9.6. _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and except as set forth
in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended

binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.   

SECTION 9.9. _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement,
unless a contrary intention appears, (a) the words "herein," "hereof" and
"hereunder" and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision, (b) the
words "include," "includes," "including" or other similar terms are deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation" and are intended by the parties
to be by way of example rather than limitation, (c) reference to any Article
or Section means such Article or Section of this Agreement, (d) all terms
defined in this Agreement have their defined meanings when used in
any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto, unless
otherwise defined therein, (e) the definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms, (f)
if any action is to be taken by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement
on a day that is not a business day, such action shall be taken on the next
business day following such day, (g) the use of "or" is not intended to be

business" (or similar terms) shall be deemed followed by "consistent with
past practice," (i) "assets" shall include "rights," including rights
under contracts and (j) "reasonable efforts" or similar terms shall not
require the waiver of any rights under this Agreement. As used in this

or required by law or executive order to be closed for the conduct of regular
banking business, and except where the context otherwise requires, " _person_
" means any individual, partnership, joint venture, corporation, limited
liability company, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity and a
government or any department, agency or subdivision thereof, including the
permitted successors and assigns of such person. No provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted or construed against any party solely because
that party or its legal representative drafted the provision.   

SECTION 9.10. _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Company, Parent and Subsidiary
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and agrees to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland and of the
United States of America located in the State of Maryland (the " _Maryland
Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees
not to plead or claim in any Maryland Court that such litigation brought
therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 9.10 is intended to waive the right of any party
to remove any such action or proceeding commenced in any such state court to
an appropriate federal court that is a Maryland Court to the extent the basis
for such removal exists under applicable law.   

SECTION 9.11. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that (i) any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the Company in accordance with their specific terms and (ii)
that the provisions of the last sentence of Section 6.5(a) were not performed
by Parent or Subsidiary in accordance with its specific terms. It
is accordingly agreed that Parent and Subsidiary shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which Parent and Subsidiary are entitled at law or in equity. The
Company shall only be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any
breach by Parent or Subsidiary of the last sentence of Section 6.5(a).   

SECTION 9.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.   

SECTION 9.13. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement. No representations, warranty, promise, inducement or
statement of intention has been made by any party that is not embodied in
this Agreement or such other documents, and none of the parties shall be
bound by, or be liable for, any alleged representation, warranty, promise,
inducement or statement of intention not embodied herein or therein.
