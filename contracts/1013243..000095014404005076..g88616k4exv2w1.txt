conveyance or delivery to Buyer of any asset that would be a Purchased Asset
is (a) prohibited by any applicable Law or (b) would require any

intellectual property of any Third Party or has constituted or does or will
constitute unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of any
jurisdiction; (viii) there are no Actions or Proceedings relating to
any Transferred Intellectual Property or the Reformulation Intellectual
Property, nor to the Knowledge of Seller has any such Action or Proceeding

is subject to any outstanding decree, order, judgment, agreement or
stipulation restricting in any manner   -21-   the use, transfer or
licensing thereof or that may affect the validity, use or enforceability of

Property; (ix) no present or former employee or consultant of Sellers owns or
has any proprietary financial or other interest, direct or indirect, in the

Intellectual Property is freely transferable and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not place Sellers in

Intellectual Property or the Reformulation Intellectual Property, or effect
any license under or Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances) on

Intellectual Property, constitutes all of the Intellectual Property rights
owned or controlled by Seller or any of its Affiliates that are necessary for
the conduct of the Business as conducted as of the Closing Date or are
otherwise necessary for the conduct of the Business as conducted as of
the Closing Date.   (e) Sellers have taken reasonable measures to protect

which have not, to Sellers\' Knowledge, been breached. All of the current and
prior employees employed in the Business have executed valid intellectual
property and confidentiality agreements for the benefit of Sellers. To

Seller in their reasonable discretion. Seller promptly shall notify Buyer in
the event that a recall, Product withdrawal or field alert of any units of
Product manufactured and released by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates
is necessary. Buyer shall consult with Sellers with respect to the necessity
and procedures for any recall, Product withdrawal or field alert for which
Sellers will have financial responsibility.   Section 8.15 Chargebacks,
Returns and Rebates. (a) With respect to wholesaler chargebacks and any
associated administrative or service fees related to sales   -34-   of
Products sold by or on behalf of Sellers and their Affiliates or sold by
or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates ("Vendor Chargebacks"), Sellers shall
be financially responsible for (x) all Vendor Chargebacks occurring prior to
the Closing Date and (y) all Vendor Chargebacks relating to Products sold by
or on behalf of Sellers and their Affiliates regardless of whether they occur
prior to, on or following the Closing Date. Buyer shall be financially
responsible for all other Vendor Chargebacks occurring after the Closing
Date. A Party shall invoice the other Party on a monthly basis for any Vendor
Chargebacks for which the other Party bears responsibility and as to which
invoicing Party issues a credit or otherwise makes payment, which invoice
shall include detail of such Vendor Chargebacks on an itemized basis, and the
other Party shall pay all such invoices within thirty (30) days after the
other Party\'s receipt thereof. For purposes of this Section 8.15(a), Vendor
Chargebacks shall be deemed to have "occurred" on the date that the
applicable wholesaler ships the related Product to its customer. For the
purposes of administering this Section 8.15(a), Vendor Chargebacks shall be
apportioned between Buyer and Sellers on a "first in, first out" basis, with
Vendor Chargebacks (and returns that Sellers are responsible for from the
Pipeline Inventory that can be determined to originate from a wholesaler)
applied against or in respect of Pipeline Inventory until Vendor Chargebacks
exceed Pipeline Inventory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if chargebacks
exceed the sum of Pipeline Inventory and Buyer\'s sales of Products, the
excess chargebacks shall be attributed to Seller. Any amounts owed by a Party
pursuant to this Section 8.15(a) which are not paid when due shall
bear interest at 1.5% per month.   (b) Buyer will be responsible for all
returns of Products sold on or after the Closing, and Seller will be
responsible for returns of Products sold before the Closing. The
responsibility for returns shall include, without limitation, issuing an
appropriate credit or making an appropriate reimbursement to the returning
third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Buyer receives
Product from lots that include Product that was sold by Seller or
its Affiliates prior to the Closing (each a "Partial Lot"), Seller shall
be responsible for all returns of Product included in such Partial Lot
(regardless of who sold such Product). Each Party shall destroy Product
returned to it in accordance with Applicable Laws regardless of whether it
had the responsibility for the returned Product pursuant to this Section
8.14(a). A Party may invoice the other Party for the actual expenses incurred
as a result of destroying Product for which the other Party is responsible,
including without limitation, fees paid to third persons for receiving and
processing such returned Product. Such other Party will pay such invoice
within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice. No Party shall issue a credit
to a Third Party or reimburse a third person attributable to returns for
which the other Party is responsible. Party is responsible, including without
limitation, fees paid to third persons for receiving the processing such
returned Product. Such other Party will pay such invoice within thirty (30)
days of the date of invoice. Each Party shall assist with processing
chargebacks and returns where documentation is required to reconcile and
resolve issues with Third Parties.   (c) Seller will process and be
responsible for the administration and payment of all federal, state, local
and private managed care programs, including   -35-   Medicaid/Medicare
rebates (collectively, "Rebate Programs"), in each case, related to Products
sold under Seller\'s NDC code, regardless of whether such Product was sold by
Seller or Buyer; provided, however, that Seller will invoice Buyer with
sufficient detail to adequately support the charges in the invoice related to
payments associated with rebate programs or Products sold by Buyer after
Closing.   (d) Sellers shall process and be responsible for
the administration and payment of the quarterly Premier and CHHPS market
share rebate programs that relate to calendar quarters prior to the Closing,
the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs, and the first calendar
quarter after the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs. Buyer shall
be responsible for the administration and payment of all other quarterly
rebates with respect to such programs after the Closing. Sellers will not be
responsible for any increases in such rebate amounts as a result of the
changes made by Buyer to such rebate programs.   (e) Buyer acknowledges
that Seller will require certain information from Buyer in order to calculate
the Medicaid rebate for Products bearing Seller\'s NDC number. Accordingly,
Buyer agrees that, from and after the Closing Date until the date which is
one calendar year after the expiration date of the last lot of Products
produced with Sellers\' NDC number, Buyer will provide to Seller,
concurrently with its timely delivery of related information to the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (or any successor agency), the following
information: (a) the "best price" (as defined under the Social Security Act,
42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-8(c)(1)(C)) for each Product identified by NDC
number, (b) the "average manufacturer price" (as defined under the
Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 1396r-8(k)(1)) for each Product
identified by NDC number, and (c) any additional data or other information
related to such Medicaid issues reasonably requested by Seller.   (f) The
Parties acknowledge that the VA National Acquisition Center must approve the
removal of the Products from Seller\'s Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS") before
the responsibility of processing such chargebacks is transferred from Seller
to Buyer. Accordingly, in the event such approval is not obtained prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall continue to be responsible for processing the
FSS chargebacks on Buyer\'s behalf, and Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for the
actual chargebacks paid.   (g) Seller shall be financially responsible for
all rebates, wholesaler administration fees and group purchasing organization
management fees associated with, and all other forms of discounts granted by
Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to, and any claims for
overcharges relating to, any Products manufactured or released by or on
behalf of by Seller and its Affiliates, including, without limitation,
rebates owed to state Medicaid programs and patient assistance or indigent
programs.   (h) In the event that Buyer increases the published
Wholesaler Acquisition Cost ("WAC") of any of the Products, Buyer shall (i)
promptly notify Sellers of such increase and (ii) reimburse Sellers, promptly
following Buyers\' receipt of Sellers\'   -36-   demand therefor, the
increase in amounts associated with returns, rebates or chargebacks for which
Sellers are responsible as a result of such increase in WAC.   Section 8.16
Further Assurances. (a) On and after the Closing, Seller shall from time to
time, at the request of Buyer, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, such other instruments of conveyance and transfer and take
such other actions as Buyer may reasonably request in order to more
effectively vest in Buyer good and marketable title to the Purchased
Assets (including assistance in the collection or reduction to possession of
any of the Purchased Assets) and more effectively confirm Sellers\' retention
of the Excluded Liabilities.   (b) On and after the Closing, Buyer shall
from time to time, at the request of Seller, take such actions as Seller may
reasonably request in order to more effectively confirm Buyer\'s assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities.   Section 8.17 Guaranty. Buyer shall cause Mayne

of the date of delivery with respect to all such M.V.I Adult in the unit vial
presentation and the first anniversary of delivery with respect to all other
presentations of the M.V.I Adult is less than (B) the product of
three, multiplied by Seller Monthly Volume for such presentation, multiplied
by (ii) Buyer\'s cost of goods sold per unit for such presentation.   (c)
Within 45 days following the Closing, Sellers shall furnish to Buyer
inventory reports and sales data obtained from each wholesaler
specifying, with respect to each wholesaler to which Sellers have sold any
presentation of any Product, and with respect to each such presentation, the
on-hand and in-transit inventory of such presentation (identifying units by
list number) held by such wholesaler as of the Closing Date (the number of
units of such presentation so held by such wholesaler, the "Pipeline  
-37-   Inventory"). Within 60 days following the Closing, Sellers shall pay
to Buyer, with respect to each presentation of any Product held by such
wholesaler, an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of

Matters. (a) Sellers shall conduct or cause to be conducted a reasonable
investigation concerning the out of specification aluminum levels in the unit
vial presentation of M.V.I.-12 and/or M.V.I. Adult (to the extent applicable)

that Sellers may not seek payment from Buyer to the extent that Buyer
recovers reimbursements from Third Parties as a result of the circumstances
to which such payments relate, and Buyer shall diligently seek to secure such
reimbursements prior to making any claim pursuant to this Section 8.19(b) if
Buyer has reasonable grounds to believe that any such Third Party is
obligated to make such reimbursements, provided that Sellers shall bear
Buyer\'s reasonable costs in seeking such reimbursements; and (ii) Buyers
shall not be obligated to seek such reimbursements from Third Parties
following the first anniversary of the Closing. Notwithstanding the

Buyer of such discovery. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of Sellers\'
notice, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the difference between what was paid and

recruiting efforts not directed specifically at the Sales Employees or any
particular Sales Employee(s). For the period commencing from the date hereof
and expiring on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that
it and its Affiliates will not directly or indirectly induce, encourage or

made available by Buyer for the benefit of Applicable Employees and their

Indemnifying Party elects to assume and control  such defense, it shall be
conclusively established that the  Indemnifying Party is obligated (subject
to the other provisions of  this Article XI) to indemnify and reimburse the
Indemnified Party in  respect of the matters described in the Indemnification
Claim  Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the   -45-   
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there is a  reasonable
probability that the Third Party Claim may materially and  adversely affect
it or its Affiliates other than as a result of  monetary damages for which
the Indemnified Party would be entitled  to indemnification or reimbursement
under this Article XI, or (ii)  the actual or potential defendants in, or
targets of, such Third  Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified  Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded  that there may be legal defenses available to it which are
different  from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, 
then, in either such case, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the  right
to assume or control such defense.   (ii) After the Indemnifying Party duly
assumes the defense of  such Third Party Claim:   (A) The Indemnified Party
shall have the right to, but  shall not be obligated to, employ separate
counsel and to  participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim. The 
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for  the reasonable
fees and disbursements of such separate counsel  as incurred, if: (I) the
actual or potential defendants in, or  targets of, such Third Party Claim
include both the  Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the 
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there  may be legal
defenses available to it which are different from  or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party,  (II) the Indemnifying Party shall not
have employed counsel  reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to
represent  the Indemnified Party within a reasonable time after electing  to
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim or fails to  diligently pursue
the defense of such Third Party Claim, or  (III) the Indemnifying Party shall
authorize the Indemnified  Party to employ separate counsel at the
Indemnifying Party\'s  expense.   (B) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate
in all  reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party in connection  with
such defense and all costs and expenses incurred by the  Indemnified Party in
connection therewith shall be a liability  of, and shall be paid by, the
Indemnifying Party as incurred.   (C) The Indemnifying Party shall not
settle,  compromise, admit liability or consent to the entry of  judgment in
connection with such Third Party Claim, nor shall  it offer to do so, in any
such case without the Indemnified  Party\'s written consent, unless (I) no
finding or admission of  any violation of Law or any   -46-    violation
of the rights of any Person can be made as the  result of such action and
such action will have no effect on  other claims that have been made or are
reasonably likely to  be made against the Indemnified Party, and (II) the
sole  relief (if any) provided is monetary damages that are  reimbursed in
full by the Indemnifying Party.   (D) The Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability  with respect to any compromise, settlement or discharge of the 
Third Party Claim effected without its written consent (which  consent may
not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or  conditioned), unless the
Indemnifying Party, after taking  control of the defense, fails to continue
to diligently pursue  the defense of such claim.   (iii) If the
Indemnifying Party has not provided written  notice to the Indemnified Party
of its election to assume and  control the defense of such Third Party Claim
within 10 days  following its receipt of the Indemnification Claim Notice,
then (A)  the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any action taken, or any 
compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party prior to  the
assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Party, and (B) to  the extent
that such Third Party Claim is subject to indemnification  or reimbursement
with respect to the Third Party Claim (which it  shall be conclusively
subject to reimbursement if the Indemnifying  Party later takes control of
the defense), all costs and expenses  incurred by the Indemnified Party in
defending the Third Party Claim  (including but not limited to legal,
accounting and other  professional fees and disbursements, removal costs,
remediation  costs, closure costs and expenses of investigation,
preparation,  defense and ongoing monitoring) shall be a liability of, and
shall  be paid by, the Indemnifying Party as incurred. If the Indemnifying 
Party has not provided such notice within 60 days following its  receipt of
the Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party  shall thereafter
have no right to assume or control such defense.   (e) The Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall keep each other fully informed concerning
the status of such Third Party Claim and any related proceedings at all
stages thereof, and shall render to each other such assistance as they may
reasonably require of each other and shall cooperate with each other in good
faith in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of such Third Party
Claim.   (f) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to avoid production of
confidential information (consistent with applicable Law and rules of
procedure), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
other representatives of the Indemnified Party and the  
-47-   Indemnifying Party to be made so as to preserve any applicable
attorney-client or work-product privileges.   (g) Each Party hereby
consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Third
Party Claim is brought for purposes of any claim for indemnification or
reimbursement with respect to such Third Party Claim or the matters alleged
therein, and agrees that process may be served on such Party with respect to
any such claim anywhere in the world.   Section 11.03 Limitations. (a) The
amount of any Losses under Section 11.02(a) or Section 11.02(b), as the case
may be, shall be reduced by the net amount of any insurance proceeds actually
paid to the Indemnified Party as a result of the matters underlying such
claim, after upward adjustment for any premium increases attributable to the
matters underlying such claim. The reduction specified in this Section
11.03(a) shall not be applied to the extent insurance proceeds are paid by
the Indemnified Party\'s self-insurance program.   (b) To the extent
permitted by Law, any payment made by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article XI shall be treated on the Parties\' Tax returns as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. The portion of any such payment that
is reasonably attributable to a particular Purchased Asset shall be deemed to
be an adjustment to the consideration allocated to such Purchased Asset. The
portion of any such payment that is not reasonably attributable to a
particular Purchased Asset shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the
consideration allocated to all Purchased Assets, with such adjustment
calculated on a pro rata basis. The rights to indemnification
and reimbursement under this Article XI shall not be subject to set-off for
any claim by any Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified Party, whether or
not arising from the same event giving rise to such Indemnified Party\'s
claim.   (c) In the event a claim for indemnification or
reimbursement under this Article XI shall have been finally determined, the
amount of the related Losses shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party on or before the thirtieth (30th) day after such final
determination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Any claim,
the Indemnifying Party\'s liability therefor and the amount of the related
Losses shall be "finally determined" when the parties to such claim have so
determined by mutual written agreement or, if disputed, when a final and non-
appealable Order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall have been entered
concerning such matters. Such Losses paid later than thirty (30) days after
being finally determined will accrue interest at a rate equal to the lesser
of 1.5% per month and the maximum interest rate allowed by applicable
Laws.   (d) In no event shall Sellers be liable for any Losses pursuant
to Section 11.02(a)(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
Losses exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case Sellers
shall, subject to the next sentence, be liable for all such Losses in excess
of the Threshold Amount. The   -48-   cumulative aggregate amount of
Losses for which Sellers shall be liable pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(ii)
shall be one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) if the Remaining Purchase
Price is not paid and one hundred five million dollars ($105,000,000) if the
Remaining Purchase Price is paid.   (e) No Party shall be liable for
consequential damages other than lost profits. Sellers shall not be liable
for lost profits other than pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(ii) and the
cumulative aggregate amount of lost profits for which Sellers shall be liable
pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(ii) shall be twenty five million dollars
($25,000,000). Buyer shall not be liable for lost profits other than pursuant
to Section 11.02(b)(ii) and the cumulative aggregate amount of lost profits
for which Buyer shall be liable pursuant to Section 11.02(b)(ii) shall be
twenty five million dollars ($25,000,000). No Party shall be liable pursuant
to this Article XI for any treble or punitive damages, or for any speculative
damages, except, in any such case, for those awarded by a court of competent
jurisdiction in connection with a Third Party Claim asserted against an
Indemnified Party.   (f) The provisions of this Article XI shall constitute
the Parties\' sole remedies for breach of representation,
misrepresentation, negligent representation and all similar causes of action
accruing on or after the Closing, other than actual fraud, arising in
connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.   ARTICLE XII   TERMINATION
AND ABANDONMENT   Section 12.01 Methods of Termination. The transactions
contemplated herein may be terminated and/or abandoned at any time prior to
the Closing:   (a) by mutual written agreement of Sellers and Buyer; or  
(b) by either Sellers or Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred by May
31, 2004; provided that the terminating Party is not in material breach of
its obligations hereunder;   (c) by either Sellers or Buyer if the other
Party becomes insolvent or seeks protection under any bankruptcy,
receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable
proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against the other Party
which proceeding remains undismissed for a period of 30 days;   (d) by
either Sellers or Buyer if there shall be in effect any Law that prohibits
the Closing or if the Closing would violate any non-appealable Order; or  
-49-    (e) by either Sellers or Buyer if the other Party has breached
any material obligation hereunder that remains uncured for a period of 30
days after written notice and demand for cure thereof by the non-breaching
Party.   Section 12.02 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event
of termination and abandonment under Section 12.01 hereof, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated and abandoned, without
further action by the Parties hereto, subject, however, to any applicable
cure periods. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
terminated and/or abandoned as provided herein:   (a) Each Party, if
requested in writing, will redeliver or destroy all documents, work papers
and other material of the other Party and its Affiliates relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the same;   (b) All confidential
information received by any Party hereto with respect to the business of any
other party or its Affiliates shall be treated in accordance with that
certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 26, 2003, by and
between AAI and Mayne Group Limited (the "Confidentiality Agreement").  
(c) No Party hereto and none of their respective directors, officers,
stockholders, Affiliates or controlling Persons shall have any
further liability or obligation to any other Party to this Agreement except
as stated in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Section, except that (i)
nothing in this Section 12.02 shall prejudice any rights, claims, or causes
of action that may have accrued hereunder or with respect hereto prior to the
date of such termination including with respect to a Party\'s breach of this
Agreement prior to the termination or abandonment of this Agreement and (ii)
the provisions of Article XII and Article XIII shall survive any termination
of this Agreement.   ARTICLE XIII   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 13.01
Confidentiality. The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby incorporated herein
by reference and shall continue in full force and effect except that (i) as
of the Closing, Buyer is released from its obligations thereunder (other than
the obligations set forth in Sections 8, 9 and 13 thereof) to the extent that
they pertain to the Product, the Business and the Purchased Assets, and (ii)
all information pertaining to the Product, the Business and the Purchased
Assets will be deemed to be Confidential Information of Buyer as of the
Closing Date and Sellers shall have the obligations of confidentiality, non-
disclosure and non-use set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement with
respect thereto for the entire duration of the statute of limitations
applicable to this Agreement; provided, however, that (x) the Purpose defined
therein will be deemed to also include the exchange or observation of
Confidential Information related to this   -50-   Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions described herein, (y) Buyer shall have the
same rights and obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement as Mayne
Group Limited, and (z) AAI Properties and aaiPharma LLC shall have the same
rights and obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement as AAI. Prior
to the Closing, Sellers and Buyers shall consult with each other and
negotiate in good faith concerning any modifications of or amendments to this
Section 13.01 reasonably necessary in view of the purposes of this Section
13.01 and the purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.   Section 13.02

matter hereof and contains the sole and entire agreement among the Parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.   Section 13.04 Waiver.
Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the
Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be
effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any Party
hereto of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.
All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded,
will be cumulative and not alternative.   -52-    Section 13.05
Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only by a
written instrument duly executed by each Party hereto.   Section 13.06 Third
Party Beneficiaries. The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended
solely for the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors
or permitted assigns and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer
third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person, other than the
Indemnified Parties, who are intended Third Party beneficiaries of Article XI
of this Agreement.   Section 13.07 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this
Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by
any Party hereto without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto,
and any attempt to do so, other than as permitted above, will be void. This
Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  
Section 13.08 Headings. The headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit
the provisions hereof.   Section 13.09 Severability. It is the intention of
the Parties that if any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights
or obligations of any Party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never compromised a part
hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar to terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible and reasonably acceptable to the Parties
herein.   Section 13.10 Specific Performance. The Parties hereto
each acknowledge that, in view of the uniqueness of the subject matter
hereof, the Parties would not have an adequate remedy at law for money
damages if this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms,
and therefore agree that the Parties hereto shall be entitled to specific
enforcement of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy to which the
parties may be entitled at law or in equity.   Section 13.11 Governing Law.
