the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof,
if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall occur instead
on 0 the earlier to occur of (i) any Business Day during the Marketing Period
that is the last Business Day of a month to be specified by the Acquiror to
the Parent on no less than three Business Days written notice to the Parent
and (ii) the first Business Day following the last day of the Marketing Period
that is the last Business Day of a month or (b) such other date, time or place

satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but

on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 2.03. _Purchase Price_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at Closing, the Acquiror shall:

 



 

(a) pay to the Parent, an aggregate amount in cash equal to $2.1975 billion
plus the Additional Cash Consideration (if any), which amount shall be
adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to _Section 2.04(f)_ (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ");

 



 

(b) issue and deliver to the Parent a number of shares of its convertible non-
voting common-equivalent preference shares having the designation and the
voting and other powers, preferences, participating, option or other rights,
and subject to the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as
substantially set forth in the Acquiror Convertible Preferred Stock
Certificate of Designations attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (" _Acquiror
Convertible Preferred Stock_ ") determined pursuant to _Section 2.04_ (the "
_Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration_ "); and

 



 

(c) if prior to the Closing, the Acquiror issues to the public shares of its
cumulative perpetual preference shares having the designation and the voting
and other powers, preferences, participating, option or other rights, and
subject to the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as substantially
set forth in _Exhibit D_ (" _Acquiror Perpetual Preferred Stock_ ") with an
aggregate liquidation preference of at least $450.0 million (a " _Qualifying
Preferred Stock Issuance_ " and such amount, the " _Preferred Stock Issuance
Amount"_ ), issue and deliver to the Parent shares of Acquiror Perpetual
Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the lesser
of (A) $250.0 million and (B) (x) $700.0 million _less_ (y) the Company
Dividend Amount, _and then less_ (z) the Preferred Stock Issuance Amount, or,
if such calculation results in a negative number, $0 (such shares, if any, the
" _Perpetual Preferred Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the
Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration and the shares of Acquiror Common
Stock underlying the Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Underlying Shares_ "), the " _Stock Consideration_ "); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the (a) sum
of (i) the Company Dividend Amount and (ii) the Perpetual Preferred Stock
Consideration shall not exceed $250.0 million. For the avoidance of doubt, if
there is no Qualifying Preferred Stock Issuance, no Perpetual Preferred Stock
Consideration will be issued.

 



 

(d) " _Company Dividend Amount_ " means the aggregate amount of any dividends
paid and distributions made by the Company to the Parent between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing as permitted in accordance with _Section
5.01(i)_.

 



 

(e) " _Additional Cash Consideration_ " means an amount (which may be zero,
but never less than zero) equal to $250.0 million _less_ the Company Dividend
Amount (if any) _less_ the Perpetual Preferred Stock Consideration (if any).
As an example, if the Preferred Stock Issuance Amount was $600.0 million and
the Company Dividend Amount was $50.0 million, the Perpetual Preferred Stock
Consideration would be $50.0 million and the Additional Cash Consideration
would be $150.0 million.

 



 

(f) As used in this Agreement, the " _Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Cash
Consideration together with the Stock Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.04. _Adjustment to the Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration at
Closing_.

 



 

(a) If the Average Stock Price per common share, par value $0.0033 per share,
of the Acquiror (" _Acquiror Common Stock_ ") is at least equal to the Low
Reference Stock Price and no greater than $76.3938 per share, the Convertible
Preferred Stock Consideration shall be a number of shares of Acquiror
Convertible Preferred Stock that initially converts into a number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock equal to $975.0 million divided by the Average Stock
Price (rounded up to the nearest whole share). The Average Stock Price shall
equal the volume weighted average closing trading price per share on the
NASDAQ, as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ (or such other source as the
parties hereto shall agree in writing) (the " _VWAP_ "), during the period of
15 days for which the NASDAQ is open for trading (each such day, a " _Trading
Day_ ") ending on, and including, the fifth Trading Day prior to the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Average Stock Price_ "); _provided_ that, if the Acquiror
issues Acquiror Common Stock as permitted in accordance with _Section
5.02(v)_ and the closing of such issuance occurs on or after the 19th Trading
Day prior to the Closing Date, then the Average Stock Price shall be the
lesser of (i) the Closing Average Stock Price and (ii) the VWAP during the
period commencing on the first Trading Day following the public announcement
of the final pricing of such issuance and ending on, and including, the fifth
Trading Day prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
period would be shorter than 10 Trading Days, then the period shall be
extended to include such number of additional consecutive Trading Days as
necessary to make the period at least 10 Trading Days, although not later than
the second Trading Day prior to the Closing Date even if such period is then
less than 10 Trading Days.

 



 

(b) The Low Reference Stock Price shall equal the lesser of (x) $71.0640 (the
" _Reference Stock Price_ ") _multiplied_ by ninety-two and a half (92.5)
percent (which for the avoidance of doubt, equals $65.7342) and (y) if between
the date hereof and the Closing, the

 



      
 

 



 

Acquiror issues Acquiror Common Stock as permitted in accordance with _Section
5.02(v)_, ninety-two and a half (92.5) percent _multiplied_ by the quotient of
(A) the sum of the aggregate value of such Acquiror Common Stock issued by the
Acquiror in accordance with _Section 5.02(v)_ _ plus_ the product of (1) the
Reference Stock Price _multiplied by_ (2) the number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock issued and outstanding on the date hereof _divided_ by (B) the

(c) If the Average Stock Price is greater than $76.3938 per share, the
Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration shall be a number of shares of
Acquiror Convertible Preferred Stock that initially converts into a number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to $975.0 million divided by $76.3938
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole share).

Stock (together with any other shares of Capital Stock to be issued under any
other transaction that the NASDAQ requires the Acquiror to aggregate with the
Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration for purposes of shareholder approval
requirements) that would require shareholder approval of the issuance of the
Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration or the Underlying Shares, then the
Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration will be capped at the maximum number
of shares that can be issued without Acquiror shareholder approval, and the
Parent agrees to accept and the Acquiror agrees to pay, in lieu of the balance
of the Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration, cash consideration with a
value equal to the number of Underlying Shares that the Parent would be
foregoing because of this restriction multiplied by the price per share of

retaliation), wages and hours, and occupational safety and health, and the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and any other comparable

accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant

satisfies the requisite risk transfer criteria necessary to obtain reinsurance
accounting treatment under SAP.

Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the Governmental Deposits are being held in compliance with applicable

property and interests in real property owned in fee by the Company or any of

Assets if beneficially owned by any of the Insurance Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2015 (each, an " _Owned Real Property_ "). The Company or a
Transferred Subsidiary (as the case may be) has good and marketable fee simple
title to all Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Liens of any nature
except for Permitted Liens. Except as set forth on _Section 3.20(a)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Transferred Subsidiary
has leased or otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or occupy such
Owned Real Property or any portion thereof and there are no unrecorded
outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal or
similar rights to purchase or lease such Owned Real Property or any portion
thereof or interest therein. Each Owned Real Property is in good working order
and repair, except for any defects which would not materially impair the use

leasehold interest under each of the Real Property Leases, subject to
Permitted Liens and to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, rehabilitation, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance, preferential
transfer or similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect relating to or affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
the effect of general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law), and, as of the date hereof,
none of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries has received any written
notice of any default under any Real Property Lease, and, to the Knowledge of
the Parent, no event has occurred and no condition exists that, with notice or

Transferred Subsidiaries under any of the Real Property Leases. Except as set
forth on _Section 3.20(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any Transferred Subsidiary has leased or otherwise granted to any
Person the right to use or occupy such Leased Real Property or any portion

any statute of limitations in respect of U.S. federal Income Taxes or other
material Taxes

 



      
 

 



 

which waiver is currently in effect other than (i) as a result of the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries being members of any Non-Transferred Group or
(ii) with respect to non-income Taxes, in the Ordinary Course of Business, as
applicable.

 



 

(d) The Company and each of the Transferred Subsidiaries have complied in all

(e) All material deficiencies asserted in writing or material assessments made
in writing as a result of any examinations by any Tax Authority of Tax Returns
of the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries have been fully paid,
and no other material audits or material investigations by any Tax Authority
relating to any Tax Returns of the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries are in progress with respect to which the Company or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries has received written notice from a Tax Authority
other than as a result of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries being
members of any Non-Transferred Group.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor any Transferred Subsidiary is a party to any Tax
allocation, Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or similar agreement pursuant to which
it will have any obligation to make any payments after the Closing Date to any
person other than the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary. For purposes of
this representation, an agreement described in the previous sentence does not
include any Contract entered into by the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary
in the Ordinary Course of Business that does not primarily relate to Taxes,
but such an agreement shall include any Contract relating to the acquisition
or disposition (including by way of spin-off or split-off) of entities or
substantially all of the assets of an entity that includes an obligation to
make payments in respect of Tax.

 



 

(g) There are no Tax rulings, requests for rulings or closing agreements in

Subsidiary which will materially affect the Companys or any Transferred
Subsidiarys liability for Taxes for any period after the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any Transferred Subsidiary is required to make any
adjustment pursuant to Section 481(c) of the Code for any Post-Closing Taxable
Period as a result of a change in accounting method.

 



 

(i) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any assets of the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary other than liens in respect of current ad valorem
property Taxes not yet due and payable.

 



 

(j) No claim has been made in writing by any Tax Authority in a jurisdiction
in which the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries does not pay Tax
or file a Tax Return that the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries
is or may be subject to Tax by that jurisdiction.

insurance regulatory authority, in any case, since December 31, 2012 and prior
to the date hereof and (b) a list of all material Holding Company System Act
filings or submissions made by any Insurance Subsidiary with any insurance
regulatory authority since December 31, 2012 and prior to the date hereof. All

satisfaction of the Governmental Authority that noted such deficiencies or

The Parent has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment, and the Parent is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment, including a complete loss of its investment. The Parent
understands and agrees that it may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or
otherwise dispose of any shares of Acquiror Common Stock, Acquiror Convertible

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ACQUIROR**

 



 

Except as set forth (i) in the any reports, filings, notices or statements
publicly filed by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with the SEC prior to
the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any risk factors (other
than any historical factual information set forth therein), any forward-
looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or any other section
to the extent they are forward looking statements or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), (ii) the financial statements of the Acquiror
included in the Acquiror SEC Documents (the " _Acquiror Financial Statements_
") or (iii) the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure
schedule delivered to the Parent by the Acquiror prior to entering into this
Agreement (the " _Acquiror Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being understood and
agreed by the parties hereto that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section or subsection of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule
to the extent that the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its
face to be applicable to such other section or subsection), the Acquiror
hereby represents and warrants to the Parent as of the date hereof and (unless
otherwise stated in this _Article IV_) as of the Closing Date as follows:

 



 

Section 4.01. _Incorporation and Authority of the Acquiror_. The Acquiror is
an exempted company with limited liability duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of Bermuda. The Acquiror or the applicable
Affiliate of the Acquiror (as applicable) has all requisite corporate or other
applicable organizational power to enter into, consummate the transactions
contemplated by and carry out its obligations under, each of the Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party. The execution and delivery by the Acquiror
or the applicable Affiliate of the Acquiror (as applicable) of each of the
Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation by the
Acquiror or the applicable Affiliate of the

 



      
 

 



 

Acquiror (as applicable) of the transactions contemplated by each of the
Transaction Agreements to which it is a party have been or will be prior to
the Closing (as applicable) duly authorized by all requisite corporate or
other similar organizational action on the part of the Acquiror or the
applicable Affiliate of the Acquiror (as applicable). Each of the Transaction
Agreements to which the Acquiror or the applicable Affiliate of the Acquiror
(as applicable) is a party has been, or upon execution and delivery thereof
will be, duly executed and delivered by the Acquiror or the applicable
Affiliate of the Acquiror (as applicable). Assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties hereto or thereto, each of the
Transaction Agreements to which the Acquiror or the applicable Affiliate of
the Acquiror (as applicable) is a party constitutes, or upon execution and
delivery thereof will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Acquiror or the applicable Affiliate of the Acquiror (as applicable),
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject in each case to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, rehabilitation, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance, preferential
transfer or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
the effect of general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

Section 4.02. _Incorporation, Qualification and Authority of the Significant
Subsidiaries of the Acquiror_. Each of the Significant Subsidiaries of the
Acquiror is a corporation or other organization duly incorporated or
organized, validly existing and in good standing (or the equivalent, if any,
in the applicable jurisdiction) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization and has the requisite corporate or other
applicable organizational power and authority to conduct its business as
presently conducted, except where the failures to be so incorporated or
organized, existing or in good standing (or the equivalent, if any, in the
applicable jurisdiction) or to have such power or authority, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Significant Subsidiaries of the Acquiror
is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other organization to do
business, and is in good standing (or the equivalent, if any, in the
applicable jurisdiction), in each jurisdiction where the character of its
owned, operated or leased assets or properties or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification and good standing (or the equivalent, if any, in the
applicable jurisdiction) necessary, except for failures to so qualify or be in
good standing that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.03. _Capital Structure of the Acquiror and its Significant
Subsidiaries; Ownership and Transfer of the Stock Consideration_.

 



 

(a) As of August 12, 2016 and, subject to _Section 5.02(v)_, the Closing

class or series of Capital Stock in the Acquiror and each of the Significant
Subsidiaries of the Acquiror have been authorized and validly issued, are
fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any
preemptive or subscription rights enforceable under applicable Law. The

its obligations under this Agreement and (y) Acquiror Common Stock for
issuance of the Underlying Shares upon transfer and conversion of all or any
portion of the Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration at any time by the

limitation on such transfer or conversion. The Stock Consideration (including,
for avoidance of doubt, the Underlying Shares) has been duly authorized and
reserved for issuance hereunder and when issued to the Parent in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free and clear of all Liens, other than any Liens arising as
a result of any of the Transaction Agreements or restrictions on transfer
imposed by applicable Laws or the Transaction Agreements, will not have been
issued in violation of any preemptive or subscription rights enforceable under
applicable Law, and will be issued in compliance with all applicable federal
and state securities Laws. As of the Closing Date, the shares of the Acquiror
Convertible Preferred Stock will have the designation and the voting and other

qualifications, limitations and restrictions as substantially set forth in the
form of the Acquiror Convertible Preferred Stock Certificate of Designations,
and the shares of the Acquiror Perpetual Preferred Stock, if any, will have
the designation and the voting and other powers, preferences, participating,

exchangeable securities, or conversion, preemptive, subscription or other
rights, or Contracts, in any such case, obligating or which may obligate the
Acquiror to issue, sell, purchase, return or redeem, or otherwise dispose of,
transfer, or acquire, any shares (or other applicable interests or units) of
its Capital Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for any
shares (or other applicable interests or units) of its Capital Stock, in each
case, with or without payment of additional consideration in cash or property,
either immediately or upon the occurrence of a specified date or a specified
event or the satisfaction or happening of any other condition or contingency
(collectively, with respect to any Persons shares) (or other applicable units
or interests). Other than the Stock Consideration and shares reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of options or other equity awards pursuant to
employee or director stock plans of the Acquiror, there are no shares (or
other applicable interests or units) of any Capital Stock of the Acquiror
reserved for issuance. There are no capital appreciation rights, phantom stock
plans, securities with participation rights or features or similar obligations
and commitments of the Acquiror. No Person has any right to cause the Acquiror
to effect the registration under the Securities Act of any securities of the
Acquiror or any securities of its Subsidiaries other than those securities
which are currently registered on an effective registration statement on file
with the SEC.

 



 

(b) As of the Closing Date, except for this Agreement, the Investor Rights

by the Acquiror of the Stock Consideration, do not and will not, directly or
indirectly (with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both)

the applicable Affiliate of the Acquiror (as applicable), (b) conflict with or

constitute a default (or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default) under, require any consent under or
give to any Person any rights of termination, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in a loss of material rights under, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the businesses, assets or
properties of the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates pursuant to, any material
contract or any note, bond, loan or credit agreement, mortgage or indenture to
which the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates is a party or by which any of them
or any of their respective properties or assets is bound or subject, except,
in the case of clause (c) of this _Section 4.04_, for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations, cancellations,
losses of rights or creations that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

party, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the issuance and delivery by the
Acquiror of the Stock Consideration, will not, require (i) any approval by the
shareholders of the Acquiror to be obtained or (ii) except as may result from
the regulatory status of the Parent or its Affiliates and except in
connection, or in compliance, with (a) the notification and waiting period
requirements of the HSR Act and (b) the approvals, filings and notifications
required by applicable Laws that are set forth in _Section 4.05_ of the
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, any Governmental Approval to be obtained or made
by the Acquiror or the applicable Affiliate of the Acquiror (as applicable),
except for any Governmental Approvals the failure to obtain or make which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.06. _Financial Information; Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) Acquiror has filed with, or furnished to, the SEC all required Acquiror
SEC Documents. As of their respective dates, the Acquiror SEC Documents

Documents, and none of the Acquiror SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to

Section 4.11. _Investment Company_. The Acquiror is not an "investment
company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act.

 



 

Section 4.12. _Securities Matters_. The Shares are being acquired by the
Acquiror for its own account and without a view to the public distribution or
sale of any of the Shares or any interest in them. The Acquiror has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares, and the
Acquiror is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment,
including a complete loss of its investment in the Shares. The Acquiror
understands and agrees that it may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or
otherwise dispose of any of the Shares other than pursuant to a registered
offering in compliance with, or a transaction exempt from, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state and foreign securities
Laws.

Section 4.14. _Financial Ability_. As of the date hereof, the Acquiror has
received an executed copy of the Bridge Loan Agreement, including all exhibits
and schedules thereto, pursuant to which the lender thereunder has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to the
Acquiror the amount of financing set forth therein. A true and complete copy
of the Bridge Loan Agreement has been provided to the Parent. The Acquiror has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Bridge
Loan Agreement to be paid on or before the date hereof and will pay all
additional fees as they become due. As of the date hereof, each of the Bridge
Loan Agreement and the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each party thereto and is in full force and effect,
has not been amended, modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect, and does not contain any material misrepresentation by the Acquiror
and no event has occurred

 



      
 

 



 

which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach thereunder on the part of the Acquiror. No
amendment or modification to, or withdrawal, termination or rescission of,
either the Bridge Loan Agreement or the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement is
contemplated, except (i) in the case of the Bridge Loan Agreement, any
termination as a result of the receipt by the Acquiror and/or its Subsidiaries
of net cash proceeds from equity offerings, debt offerings and/or asset sales
in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate amount of commitments
under the Bridge Loan Agreement and (ii) in the case of the Existing Revolving
Credit Agreement, any amendment that would not impose new or additional
conditions in a manner that would adversely affect the Acquirors ability to
borrow thereunder to fund the portion of the Cash Consideration then
contemplated to be funded thereunder. The aggregate proceeds contemplated by
the Bridge Loan Agreement together with cash on hand and amounts available to
be drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement will be sufficient for
the Acquiror to pay the Cash Consideration, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and to
satisfy all of the obligations of the Acquiror under this Agreement. No other
Contract between the Financing Sources, on the one hand, and Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, contains any conditions precedent or
other contingencies (x) related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing or any provisions that could reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing set forth in the Bridge Loan Agreement or (y) that could otherwise
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability or availability of the
Bridge Loan Agreement with respect to all or any portion of the Financing. As
of the date hereof, the Acquiror does not have any reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the Financing would not reasonably be expected to be
satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing would not reasonably be
expected to be available to the Acquiror on the date on which the Closing
should occur pursuant to _Section 2.02_.

 



 

Section 4.15. _Investigation_. The Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that it
(a) has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has
formed an independent judgment concerning, the Company, the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Business and (b) has been furnished with or given
adequate access to such information about the Company, the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Business as it has requested. The Acquiror further
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the only representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by the Parent or its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives or any other Person are the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made in this Agreement, (ii) except as
set forth in _Article III_, none of the Parent or its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives makes any other representation or warranty of any
kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, with respect

the Transaction Agreements, including any relating to the financial condition,
results of operations, assets or liabilities of any of the foregoing entities
and (iii) none of the Parent or its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives makes any representation or warranty as to (A) the operation
of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries by the Acquiror or its
Affiliates after the Closing in any manner or (B) the probable success or
profitability of the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Business
(whether before or after the Closing). Except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_, the Acquiror has not relied upon any
other representations or warranties or any other information made or supplied
by or on behalf of the Parent or its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives, and the Acquiror

 



      
 

 



 

acknowledges and agrees that none of the Parent or its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives has any liability or responsibility for any other
representation, warranty, opinion, projection, forecast, advice, statement or
information made, communicated or furnished (orally or in writing) to the
Acquiror or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives (including any
opinion, projection, forecast, advice, statement or information that may have
been or may be provided to the Acquiror by any Representative of the Parent or
its Affiliates).

broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or
other fee or commission in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of the Acquiror or its Affiliates. The Acquiror is solely
responsible for any fees and expenses payable to Credit Suisse Securities
(USA) LLC.

 



 

Section 4.17. _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) All U.S. federal Tax Returns for Income Taxes and other material Tax
Returns that have been required to be filed by or on behalf of the Acquiror
have been timely filed with the appropriate Tax Authority (after giving effect
to any valid extensions of time within which to make such filings) and each
such Tax Return is true, correct and complete in all material respects.

 



 

(b) The Acquiror has paid all material Taxes that have been due and payable by
it (whether or not shown on a Tax Return).

 



 

Section 4.18. _Disclaimer_. Except for the representations and warranties
contained in this _Article IV_, neither the Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives makes any other representation
or warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or
implied, with respect to itself, its Affiliates, their respective businesses,
the Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this
_Article IV_, (a) the Acquiror disclaims, on behalf of itself, its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, any other representations or warranties,
whether made by the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives or any other Person and (b) the Acquiror disclaims, on behalf
of itself, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, all liability
and responsibility for any other representation, warranty, opinion,
projection, forecast, advice, statement or information made, communicated or
furnished (orally or in writing) to the Parent or its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives (including any opinion, projection, forecast,
advice, statement or information that may have been or may be provided to the
Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives by any Representative of the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates).

the Transferred Subsidiaries and their respective businesses relating to
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (i) relating to information
(including employment and medical records) regarding the Employees, (ii) as
required by any Governmental Authority, including any applicable Law or
regulatory request or (iii) as may be necessary for the Parent and its
Affiliates to perform their respective obligations pursuant to the Transaction
Agreements or any other agreement between the Parent and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, that will remain in effect after the Closing, in each case subject
to compliance with all applicable privacy Laws, policies and obligations of
the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the applicable
books, data, files, information and records retained pursuant to clause (iii)
shall, if requested, be delivered to the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries at the Parents and its Affiliates expense once they are no
longer needed for the Parent and its Affiliates to perform their respective
obligations under the Transaction Agreements; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall require the Parent or its Representatives, to disclose any information
to the Acquiror and its Affiliates or take any action that would cause a
violation of any Contract to which the disclosing party or any of its
Affiliates is a party, would cause a risk of loss of legal privilege to the
party disclosing such data or information or any of its Affiliates, or would
constitute a violation of applicable Law, so long as the Parent or its
Representative, as the case may be, shall have used its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such information and protect such privacy and
any personal data without violation of applicable Law. With respect to all
original books, data, files, information and records of each of the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries existing as of the Closing Date, the Acquiror
shall, and shall cause each of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries
to, (A) comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws, including
the Code, relating to the preservation and retention of records, (B) apply
preservation and retention policies that are no less stringent than those

given the Parent ninety (90) days prior written notice of such disposition
and the opportunity (at the Parents expense) to remove and retain such
information (which shall be treated as confidential information subject to
_Section 5.05_); _provided_ that nothing herein shall require the Acquiror or
its Representatives, to disclose any information to the Parent and its

information or any of its Affiliates, or would constitute a violation of
applicable Law, so long as the Acquiror or its Representative, as the case may
be, shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
information and protect such privacy and any personal data without violation
of applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other
Transaction Agreement, to the extent that the Parent or any of its Affiliates
has retained books, records, files, tapes, software, data, documents, or other
information, or materials containing

 



      
 

 



 

both data relating to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries and data
relating to the Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Company or the
Transferred Subsidiaries), (i) that are not used in the operation of, or
necessary to, the conduct of the Business as currently conducted, (ii) that
have been or will be retained pursuant to applicable Law or for regulatory
purposes, including pursuant to a Litigation Hold or otherwise, (iii) the
possession of which by the Parent or its Affiliates would not violate any
applicable privacy Laws or contractual obligations of the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to privacy or (iv) with respect to which
it would not be commercially reasonable for the Parent to separate such data,
books, records, files, tapes, software, documents, or other materials relating
to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries from such data and materials
relating to the Parent, or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or
the Transferred Subsidiaries) (" _Archived Files_ ") pursuant to a Litigation
Hold or otherwise, the Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that the Archived
Files are solely the property of the Parent. The Parent agrees that it shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, maintain and treat any data in such
Archived Files in accordance with _Section 5.05_ as if such Archived Files
are the Acquirors confidential information and shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, maintain and dispose of such Archived Files in accordance with
applicable Law. The Parent shall provide the Acquiror, at the Acquirors
expense, reasonable access to the Archived Files relating to the Company or
the Transferred Subsidiaries during normal business hours, to the extent that
such Archived Files have not been disposed according to this _Section 5.04_.

 



 

Section 5.05. _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) The terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated July 6, 2016 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Parent and the Acquiror are
incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time all obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate except for liabilities for a breach,
if any, that arose prior to the Closing. If, for any reason, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Parent, on the one hand, and the Acquiror,
on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and
Representatives to, maintain in confidence any written, oral or other
information relating to or obtained from the other party or its Affiliates
(for this purpose, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be
considered Affiliates of the Acquiror), except that the foregoing requirements
of this _Section 5.05(a)_ shall not apply to the extent that (i) any such
information is or becomes generally available to the public other than (A) in
the case of the Acquiror, as a result of disclosure by the Parent or its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives in violation of this
_Section 5.05(b)_ and (B) in the case of the Parent, as a result of
disclosure by the Acquiror, the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary (after
the Closing Date) or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives in violation of this _Section 5.05(b)_, (ii) any
such information (including any report, statement, testimony or other
submission to a Governmental Authority) is required by applicable Law,
Governmental Order or such Governmental Authority to be disclosed, after prior
written notice has been given to the other party to the extent such notice is
permitted by applicable Law, _provided_ that no such notice is required if
prohibited by applicable Law, (iii) any such information is reasonably
necessary to be

 



      
 

 



 

disclosed in connection with any Action or in any dispute with respect to the
Transaction Agreements (including in response to any summons, subpoena or
other legal process or formal or informal investigative demand issued to the
disclosing party in the course of any litigation, arbitration, mediation,
investigation or administrative proceeding), (iv) any such information was or
becomes available to such party on a non-confidential basis and from a source
(other than a party hereto or any Affiliate or Representative of such party)
that is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with respect to such
information or (v) after the Closing, any such information becomes known or
available pursuant to or as a result of the carrying out of the provisions of
an Ancillary Agreement (which information shall be governed by the
confidentiality provisions set forth in such Ancillary Agreement). Each of the
parties hereto shall instruct its Affiliates and Representatives having access
to such information of such obligation of confidentiality; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the parties hereto may disclose information about the Tax
treatment and Tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any facts or materials relating thereto or reasonably necessary to
understand such treatment or structure). In the event that the Parent or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates,
on the other hand, becomes legally compelled to disclose any such confidential
information referred to above, the Acquiror and the Parent, as the case may
be, as the disclosing party, shall cooperate with the party whose information
is being disclosed (at such disclosing partys expense) to obtain a protective
order or similar remedy to cause such confidential information not to be
disclosed, including interposing all available objections thereto, such as
objections based on settlement privilege. In the event that such protective
order or other similar remedy is not obtained, the disclosing party shall
furnish only that portion of such confidential information that has been
legally compelled, and shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such disclosed
information. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any
information about the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries after the
Closing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Parent and its Affiliates or the
Acquiror and its Affiliates, as the case may be, may, without notifying the
Acquiror or any other Person, or Parent or any other Person, as the case may
be, share any information relating to or obtained from the Acquiror or its
Affiliates, or Parent and its Affiliates, as the case may be, with (i) any
insurance regulatory authority, (ii) the Government Sponsored Entities or the
FHFA, (iii) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or (iv) the
IRS or any other Tax Authority, in each case as the Parent deems reasonably
necessary in its good faith judgment; _provided_ that the Parent or the
Acquiror, as applicable, shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
request confidential treatment of any of the information included therein. The
Parent or the Acquiror shall promptly notify such other party in the event it
learns that any recipient set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above has been
requested or required to disclose any such information or has taken any action
that, if taken by the Parent or the Acquiror, as applicable, would be deemed a
breach of this _Section 5.05_.

 



 

Section 5.06. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 5.06_, each of the
parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to
be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under the Transaction Agreements and applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Laws, to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements as promptly as practicable, and not take any action
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and (ii) obtain as promptly as
practicable all authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, non-disapprovals
or no objections of all Governmental Authorities that may be or may become
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under the Transaction Agreements and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements, and the parties hereto shall take all
reasonable actions as may be requested by any such Governmental Authorities to
obtain such authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, non-disapprovals or
no objections. The parties hereto shall cooperate with the reasonable requests
of each other in seeking to obtain as promptly as practicable all such
authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, non-disapprovals or no
objections. Neither the Parent nor the Acquiror shall take or cause to be
taken any action that it is aware or should reasonably be aware would have the
effect of preventing, materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt
of any such required authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, non-
disapprovals or no objections. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection
with obtaining any required authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, non-
disapprovals or no objections of a Governmental Authority, neither party shall
be required to agree to any modification of the terms of the Quota Share
Agreement requested by any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto shall promptly make (which shall, for purposes of
clauses (i) through (iv) below, in no event be later than twenty (20) Business
Days after the date hereof or such other date that the parties mutually agree
in writing) all filings and notifications with all Governmental Authorities
that may be or may become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under the
Transaction Agreements and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, including (i) the
Acquiror causing "Form A" or similar change of control application to be filed
with the North Carolina Department of Insurance and each jurisdiction where

Agreements and (v) the Parent and the Acquiror each making any other filing
that may be required under any other antitrust or competition Law or by any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable
antitrust or competition Laws. The Parent and the Acquiror each shall supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Laws. The Acquiror
shall have responsibility for the filing fees associated with its HSR Act
filing, its "Form A" or similar change of control applications and its "Form
E" or similar market share notifications, and each of the Parent and the
Acquiror shall have responsibility for its other respective filing fees
associated with any other required filings.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to this _Section
5.06(c)_, but subject to the limitations set forth herein, each of the Parent

below) and the Acquiror (in all cases of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this
_Section 5.06(c)_ set forth below) shall take or cause to be taken the

interests therein of the Company or the Acquiror or eithers respective
Subsidiaries (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of,
the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect thereto) unless such proffer
or agreement constitutes a Burdensome Condition, and (C) the proffer and
agreement by the Acquiror of its willingness to take such other actions, and
promptly to effect such other actions (and the entry into agreements with, and
submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect
thereto), unless such proffer or agreement constitutes a Burdensome Condition,
in each case if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)

decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements by any Governmental Authority; and
(iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,

reasonable steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond, or, in
the case of the Acquiror, the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii)
of this _Section 5.06(c)_), necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse,
suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit
such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements. Nothing in this _Section 5.06(c)_ shall obligate
the Acquiror, the Parent, the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries
to agree to any divestitures or other remedy not conditioned on the
consummation of the Closing.

 



 

(d) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, each of
the Parent and the Acquiror shall promptly notify each other of any material
communication it

fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing (including in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting

to disclose any information that in the reasonable judgment of the Acquiror,
Acquirors Subsidiaries, Parent, the Company, any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates (as the case may be) would
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
of its obligations with respect to confidentiality or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information or confidential competitive information of the
Acquiror, the Acquirors Subsidiaries, the Parent, the Company, any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_further,_ that the Acquiror shall subject to reasonable consultation with the
Parent, control and lead all communications and strategy relating to all
filings and notifications with all Governmental Authorities; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that each partys obligations to notify the other party with
respect to communications received from a Tax Authority, as well as the rights
and obligations of the parties hereto with respect to any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding related to Taxes, shall be governed solely
by _Section 7.06_. Neither party hereto shall be required to comply with any
provision of this _Section 5.06(d)_ to the extent that such compliance would
be prohibited by applicable Law.

 



 

(e) The Company and the Acquiror will furnish each other and each others
counsel with all reasonable information concerning themselves, their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders or equity holders and
such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in connection with any
application, petition or other statement made by or on behalf of the Company
or the Acquiror to each of the Government Sponsored Entities in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. The Acquiror
acknowledges that any of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or other Governmental
Authority may require that the Acquiror commit to contribute capital, or make
capital available, to Arch Mortgage Insurance Company, the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or following Closing, or impose other conditions relating to
maintaining capital ratios or that are otherwise financial in nature, as a
condition on, to or as part of their approval or non-disapproval of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (any such requirement
or condition, a " _Financial Condition_ "). The Acquiror shall acting
reasonably and in good faith, consider and discuss with the applicable
Government Sponsored Entities or other Governmental Authority any such
proposed Financial Conditions. The Acquiror agrees to accept and comply with
any such Financial Condition unless following

 



      
 

 



 

any such discussions between the Acquiror and the applicable Government
Sponsored Entities or other Governmental Authority such Financial Condition
constitutes a Burdensome Condition.

 



 

(f) The Acquiror further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to accept
and comply, and cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to
accept and comply, with any other condition or requirement of any Governmental
Authority that is not a Burdensome Condition imposed or sought to be imposed
upon the Acquiror, any Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Acquiror, the Parent,
the Company, or any Transferred Subsidiaries of the Company as part of such
Governmental Authoritys authorization, consent, order, approval, non-
disapproval or no objection with respect to the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements.

 



 

(g) The Parent and the Acquiror shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any other authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, non-disapprovals
or no objections and make any other notifications that may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to compensate any
third party, commence or participate in litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any such
consent or approval; and _provided,_ _further_ , that Parent shall not be
required to take any action with respect to any third party unless such action
is conditioned upon the Closing.

 



 

(h) In the event that the Acquiror determines not to accept or comply with a
Burdensome Condition, the Acquiror shall (A) inform the Parent of such
Burdensome Condition in reasonable detail within five (5) Business Days after
such determination by the Acquiror (including providing a copy of any such
Burdensome Condition if provided to the Acquiror in writing), (B) provide the
Parent with ten (10) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to
advise the Governmental Authority that the Acquiror will not accept or comply
with such Burdensome Condition, and (C) reasonably cooperate with the Parent
during such period to determine if there are any mutually acceptable measures
that may be taken to mitigate or eliminate the impact of such Burdensome
Condition and otherwise satisfy the conditions to the Closing hereunder.

 



 

Section 5.07. _Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided below, from and after the Closing Date, the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by the Parents or its
Affiliates (other than the Companys and the Transferred Subsidiaries) (as
the case may be) blanket insurance policies or by any of their self-insured
programs in place, including those listed in Section 3.19 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, to the extent such insurance policies or programs cover
the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries. On or prior to the
Closing, the Parent may cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to
pay the premiums owed to the Parent for its participation in the Parents
self-insured property, casualty, management and professional liability
insurance programs, including those listed in Section 3.19 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, in each case consistent with such amounts paid by the
Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries for such premiums prior to the date
hereof. With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Company or the
Transferred Subsidiaries that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date
that are covered by the occurrence-based insurance policies listed in Section
3.19 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Acquiror shall be permitted to
make a workers

 



      
 

 



 

compensation insurance loss claim until the applicable statute of limitations
has run and shall be permitted to make any other occurrence based insurance
loss claim until the one year anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall make any
such claims if, and to the extent that, such claims are also covered by
insurance policies sponsored by the Acquiror or its Affiliates. With respect
to claims made in respect of wrongful acts, events or other circumstances
relating to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries that occurred or
existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered by the claims made-based
insurance policies listed in Section 3.19 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
the Acquiror shall be permitted to make claims under such policies in respect
of claims first made prior to the next renewal date thereof following the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Acquiror nor any of
its Affiliates shall make any such claims if, and to the extent that, such
claims are also covered by insurance policies sponsored by the Acquiror or its
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.07 _shall apply to any debt,
liabilities, commitments or obligations of any kind relating to or arising out
of any Company EandO Claims, which shall be governed by _Section 5.12._

 



 

Section 5.08. _Intercompany Obligations and Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.08(d)_, the Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take such action and make such payments as may be necessary so
that concurrently with the Closing, the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Parent and its Affiliates (other than
the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall
settle, discharge, offset, pay, repay in full, terminate, commute or
extinguish all intercompany loans, notes and advances regardless of their
maturity and all intercompany receivables and payables, including any accrued
and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of payment, for the amount due;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.08(a)_ shall not apply to any
intercompany loans, notes, advances, receivables or payables (i) set forth in
Section 5.08(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii) arising under the
Quota Share Agreement, (iii) the Net Worth Maintenance Agreement or (iv) any
Intercompany Agreement set forth in _Section 5.08(b)_. To the extent that the
amount of any such outstanding intercompany advance, receivable or payable
cannot be determined by the Parent or the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates concurrently with the
Closing, such intercompany advance receivable or payable shall be paid in full
by the Parent or the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates (as applicable) following the Closing within ten
(10) days of receipt of an invoice detailing the amount due with respect to
such intercompany advance, receivable or payable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such amounts due and payable, if any, shall have been calculated in a
manner consistent with past practice.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 7.08(d)_, the Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take such actions as may be necessary to terminate or commute,
concurrently with the Closing, all Intercompany Agreements, whether written or
oral; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.08(b)_ shall not apply to
the Quota Share Agreement, the Net Worth Maintenance Agreement or any
Intercompany Agreement set forth in Section 5.08(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.08(b)_ shall not apply
to (A) any Contract between a third party, on the one hand, and the Parent or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, to which the Company or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries is not a party, but under which the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries may otherwise derive benefits,
such as enterprise-wide licenses or "master" agreements or (B) any Contract
among (x) a third party, (y) the Parent or any of its Affiliates and (z) the
Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries. Such third party Contracts are
governed exclusively by _Section 5.10_.

 



 

(c) The Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such actions
(including obtaining all authorizations, consents, orders approvals or non-
disapprovals of all Governmental Authorities) as may be necessary to amend the
Quota Share Agreement as set forth in the form in _Section 5.08(c)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, concurrently with the Closing.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parent and the Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts
to seek termination of all obligations under the Net Worth Maintenance
Agreement to any beneficiaries thereof. To the extent any obligations under
the Net Worth Maintenance Agreement with respect to any beneficiary thereof on
or prior to Closing, the Acquiror shall promptly reimburse the Parent for any
amounts the Parent is obligated to provide, contribute, pay, loan or otherwise
make available pursuant to the Net Worth Maintenance Agreement after the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the Acquirors obligations for
reimbursement pursuant to clause or otherwise pursuant to the Net Worth
Maintenance Agreement shall not exceed the equity of United Residential
Insurance Company as of the Closing Date.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.08_ shall not apply to IT
Contracts, which are covered pursuant to _Section 5.22_.

 



 

Section 5.09. _Intellectual Property; Trade Names and Trademarks_.

 



 

(a) The Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that
the Acquiror is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right,
title or interest in or to any Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to
the Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries or any Owned Intellectual Property), including the
Intellectual Property identified in _Section 5.09(a)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and the names "AIG," "AIG, Inc." or "AI," or any trade,
corporate or business names, trademarks, tag-lines, identifying logos, trade
dress, monograms, slogans, service marks, domain names, brand names or any
other name or source identifiers related thereto or employing the wording
"AIG" or any "AI" formative marks, "American International" formative marks or
any derivation or variation of any of the foregoing (for example, among
others, AI, AI RISK, AIA, AIU, as well as American International, American
International Group, American International Underwriters, American
International Assurance) or any confusingly similar trade, corporate or
business name, trademark, tag-line, identifying logo, trade dress, monogram,
slogan, service mark, domain name, brand name or other name or source
identifier (including any registrations and applications relating thereto)
(collectively, the " _Parent Names and Marks_ "), and, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this _Section 5.09_ or in any Ancillary Agreement,
neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights in or to
any of the Parent Names and Marks.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.09_, following the
Closing Date, the Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
immediately cease and discontinue any

 



      
 

 



 

and all uses of the Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the Parent
or any of its Affiliates, including the Parent Names and Marks. The Acquiror,
for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that any and all rights of the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries to the Intellectual Property licensed to the
Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to any written agreements or
other arrangements, whether written or oral, with the Parent or its Affiliates
(except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 5.09_), shall terminate on
the Closing Date without recourse by the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing Date, the Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, immediately cease and discontinue any and all uses of the
Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, and in no event later
than ninety (90) days (or such longer period as required by a Governmental
Authority) (the " _Transitional Use Period_ ") after the Closing Date or as
otherwise specified in this _Section 5.09(d)_, the Acquiror shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, destroy or exhaust all materials bearing the Parent
Names and Marks, including signage, advertising, promotional materials,
packaging, inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery,
business cards, web sites, invoices, receipts, forms, product, training and
service literature and materials, and other materials (" _Materials_ "), and
as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, and in no event later than
ninety (90) days, the Acquiror shall make all filings with any Governmental
Authority to effect the elimination of any use of the Parent Names and Marks
from corporate names and identities of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries and shall deliver a certificate to the Parent confirming such
filings. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.09_, the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries shall during the Transitional Use Period have the
right to use such existing Materials solely as such Materials were used in
connection with their existing businesses as of the Closing. The Acquiror, for
itself and its Affiliates, agrees that the use of the Parent Names and Marks
during the Transitional Use Period shall only be with respect to good and
services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods
and services with respect to which the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries used the Parent Names and Marks immediately prior to the Closing.
The Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that after the Closing the
Acquiror and its Affiliates shall not expressly, or by implication, do
business as or represent themselves as the Parent or its Affiliates and shall
use all reasonable efforts to ensure that there is no confusion that the
Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries are no longer affiliated with the
Parent or its Affiliates.

 



 

(e) The Acquiror, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees that
irreparable damage would occur if this _Section 5.09_ were breached.

 



 

(f) With respect to the registered or applied for trademark registrations and
domain name registrations incorporating both "AIG" and "United Guaranty" or
"AIG" and "UG" set forth in Section 5.09(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
the Parent shall expressly abandon such items as soon as practicable after the
Closing. The Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Parent and its Affiliates
shall have no right to use the "United Guaranty" name or any Owned
Intellectual Property after the Closing Date. The Parent further agrees and
acknowledges that, after the Closing Date, as between the Parent and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, the Company and the Transferred

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries shall have the sole and exclusive right to use the "United
Guaranty" name and mark in all jurisdictions throughout the world, and the
Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, not to oppose,
challenge or otherwise hinder, directly or indirectly, the Acquiror, the
Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, or any of their successors or
assigns, rights to register the Owned Intellectual Property in any
jurisdiction, and shall cooperate with the Acquiror, the Company or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries to overcome any objections from relevant trademark
registries to the extent based on the existence of the items disclosed in
Section 5.09(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Certain Third Party Contracts of the Parent and the Company_.

 



 

(a) With respect to any material Contract between a third party, on the one
hand, and the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, to which the Parent or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries) is not a party, but under which the Parent or
any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
may otherwise derive benefits, the Parent and its Affiliates shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to occur, on or prior to the Closing,
the termination, amendment, separation or other action such that the Company
and any Transferred Subsidiary have no future liability or obligation under
such Contract; _provided_ that none of the Parent or any of its Affiliates
shall be required to compensate any third party, commence or participate in
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party in connection with this _Section 5.10(a)_.

 



 

(b) With respect to any material Contract between a third-party, on the one
hand, and the Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, but under
which the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries may otherwise derive
benefits, such as enterprise-wide licenses or "master agreements," the parties
shall cooperate in good faith and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to occur, on or prior to the Closing, amendment, separation,
execution of a comparable Contract or other action such that the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries continue to derive substantially comparable use
and benefit of such Contract as was in place before such amendment,
separation, new contract or other action; _provided_ that none of the Parent
or any of its Affiliates nor the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates shall be
required to compensate any third party, commence or participate in litigation
or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third
party in connection with this _Section 5.10(b)_.

 



 

(c) If the parties are unable to complete the actions contemplated in _Section
5.10(a)_ or _(b)_ , the parties hereto agree that, from and after the Closing,
(i) the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall not have any rights,
obligations or liabilities or be entitled to any benefits, under such
Contracts and (ii) the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall promptly
reimburse and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent or any of its
Affiliates for any Losses relating to or arising out of the failure to obtain
such consent or approval.

 



 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.10_, shall not apply to IT
Contracts, which are covered pursuant to _Section 5.22_.

 



   

     
 

 



 

Section 5.11. _Parent Corporate Credit Card Program_. Concurrently with the
Closing, the Parent and the Acquiror shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, take such actions as may be necessary to terminate the
participation of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries and their
respective employees in the Credit Card Program. From time to time following
the Closing, the Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to promptly reimburse and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Parent or any of its Affiliates for any amounts incurred by the Parent or any
of its Affiliates under the Credit Card Program on behalf of the Company or
any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or their respective employees to the
extent that the Parent and its Affiliates have not previously been reimbursed
for such amounts.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Company E andO Claims_. Effective as of the Closing, (a) the
Acquiror shall assume and discharge or perform when due, and shall be liable
for and pay, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent and its
Affiliates from and against, all debts, liabilities, commitments and
obligations of any kind relating to or arising out of any Company EandO Claims
and (b) the Parent and its Affiliates shall no longer have any responsibility
of any nature with respect to any Company EandO Claims.

 



 

Section 5.13. _Parent Money Market Fund_. On or prior to the Closing, the
Parent shall cause each of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to
transfer all of the funds of each of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries out of any money market fund maintained, owned, controlled,
beneficially owned by the Parent or its Affiliates (or to which Parent or its
Affiliates is the beneficiary) and transfer all such funds to the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries; _provided_ that all such funds shall be in cash
in U.S. dollars or U.S. Treasuries. The Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use reasonable efforts to pay to the Company and/or the
Transferred Subsidiaries within forty-five (45) days of the Closing Date any
accrued and unpaid interest with respect to any such transferred funds.

 



 

Section 5.14. _Acquiror Financing_.

 



 

(a) The Acquiror will use commercially reasonable best efforts to take all
actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Bridge Loan Agreement, including
using commercially reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the
Bridge Loan Agreement in accordance with its terms and subject to the
conditions there in and enforce its rights thereunder and (ii) to satisfy (or
cause its Subsidiaries to satisfy) on a timely basis (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions to obtaining the
Financing that are applicable to it as set forth in the Bridge Loan Agreement.
In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Bridge Loan Agreement, the Acquiror
shall promptly notify the Parent of such unavailability and, to its knowledge,
the reason therefor, and the Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event, any such portion from alternative sources (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient, together with its other then available
resources, to finance the Cash Consideration and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and on conditions to funding that are not
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Parent or the Acquiror (in
the reasonable judgment of the Acquiror) than the conditions to funding set
forth in the Bridge Loan Agreement. The Acquiror shall deliver to the Parent
true and complete copies

 



      
 

 



 

of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have
committed to provide the Acquiror with the Alternative Financing (except for
customary non-disclosure agreements and except that fee letters may be
redacted in a customary manner to remove the fee amounts and other terms that
could not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Alternative
Financing). The Acquiror shall not agree to or permit, without the Parents
prior written consent, any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or
any waiver of any of its rights under, or the designation of a subsidiary
borrower pursuant to, the Bridge Loan Agreement if such amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or designation of borrower (A) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing, or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) materially
delay or prevent the Closing, (II) make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur, (III) reduce the aggregate amount of the commitments available under
the Bridge Loan Agreement (except pursuant to the terms thereof in connection
with any equity or debt offering or asset sale; it being understood that the
Acquiror shall not optionally reduce the commitments under the Bridge Loan
Agreement to an amount below the amount that is required, together with cash
on hand and amounts available to be drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit
Agreement, to pay the Cash Consideration, consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and
satisfy all of the obligations of the Acquiror under this Agreement), (IV)
adversely impact the ability of the Acquiror to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the likelihood of the Acquiror doing so or
(V) adversely impact the ability of the Acquiror to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Bridge Loan Agreement or the other definitive agreements
relating to the Financing. The Acquiror shall promptly deliver to the Parent
copies of any amendment, supplement or other modification of the Bridge Loan
Agreement. The Acquiror shall give the Parent prompt written notice of (x) any
material breach by any party to the Bridge Loan Agreement of which the
Acquiror becomes aware or any termination of the Bridge Loan Agreement, or (y)
any material dispute or disagreement between or among the Acquiror, on the one
hand, and the Financing Sources on the other hand. If at any time for any
reason the Acquiror believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Bridge Loan Agreement,
the Acquiror shall deliver prompt written notice to the Parent. The Acquiror
shall keep the Parent informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to
the Parent copies of all related documents promptly upon the request of the
Parent (which may be redacted, if applicable, in a customary manner to remove
the fee amounts and other terms that could not reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate
principal amount of the Financing). In no event shall the unavailability of
any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing)
by or to the Acquiror excuse the Acquiror from performance of any of its
obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
obligations of the Acquiror in this _Section 5.14(a)_ relating to the Bridge
Credit Agreement (or any Alternative Financing) shall not apply from and after
the date on which the Acquiror shall have generated gross proceeds from
Financing other than under the Bridge Loan Agreement of at least the aggregate
amount of commitments under the Bridge Loan Agreement on the date hereof.

 



 

(b) The Parent agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to use their
commercially

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable best efforts, to provide such customary cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by the Acquiror to assist the Acquiror in the arrangement
of the Financing, including using commercially reasonable best efforts in (i)
assisting with the preparation of Offering Documents (and any supplements
thereto), (ii) preparing and furnishing to the Acquiror and the Financing
Sources as promptly as practicable all Required Information and all other
available pertinent information and disclosures relating to the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries (including UG Asia and its Subsidiaries)
(including their businesses, operations, financial projections and prospects)
as may be reasonably requested by the Acquiror to assist in preparation of the
Offering Documents and any supplements thereto, including any financial
statements, data or other information (A) of the type required by Regulation
S-X or Regulation S-K, or (B) for the Acquiror to prepare pro forma financial
information and for the Companys independent auditors to provide comfort
letters (including customary "negative assurances"), (iii) having appropriate
members of senior management of the Company and its Representatives to
participate in a reasonable number of presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions, customary meetings and sessions with ratings
agencies in connection with the Financing and reasonably cooperating with
marketing efforts related to the Financing, including direct contact between
such senior management and Representatives of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Financing Sources and potential lenders and investors in
the Financing, (iv) engaging the Companys independent auditors using
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such auditors to deliver comfort
letters and consents in connection with any Financing involving an offering of
securities, (v) cooperating with the Financing Sources requests for due
diligence to the extent customary and reasonable, (vi) providing, at least
five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all documentation and other
information about the Company and each of the Transferred Subsidiaries to the
extent requested at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, that
relates to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act, and (vii)
providing customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources to the
extent requested. The Parent will, upon request of the Acquiror, use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to periodically update any information to
be included in any Offering Document so that the Acquiror may ensure that such
information, when taken as a whole, does not contain as of the time provided,
giving effect to any supplements, any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein not materially misleading. Nothing in this _Section
5.14(b)_ shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A) require the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any
costs or expenses, or otherwise incur any liability, in each case, to the
extent the Acquiror does not have a reimbursement or indemnity obligation to
the Parent or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)_ (B) require
the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to
(x) enter into any instrument or Contract that is effective prior to the
occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective if the Closing does not
occur or (y) adopt any resolution or otherwise take any corporate or similar
action, (C) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Parent
or its Subsidiaries or (D) conflict with or violate laws or result in a
contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any material contract to which the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. The Acquiror shall promptly,
upon the written request by the Parent, (i) reimburse the Parent for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys
and accountants fees) incurred by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with providing assistance requested by the

 



      
 

 



 

Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)_, and (ii) indemnify the Parent
and its Subsidiaries for any damages, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with providing assistance
requested by the Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)_. The Parent
hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is reasonable and customary for
such purposes and that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Parent or any its Affiliates or the reputation or goodwill of
the Parent or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective products,
services, offerings or intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding any other
provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between the Parent and
the Acquiror, the Parent agrees that the Acquiror may share non-public or
confidential information regarding the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries with the Financing Sources, and that the Acquiror and such
Financing Sources may share such information with potential Financing Sources
in connection with any marketing efforts (including any syndication) in
connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that the sharing of such

substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent.

likely to result in the failure of any condition to the Closing or result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Acquiror Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable and (ii) the receipt of any material notice or other communication
from any third Person alleging that the approval, consent, authorization,
permission or act of, or the making by the Parent, the Acquiror or any of
their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, of any notices to or
declaration, filing or registration with, such third Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
that such transactions otherwise may violate the rights of or confer remedies
upon such third Person; provided, however, that in each case, such disclosure
shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or any failure of a condition to the Closing, or to otherwise
limit or affect in any way the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice; and provided, further, that failure to deliver any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.16(a)_ shall not result in a failure of
any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ or liability to any party

 



      
 

 



 

hereto under _Article VIII_ unless the underlying event or breach would
independently result in the failure of such condition or such liability.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parent, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand,
shall promptly notify the other of any Action that shall be instituted or
threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the
legality of any transaction contemplated by the Transaction Agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, such disclosure shall not be
deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
or to satisfy any condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and provided, further,
that failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.16(b)_ shall
not result in a failure of any condition set forth in _Article VIII_.

_Restricted Activity_ ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.18(a)_, and
without implication that the following activities (or activities not listed

traded on a national securities exchange of any Person engaged in the
Restricted Activity which ownership interest represents at all times not more
than ten (10) percent of the aggregate voting power or outstanding Capital

(vii) merging, consolidating or otherwise engaging in a business combination

Parent Entity immediately prior to consummation of such transaction do not
immediately after consummation of such transaction own sixty (60) percent or
more of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of the

the prohibitions of this _Section 5.18_ shall immediately terminate and be of
no further effect); and

 



 

(viii) purchasing or acquiring (through merger, stock purchase or purchase of

directed at such persons, or (ii) solicitation of such Employees who initiate
discussions with any Parent Entity regarding such employment with any Parent
Entity without any direct or indirect solicitation by any Parent Entity;
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.18(c)_
shall prevent any Parent Entity from directly or indirectly soliciting for
employment, employing or retaining the services of any Person whose employment
with the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary was terminated after six (6)
months from the date of such termination.

 



 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this
_Section 5.18(d)_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but
for these covenants, the parties hereto would not have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge that this _Section 5.18(d)_
constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance
or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement or any other
document contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) The Parent expressly acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth
in this _Section 5.18(e)_, including the geographic scope and duration of
such covenants, are necessary in order to protect and maintain the proprietary
interests and other legitimate business interests of the Acquiror and its
Affiliates, and that any violation thereof could result in irreparable injury
to the Acquiror and its Affiliates that could not be readily ascertainable or
compensable in terms of money, and therefore the Acquiror and its Affiliates
shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as damages, which rights
shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which
it may be entitled.

 



 

Section 5.19. _Certain Swap Arrangements_. Effective as of the Closing,

capacity as such) (each, a " _Company Releasee_ "), arising out of, based upon
or resulting from any Contract, transaction, event, circumstance, action,
failure to act or occurrence of any sort or type, whether known or unknown,
and which occurred, existed, was taken, permitted or begun prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section
5.20(a)_ shall release, discharge, waive or otherwise affect the rights or
obligations of any party to the extent related to or arising out of (i) any
intercompany receivable or payable set forth in Section 5.08(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) any Intercompany Agreement set forth in Section
5.08(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (iii) the Quota Share Agreement or

proceeding of any kind against any Company Releasee based upon any matter
released pursuant to this _Section 5.20(a)_. The parties hereto hereby
acknowledge and agree that the execution of this Agreement shall not
constitute an acknowledgment of or an admission by any Parent Releasor or
Company Releasee of the existence of any such claims or of liability for any
matter or precedent upon which any liability may be asserted.

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the Acquiror, for itself and on behalf of its

_Acquiror Releasor_ "), to irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily release,
discharge and forever waive and relinquish all claims, demands, obligations,
liabilities, defenses, affirmative defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, actions
and causes of action of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown,

in the future, against any of the Parent and its Affiliates and their
respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, officers, directors,
partners and employees (in each case in their capacity as such) (each, a "
_Parent Releasee_ "), arising out of, based upon or resulting from any
Contract, transaction, event, circumstance, action, failure to act or
occurrence of any sort or type, whether known or unknown, and which occurred,
existed, was taken, permitted or begun prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to the Acquiror Releasors that are not the
Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries or their respective successors, heirs
or executors, nothing in this _Section 5.20(b)_ shall release, waive,
discharge or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any such party to
the extent such rights or obligations do not arise out of any claims, demands,
obligations, liabilities, defenses, affirmative defenses, setoffs,
counterclaims, actions or causes of action the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries may have had against any Parent Releasee prior to the Closing
Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing contained in this _Section
5.20(b)_ shall release, discharge, waive or otherwise affect the rights or
obligations of any party to the extent related to or arising out of (i) any
intercompany receivable or payable set forth in Section 5.08(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) any Intercompany Agreement set forth in Section
5.08(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (iii) the Quota Share Agreement or
(iv) the Net Worth Maintenance Agreement (subject to the limitations set forth

arising under the terms of any Transaction

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or any claim alleging fraud or intentional misconduct. The Acquiror
shall, and shall cause each Acquiror Releasor to, refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim or demand or commencing, instituting or
causing to be commenced, any legal proceeding of any kind against any Parent
Releasee based upon any matter released pursuant to this _Section 5.20(b)_.
The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that the execution of this
Agreement shall not constitute an acknowledgment of or an admission by any
Acquiror Releasor or Parent Releasee of the existence of any such claims or of
liability for any matter or precedent upon which any liability may be
asserted.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 5.20_, the releases set forth in this _Section 5.20_ shall not
release any claims of either Party pursuant to the provisions of _Article
VII_ or _Article X_ herein.

 



 

Section 5.21. _Pre-Closing Intellectual Property Transfers_. On or prior to
the Closing Date, (a) the Parent shall, and shall cause, the assignment and
transfer to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries of any and all right,
title and interest held by the Parent or any retained Affiliate in and to the
Owned Intellectual Property and all other Intellectual Property and (b) the
Parent shall promptly file for recordal with the applicable Intellectual
Property registries, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office
and domain name registrars, all instruments and other documents to record the
transfer of such ownership with respect to the Owned Registered Intellectual

Section 5.22. _Information Technology Contracts_.

 



 

(a) As used herein, " _IT Contracts_ " means all Contracts relating to Company
IT Systems, whether the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary is a party to
such Contract, or otherwise takes the benefits or rights under such Contract
as an Affiliate of the Parent or any other Affiliates of the Parent, such as
enterprise-wide licenses or "master" agreements.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consents, solely with respect to IT Contracts to which the Company or
any Transferred Subsidiary is a party, or new licenses from applicable third
parties to enable the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to have, on and
after the Closing Date, substantially the same rights, use or benefit they
have under such IT Contracts as of the Closing Date. With respect to any IT
Contract that expires or is terminated between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, or otherwise the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries will no longer, as of the Closing Date, derive any benefits, use
or rights under such IT Contract on substantially the same scope as prior to
the Closing Date (each a " _Non-Transferred IT Contract_ "), the Acquiror
(acting on behalf of itself or the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary)
shall have sole right and responsibility to obtain replacement or substitute
Contracts for the Non-Transferred IT Contracts. The Acquiror acknowledges and
agrees that such replacement or substitute Contracts for the Non-Transferred
IT Contracts may include the incurrence of increased costs. The Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in connection with such efforts
by the Acquiror, including by causing the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to promptly provide information reasonably requested in writing
by the Acquiror to enable the Acquiror to determine the amount of licenses,
users or workstations or similar metrics, as applicable, required by the
Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to each Non-Transferred IT
Contract.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) All IT Acquisition Costs (as defined below) incurred by the Acquiror (or
as the case may be, the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries) on and
after the Closing Date in connection with such replacement or substitute IT
Contracts shall be borne solely by the Acquiror up to an amount consistent
with maintenance and licensing costs for IT Contracts of the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries for the twelve (12) month period ending on June 30,
2016 to be mutually agreed in good faith by the parties within ten (10)
Business Days of this Agreement. The Parties agree that all IT Acquisition
Costs incurred by the Acquiror in excess of such amount shall be equally
(50/50 percent) shared by the Acquiror and the Parent. Parent shall pay its
share of the IT Acquisition Costs promptly upon request by the Acquiror (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days of such request), in immediately
available funds, to the account(s) designated by the Acquiror. For the
purposes hereof, " _IT Acquisition Costs_ " shall mean any fees and costs
payable to third parties in connection with replacement or substitute IT
Contracts.

best efforts to cause the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary, as applicable,
to dividend or contribute to the Parent (or its Affiliate, which for purpose
of this _Section 5.23_ shall not include the Company or a Transferred
Subsidiary) prior to the Closing the Run-Off UGC Entities. If Parent is unable
to dividend or contribute the Run-Off UGC Entities, the Acquiror shall be
permitted to assign to any Subsidiary of the Acquiror the Acquirors right to
acquire the Run-Off UGC Entities.

 



 

Section 5.24. _Investment Assets_. The Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause, subject to fiduciary duties and obligations and
applicable Law, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to hold as of the
Closing no more than $50.0 million in the aggregate of Investment Assets that
are Private Securities.

 



 

Section 5.25. _Further Action_. The Parent and the Acquiror and their
respective Affiliates shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed
and delivered, such documents and other instruments and shall take, or shall
cause to be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **EMPLOYEE MATTERS**

 



 

Section 6.01. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 6.01_, as of the
Closing Date, the Parent shall cause the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to terminate their participation in each Parent Benefit Plan that
is not a Company Benefit Plan, and in no event shall any Employee be entitled
to accrue any benefits under such Parent Benefit Plans with respect to
services rendered or compensation paid on or after the Closing Date. The
parties hereto agree that the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall
retain all rights and obligations under each Company Benefit Plan on and after
the Closing Date. The Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, take all
actions necessary so that (i) as of the Closing Date, only

 



      
 

 



 

Employees or former employees of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary
(including their dependents, spouses, or beneficiaries) are participants in
(or otherwise have any rights with respect to) the Company Benefit Plans and
(ii) except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the Acquiror nor
any of its Affiliates shall have or assume any assets related to, obligations
under or liabilities with respect to (and the Acquiror and its Affiliates
shall be indemnified and held harmless with respect to) any Parent Benefit
Plan other than a Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, subject to the written consent of the Acquiror
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) other than as set forth
in _Section 6.01(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (i) the employment of
each employee of the Parent or any of its Affiliates whose duties relate
primarily to the Business and who at such time is not already employed by the
Company or a Transferred Subsidiary shall be transferred to the Company or
such Transferred Subsidiary (other than an employee who is on (A) long-term
disability or other unpaid medical leave or (B) leave due to a workplace
injury covered by a workers compensation policy or program incurred more than
six months prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent
the failure to transfer any such employee violates applicable Law, as
determined by the Parent in good faith and in consultation with the Acquiror,
such employee shall be transferred to the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary
in accordance with this _Section 6.01(b)_) and (ii) the employment of each
employee of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary whose duties do not relate
primarily to the Business shall be transferred to the Parent or an Affiliate
of the Parent (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries).
Parent shall assume any and all obligations for and shall pay, or cause its
Affiliates to assume any and all obligation for and pay, any severance or
other obligations that arise as a result of the transfer (or termination) of
any employee of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary to be transferred as
described in this _Section 6.01(b)_ and shall assume and indemnify and hold
Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries harmless from any and
all such liabilities. For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall take all
action necessary to provide that during each Employees employment with the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates during such period, (A) such Employee shall
receive base compensation at a rate not less than such Employees base
compensation as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, (B) such
Employee shall be eligible for total incentive compensation opportunities that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the total incentive
compensation opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of the
Acquiror and its Affiliates and (C) such Employee shall be eligible for
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the Acquiror and
its Affiliates. The parties agree to discuss in good faith between the date
hereof and the Closing the potential transfer on mutually agreeable terms to
the Acquiror of certain employees of the Parents Philippine Affiliates who
support the Business.

 



 

(c) For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, benefit accruals and
benefit levels under all benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained
by the Acquiror or its Affiliates, the Acquiror shall give each Employee full
credit for such Employees service with the Parent, the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates to the same extent
recognized by the Parent, the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary and their
respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, except with
respect to defined benefit plan accruals or to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits for the

 



      
 

 



 

same period of service. In addition, the Acquiror shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all benefit plans
established or maintained by the Acquiror to the extent coverage under any
such plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Parent Benefit Plan in
which such Employee participated immediately before the Closing, (ii) for
purposes of each benefit plan maintained by the Acquiror providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Employee, any evidence of
insurability requirements, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such plan to be waived for such Employee and his or
her covered dependents, and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by any
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the corresponding Parent Benefit Plan ending on the Closing Date to be
taken into account under the benefit plan of the Acquiror for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year.

 



 

(d) The Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to
recognize and provide all accrued but unused vacation and sick pay of the
Employees as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the Parent or one of its Affiliates is required under applicable Law to
make a payment in settlement of accrued vacation or paid time off of an
Employee, the Acquiror shall reimburse and hold harmless the Parent and its
Affiliates for such payment.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall assume any and all
obligation for and shall pay, or cause the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to assume any and all obligation for and pay, any retention
bonuses in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount set forth on _Section
6.01(e)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and any annual incentive bonuses
under the annual incentive bonus plans set forth on _Section 6.01(e)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, whether the obligation therefor arises before,
after or as a result of the Closing, payable to any Employee pursuant to the
terms of the bonus plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and
applicable to such Employees (in each case to the extent not paid by the
Parent or any of its Affiliates, the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Acquiror shall
pay, or shall cause the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries to pay, an
aggregate amount in bonuses in respect of the foregoing plans and arrangements
that is no less than the amount accrued on the Reference Balance Sheet (as
adjusted through the Closing Date in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis). From and after the Closing Date, neither the Parent nor any
of its Affiliates shall retain any responsibility for such payment
obligations, regardless of when such amounts were earned or accrued.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Acquirors obligation under this _Section
6.01(e)_ shall include an obligation by the Acquiror to pay any Employee who
experiences a termination of employment with the Acquiror or its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) on or after the
Closing Date any annual incentive bonus amount to which he or she would have
been entitled on such a termination of employment under the terms of the
applicable bonus plan set forth on _Section 6.01(e)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) The Parent shall retain the responsibility for payment of all covered
medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability claims or expenses
pursuant to the Parent Benefit Plans (other than any Company Benefit Plan)
incurred by any Employee prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date, and the Acquiror shall not assume nor shall the Company nor any
of the Transferred Subsidiaries be responsible for any liability with respect
to such claims. The Acquiror shall remit to the Parent all Employee premiums
due for medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability coverage
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date, but which, as of the
Closing Date, had not been collected and remitted to the Parent or an
Affiliate of the Parent (other than the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries). With respect to the Employees, on and after the Closing Date,
the Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have the
liability and obligation for, and neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any liability or obligation for (i) any medical, dental, life
insurance, long-term disability or other welfare benefit claims incurred on or
after the Closing Date or (ii) any short-term disability, sick pay or salary
continuation benefits (and, for purposes of this provision, payments to an
Employee in excess of insured workers compensation benefits shall be
considered salary continuation benefits), _provided_ that such liability and
obligation of the Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall
not include any long-term disability benefits that are provided under the
Parents long-term disability plan with respect to any Employee (1) whose
disability commenced prior to the Closing Date and (2) who has continued to
pay the applicable long-term disability premiums under the Parents long-term
disability policy for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the date that such Employee is eligible for long-term disability benefits
under such long-term disability plan (and the Parent shall accept such premium
payment from, and cause such long-term disability benefits to be provided to,
any Employee who satisfies clauses (1) and (2) of this proviso). For purposes
of this _Section 6.01(f)_, a claim or expense shall be deemed to have been
incurred as follows: (i) for health, dental and prescription drug claims, upon
provision of each such service, (ii) for life, accidental death and
dismemberment and business travel accident insurance claims, upon the death or
accident giving rise to such claims, (iii) for hospital-provided health,
dental, prescription drug claims or the claims which become payable with
respect to any hospital confinement, upon commencement of such confinement,
except that the Parents liability for such claims shall not extend to costs
unrelated to the original condition requiring the hospital confinement, and
(iv) for short-term and long-term disability claims, upon the injury or
condition giving rise to such claims, regardless of whether such claims are
made and/or identified prior to or after the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) The Acquiror shall be responsible for providing the continuation of group
health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code to any Employee (and
in each case their qualified beneficiaries) whose "qualifying event" within
the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code occurs after the Closing Date. The
Parent shall be responsible for providing the continuation of group health
coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code to any Employee or former
employee of the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries (and in each
case their qualified beneficiaries) whose "qualifying event" within the
meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code occurs on or before the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) The Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to, and each of them hereby does, assume all liability and
obligation for, and neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall retain
any liability or obligation for, (i) severance pay and obligations payable to
any former employee of the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries who,
as of the Closing Date, is receiving or due to receive severance payments and
benefits from the Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any of the
Transferred

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries from and after the Closing Date under the applicable severance
plan listed in Section 6.01(h) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and (ii)
severance pay and obligations payable to any Employee who is terminated by the
Acquiror, the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary on or after the Closing
Date. With respect to any Employee whose employment is terminated by the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates during the 12-month period immediately
following the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall provide, or shall cause its
Affiliates to provide, severance benefits to such Employee, which shall be
determined and payable in accordance with either (A) the severance benefit
plan listed in Section 6.01(h) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule maintained by
the Parent or any of its Affiliates for the benefit of such Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date or (B) the severance benefit plan
maintained for similarly situated employees of the Acquiror and its Affiliates
at the time of such Employees termination of employment, whichever is more
favorable to the Employee, in each case taking into account all service with
the Parent, the Acquiror and their respective Affiliates in determining the
amount of severance benefits payable.

 



 

(i) The Parent shall retain the obligation and liability for any workers
compensation or similar workers protection claims of any Employee or former
employee of the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries incurred prior
to the Closing Date. The Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries to, assume the obligation and liability for any
workers compensation or similar workers protection claims of any Employee
incurred on or after the Closing Date.

 



 

(j) The Acquiror shall make available to the Employees a flexible spending
account plan for medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing
plan established or maintained under Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code
(" _Acquiror s FSA_"), effective as of the Closing Date. As of the Closing
Date, (i) the Acquiror shall credit the applicable account under the
Acquirors FSA of each Employee participating in the Parent Benefit Plan
maintained pursuant to Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code (" _Parent s
FSA_") with an amount equal to the balance of such Employees account under
the Parents FSA immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii), as applicable,
(A) the Parent shall transfer (or cause to be transferred) to the Acquiror
within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date a cash payment equal to the
excess, if any, of the aggregate amount withheld from Employees compensation
under the Parents FSA for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs over
the aggregate amount of reimbursements paid to Employees under the Parents
FSA for such plan year or (B) the Acquiror shall transfer to the Parent a cash
payment equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate amount of reimbursements
paid to Employees under the Parents FSA for the plan year in which Closing
Date occurs over the aggregate amount withheld from Employees compensation
under the Parents FSA for such plan year, and (iii) the Parent shall be
relieved of any further rights or obligations to the Employees under the
Parents FSA. The Acquiror and the Parent intend that the actions to be taken
pursuant to this _Section 6.01(j)_ be treated as an assumption by the
Acquiror of the portion of the Parents FSA and the elections made thereunder
attributable to such Employees. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
the Parent have any liability or obligation under the Acquirors FSA.

 



 

(k) Prior to the Closing Date and thereafter (as applicable), the Acquiror
shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to, or
the establishment of, a Tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan
designated by the Acquiror in which

 



      
 

 



 

Employees will participate (the " _Acquiror s 401(k) Plan_") to permit each
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including of loans) in
an amount in cash and participant notes evidencing plan loans equal to the
full account balance distributed or distributable to such Employee from the
American International Group, Inc. Incentive Savings Plan (the " _Parent s
401(k) Plan_") to the Acquirors 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable following
the Closing Date, the Parent shall take all necessary actions to ensure that
contributions (including salary deferrals and matching contributions) are made
to the Employees accounts in the Parents 401(k) Plan with respect to the
period of service ending on the Closing Date and without regard to any last
day or minimum hours of service requirements.

 



 

(l) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Parent shall vest the unvested
accrued benefits, if any, of the Employees who participated in the Parents
tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, and the Acquiror shall reimburse
the Parent for the incremental liability associated with such accelerated
vesting (as determined in good faith by the Parents actuary in accordance
with the terms of such pension plan) by cash payment not to exceed $200,000 on
the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Parent agrees to vest
the unvested accrued benefits of any Employees under the American
International Group, Inc. Non-Qualified Retirement Income Plan (as amended) ("
_Parent s Nonqualified Plan_"), and Acquiror shall make a cash payment to the
Parent on the Closing Date in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $2,000,000
or (ii) the present value of all vested benefits (including those accelerated
in accordance with the preceding clause) held by such employees under Parents
Nonqualified Plan determined as of the date and in accordance with the
methodology set forth in _Section 6.01(l)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(m) Prior to the Closing, prior to making any written or oral communications
to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that
are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Acquiror,
the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall provide the Parent, or,
except for any communication made by the Parent to all U.S. employees of the
Parent, the Parent, the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall provide
the Acquiror, as the case may be, with a copy of the intended communication.
Except for any communication made by the Parent to all U.S. employees of the
Parent, the Parent or the Acquiror, as applicable, shall have a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on the communication and the Parent and
the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries need not provide the Acquiror with any
communication consistent with the terms set forth in this Agreement. The
parties agree to cooperate in good faith with and to give each other party
reasonable information about each others benefit programs applicable to
Employees to facilitate compliance with this _Section 6.01_.

 



 

(n) The Acquiror and the Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Section 6.01_ are included for the sole benefit of the
Acquiror and the Parent and nothing contained herein shall (i) be construed as
an amendment to any employee benefit plan or program, (ii) create any third
party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person, including any employee
or former employee of any of the Acquiror, the Parent, the Company, the
Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (iii)

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise obligate the Acquiror or the Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates to maintain any particular employee benefit plan or retain the
employment of any particular employee following the Closing Date.

 



 

(o) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, the Parent will deliver
to the Acquiror not later than thirty (30) business days prior to Closing a
true, correct and complete list, as of such date, setting forth for each
Employee based in the United States: (A) the Employees specific employing
entity; (B) the Employees date of hire; (C) the Employees titles or
positions; (D) the Employees base salary or base wage rate; (E) the
Employees target annual bonus or commission opportunities and target long-
term incentive opportunities, if applicable; (F) the Employees status as
"exempt" or "nonexempt" for overtime eligibility purposes; (G) the Employees
main work location; and (H) the Employees pay grade.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 7.01. _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) In accordance with past practice (except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, the Section 338(h)(10) Election or the final Section
338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule), the Parent shall file or cause to be filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries (i) for Pre-Closing Taxable Periods (but only
with respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary on a combined, consolidated, unitary or
similar basis with the Parent or any Affiliate of the Parent (other than the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary) and not Tax Returns required to be
filed separately by the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary) or (ii) that
are due on or before the Closing Date (with respect to other Tax Returns), and
in each case the Parent shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) The Acquiror shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns for
Pre-Closing Taxable Periods that are required to be filed by or with respect
to the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary that are not Tax Returns which
Parent is required to file or cause to be filed pursuant to _Section
7.01(a)_. The Acquiror shall prepare such Tax Returns in accordance with the
past practice of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries (except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, the Section 338(h)(10) Election or the
final Section 338 Allocation Schedule) and shall deliver any such Tax Returns
that relate to Income Taxes (" _Income Tax Returns_ ") to the Parent for its
review at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) for filing. The Acquiror shall deliver a
final copy (as filed) of such Tax Returns that are not Income Tax Returns to
the Parent for its review, accompanied by any reasonably requested explanation
and supporting computations, no later than fifteen (15) days after filing such
Tax Returns. In each case, the Acquiror and the Parent shall cooperate to
resolve any disagreements regarding the items on any such Tax Return no later
than twenty (20) days after Acquiror shall have delivered such Tax Return. If
the parties resolve all disagreements or have no disagreements, Parent shall
pay to the Acquiror the amount for which Parent is liable under _Section
7.03(a)_ of this Agreement with respect to such Tax Return,

 



      
 

 



 

in the case of an Income Tax Return, no later than five (5) Business Days
after the due date for filing such Income Tax Return, and in other cases, no
later than twenty-five (25) Business Days after receipt by the Parent of the
relevant Tax Return. If, however, the parties are unable to resolve all such
disagreements, any unresolved dispute shall be submitted to an Expert,
selected pursuant to the Expert Selection Process, and the Parent shall pay to
Acquiror (pursuant to the same schedule as set forth in the previous sentence)
the amount for which Parent is liable under _Section 7.03(a)_ of this
Agreement with respect to the relevant Tax Return if Parents position with
respect to the disputed item were adopted on such Tax Return. If the Expert
subsequently determines that the Acquirors position "is more likely than not
to be" the correct position under applicable Law, the Parent shall promptly
pay to the Acquiror an amount of cash equal to the disputed amount resolved in
the Acquirors favor. The Acquiror shall timely file, or cause to be timely
filed, each Tax Return described in this _Section 7.01(b)_ and shall timely
pay, or cause to be timely paid, all Taxes payable with respect to each such
Tax Return.

 



 

Section 7.02. _Tax Period Allocations_.

 



 

(a) For all purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to determine
the portion of any Taxes of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries that,
in the case of any Taxable period beginning on or before and ending after the
Closing Date, are allocated to the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date or the portion of such period beginning on the day after the
Closing Date, the determination shall be made, (i) in the case of any property
or other ad valorem Taxes which are imposed on a periodic basis, ratably on a
per diem basis, and (ii) in the case of any other Taxes, based on an interim
closing of the books of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the
end of the Closing Date (in the case of premium Tax credits, such credits are
to be apportioned on the same basis as the premium is allocated pursuant to
this sentence). All partnership items of Irving Partners Limited Partnership
allocable to the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary shall be apportioned
between the Taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing Date and
the Taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as if
the Company or the Transferred Subsidiary (as applicable) that holds an
interest in Irving Partners Limited Partnership had sold or exchanged its
entire interest in such entity on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 7.03. _Tax Indemnity_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing and subject to this _Article VII_, the Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified Parties (as
defined below) from and against, and reimburse any Acquiror Indemnified
Parties for, all Losses that any Acquiror Indemnified Party may at any time
suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of any Taxes (i) imposed on
or with respect to the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries with
respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period (including as a result of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election), (ii) of any Person (other than the Company or
any of the Transferred Subsidiaries) for which the Company or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries become liable (A) as a result of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or 1.1502-78 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law) as a result of a relationship or arrangement in existence at any
time prior to the Closing or (B) as a result of any event or transaction
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, as a transferee or successor, by
operation of Law, or by reason of a Contract that was entered into by the
Company or a Transferred Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date (other
than a

 



      
 

 



 

Contract that was entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business which does
not primarily relate to Taxes; _provided_ that Losses suffered as a result of
a Contract relating to the acquisition or disposition (including by way of
spin-off or split-off) of entities or substantially all of the assets of an
entity that includes an obligation to make payments in respect of Tax shall be
indemnifiable, or (iii) resulting from any breach by the Parent or any of its
Affiliates of any covenant in this _Article VII_.

 



 

(b) After the Closing and subject to this _Article VII_, the Acquiror shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties (as defined
below) from and against, and reimburse any Parent Indemnified Parties for, all
Losses that any Parent Indemnified Party may at any time suffer or incur, or
become subject to, as a result of any (i) Taxes imposed on or with respect to
the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to any Post-
Closing Taxable Period, (ii) Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or
any of the Transferred Subsidiaries) for which any Parent Indemnified Party
becomes liable (A) as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
1.1502-78 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) as a
result of a relationship or arrangement arising upon or after the Closing
between the Acquiror (or its Affiliates), the Company and/or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries or (B) as a result of any event or transaction
occurring after the Closing Date, as a transferee or successor because of a
relationship or arrangement between the Acquiror (or its Affiliates), the
Company and/or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, by operation of Law, or by
reason of a Contract that is entered into by the Company and/or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (other than a Contract that is
entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business which does not primarily
relate to Taxes; _provided_ that Losses suffered as a result of a Contract
relating to the acquisition or disposition (including by way of spin-off or
split-off) of entities or substantially all of the assets of an entity that
includes an obligation to make payments in respect of Tax shall be
indemnifiable), (iii) Taxes resulting from any breach by the Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates of any covenant in this _Article _VII or (iv) Subpart F
Hike Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 7.03(b)_, the Acquiror shall not indemnify, defend
or hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against, or reimburse
any Parent Indemnified Parties for, any Losses for which the Parent is
responsible under _Section 7.03(a)_ (but, for the avoidance of doubt, Subpart
F Hike Taxes are not Taxes for which the Parent is responsible pursuant to
Section 7.03(a) of this Agreement).

 



 

(c) If the Closing Date occurs after January 30, 2017, on March 1, 2018, the
Acquiror shall deliver to the Parent (i) a schedule setting forth the amounts
includible in income pursuant to Section 951(a)(1) of the Code for the taxable
year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to UG Asia (the " _2017 Subpart F
Schedule_ ") and (ii) a schedule setting forth the amounts includible in
income pursuant to Section 951(a)(1) of the Code for the portion of the 2017
taxable year ending on the Closing Date (assuming the taxable year of UG Asia
terminates on the Closing Date) (the " _2017 Stub Subpart F Schedule_ " and
together with the 2017 Subpart F Schedule, the " _Subpart F Schedules_ ", and
each, a " _Subpart F Schedule_ "). No later than March 30, 2018, the Parent
shall notify the Acquiror in writing of any objection the Parent may have to
the amounts shown therein, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such objection. The Parent and the Acquiror shall seek in good faith to
resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the Subpart F
Schedules. In the event that the Parent and the Acquiror are unable to reach a
mutual agreement on either or both Subpart F Schedules by April 15, 2018, the
Parent and the Acquiror shall appoint an Expert, selected pursuant to the
Expert Selection Process, to

 



      
 

 



 

determine the amounts and shall share its fees equally. The determination of
the Expert shall be binding on the Parent and the Acquiror. The " _Subpart F
Hike Taxes_ " shall be the greater of (i) zero and (ii) 35% of the excess of
(X) the amount shown as includible in income pursuant to Section 951(a)(1) of
the Code on the 2017 Subpart F Schedule multiplied by the ratio of (I) the
number of days in 2017 ending with and including the Closing Date to (II) 365
over (Y) the amount shown as includible in income pursuant to Section
951(a)(1) of the Code on the 2017 Stub Subpart F Schedule. If, as a result of
an IRS audit or administrative proceeding or a court proceeding occurring
after the Subpart F Schedules have been finalized, the amounts includible in
income shown on such schedules would, if such schedules reflected the outcome
of such audit or proceeding, differ from the amounts actually shown on such
schedules because of facts that were not taken into account in preparing such
schedules, such schedules shall be amended (using the same methodology and
analogous schedules as those outlined in the prior sentences of this _Section
7.03(c)_) and the amount of Subpart F Hike Taxes shall be recalculated, with
the Parent refunding to the Acquiror any decrease therein and the Acquiror
paying to the Parent any increase therein.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Acquiror
shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to any transfer, documentary, stamp or other similar Taxes that are
required to be filed and any recording or filing fees, including interest or
penalties thereon, in each case arising from the purchase and sale
contemplated pursuant to this Agreement (any such Taxes, fees, interest and
penalties, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). Any such Transfer Taxes, and the costs for
preparing and filing all such Tax Returns, shall be borne equally by the
Parent and the Acquiror. If required by applicable Law, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and other documentation. The Parent and the Acquiror shall reasonably
cooperate in obtaining any available exemptions from and minimizing any
applicable Transfer Taxes.

 



 

Section 7.04. _Tax Refunds_. The Parent or the Acquiror shall be entitled to
any refund of Taxes (whether in the form of cash received or a credit against
Taxes otherwise payable) for which it is responsible under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquiror shall be entitled to any refund of
any Tax of UG Asia that is attributable to any carryback from any Post-Closing
Taxable Period of UG Asia. The Person receiving such refund shall promptly
remit such refund to the Parent or the Acquiror, as applicable (or, if the
refund is in the form of a credit, the amount of such credit shall be paid to
the Parent or the Acquiror, as applicable, ten (10) days after the due date of
the Tax Return claiming such credit).

 



 

Section 7.05. _Post-Closing Acquiror Conduct_.

 



 

(a) Without the prior written consent of the Parent, which consent may be
withheld in the sole discretion of the Parent, none of the Acquiror or any
Affiliate of the Acquiror shall, or shall cause or permit the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary to, to the extent relating to the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Periods, (i)
amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or waive, or grant an extension of, any
statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return, (ii) self-assess a Tax,
(iii) engage in any voluntary disclosures or discussions with any Tax
Authority regarding any Tax or Tax Returns, (iv) file any private letter
ruling or similar request with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns, or (v) change
any election or other practice or procedure that could have an impact on Taxes
or Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Returns. Changes of "practice or procedure" for purposes of clause (v) of the
immediately preceding sentence shall not include any practice or procedure (1)
required by applicable Law or this Agreement, (2) to the extent consistent
with the past practice of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries, (3) to
the extent reflected on a Tax Return that is the subject of Section 7.01(b) or
(4) relating to a Tax Return that is filed after the Closing Date and that
reflects solely events, matters, and activities occurring or relevant after
the Closing Date and does not reflect any events, matters, or activities
occurring or relevant before the Closing Date. With respect to UG Asia, none
of the Acquiror or any Affiliate of the Acquiror shall, or shall cause or
permit the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary to, on or prior to December
31, 2016, (i) make any distribution (or take any other action that is treated
as a distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to shareholders in
excess of the amount of earnings and profits (as computed for United States
federal income tax purposes) derived during that portion of the taxable year
of UG Asia that includes the Closing that begins after the Closing, (ii) make
any investment in U.S. property within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code
at any time during the taxable year that includes the Closing Date, or (iii)
take any other action outside of the Ordinary Course of Business which would
reasonably be expected to impact the amount of Parents subpart F income
within the meaning of Section 952 of the Code.

 



 

(b) The Acquiror shall promptly cause the Company and each Transferred
Subsidiary to prepare and provide to the Parent a package of Tax information
materials (including schedules and work papers) (the " _Tax Package_ ")
required by the Parent to enable the Parent to prepare and file all Tax
Returns required to be prepared and filed by it hereunder. The Tax Package
shall be completed in accordance with past practice, including past practice
as to providing such information and as to the method of computation of
separate Taxable income or other relevant measure of income of the Company and
each Transferred Subsidiary. The Acquiror shall cause the Tax Package to be
delivered to the Parent within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 7.06. _Contest Provisions_. The Acquiror shall promptly notify the
Parent in writing upon receipt by the Acquiror, any of its Affiliates, the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary of notice of any pending or threatened
federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments which
might affect the Tax liabilities for which the Parent or any Affiliates of the
Parent on the Closing Date (other than the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary) may be liable; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to do so
shall not reduce the Parents liability under _Section 7.03_, except to the
extent such failure adversely impacts the Parents ability to defend the audit
or assessment. The Parent or its designee shall have the sole right to
represent the Companys and each Transferred Subsidiarys interests in any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date or otherwise relating to Taxes for which the
Parent (or any Affiliates of the Parent on the Closing Date other than the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary) may be liable, to settle such matters,
and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, except that Parent shall
not settle any such proceeding that would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the Acquiror, any of its Affiliates, the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary without the prior written consent of Acquiror (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the case of any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxable periods ending
after the Closing Date, subject to the subsequent clauses of this sentence,
the Acquiror shall have the right to represent the Companys and each
Transferred Subsidiarys interests in any such

 



      
 

 



 

audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to such Taxable periods,
but the Parent or its designee shall be entitled to participate at its expense
in any such audit or administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or
in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion of any such Taxable period
ending on and including the Closing Date and, with the written consent of the
Acquiror (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and at the
Parents or its designees sole expense, the Parent or its designee may assume
the control of such entire audit or proceeding, but, in such case, Parent
shall not settle any such audit or proceeding that would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the Acquiror, any of its Affiliates,
the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary without the prior written consent of
the Acquiror (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). None
of the Acquiror, any of its Affiliates, the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary may settle any Tax claim for any Taxes for which the Parent (or any
Affiliates of the Parent on the Closing Date other than the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary) may be liable, without the prior written consent of
the Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

Section 7.07. _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of
the Parent and the Acquiror shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to:

 



 

(a) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section 7.01_
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, by furnishing information to permit
the Parent to determine and report U.S. federal income tax items with respect
to UG Asia);

 



 

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with any Tax
Authority regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary;

 



 

(c) make available to the other and to any Tax Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes of the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary;

 



 

(d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits or assessments of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary for
Taxable periods for which the other may have a liability under _Section
7.03_; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to do so shall not reduce the
liability under _Section 7.03_, except to the extent such failure adversely
impacts the liable partys ability to defend the audit or assessment;

 



 

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any Tax
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect
to any Taxable period for which the other may have a liability under _Section
7.03_;

 



 

(f) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in _Section
7.03(d)_ (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and

 



 

(g) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this _Article VII_;

 



       
 

 



 

 _provided_ that neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates (nor their
respective Representatives) shall be required to disclose to the Acquiror or
any of its agents or Representatives any consolidated, combined, affiliated or
unitary Tax Return which includes the Parent or any of its Affiliates or any
Tax-related work papers, except, in each case, for materials or portions
thereof that relate solely to the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries. If reasonably requested by the Parent, the Acquiror shall enter
into a customary joint defense agreement with any one or more of the Parent,
any Affiliate of the Parent, the Company and each of the Transferred
Subsidiaries with respect to any information to be provided to the Acquiror
pursuant to this _Section 7.07_ for the purpose of, _inter alia_ , preserving
privilege.

 



 

Section 7.08. _Other Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
indemnification provided for in this _Article VII_ shall be the sole remedy
for any claim in respect of Taxes for which an indemnity is provided under
_Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(b)_ (including those Taxes that would
otherwise (that is, but for the exception set forth in the parenthetical in
_Section 10.02(a)_) also be the subject of indemnification pursuant to
_Article X_ by being Taxes arising as a result of, or in connection with, the
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the Parent in
_Section 3.21_), and the provisions of _Article X_ shall not apply to such
claims, except for _Section 10.01_ (subject to _Section 7.08(c)_), _Section
10.05_, _Section 10.06_ and _Section 10.07_ (other than clause (iv)
thereof).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, where, as a
result of any Taxes, the payment of an amount in respect of an indemnity under
this _Article VII_ or _Article X_ directly to an Acquiror Indemnified Party
imposes a greater burden on the Parent than the payment of such amount
directly to the Company, the Parent shall have the option to pay that amount
directly to the Company, _provided_ , that the Acquiror Indemnified Parties
are fully indemnified in the aggregate.

 



 

(c) Any claim for indemnity under this _Article VII_ may be made at any time
through the sixtieth (60th) day after the expiration of the applicable Tax
statute of limitations with respect to the relevant Taxable period (including
all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive) and may be made
only if the Indemnifying Party has been timely notified of the Tax audit or
assessment in a way that would allow it to contest the relevant Tax liability.

 



 

(d) (i) The Parent and the Acquiror shall make, or shall cause to be made, an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any similar state or local
laws with respect to the Company and each Transferred Subsidiary that is
taxable as a domestic corporation under the Code (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_"). The Parent and the Acquiror shall report and treat,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to report and treat, the sale and
purchase (or deemed sale and purchase) of the Shares as a sale of the assets
and liabilities of each such corporation, and the parties hereto shall report,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to report, such transactions and
deemed transactions in accordance with the Section 338(h)(10) Election. The
Acquiror agrees and covenants that (other than as set forth above) none of the
Acquiror or any Affiliate of the Acquiror will make any election under Section
338 of the Code (or other similar state, local or foreign tax Law) with
respect to the acquisition of the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries. The Parent and the Acquiror agree and covenant that they

 



      
 

 



 

will duly execute, or cause to be executed, any form (including IRS Form 8023)
required for purposes of making the Section 338(h)(10) Election and such forms
shall be delivered to each party at or prior to the Closing Date. The Parent
and the Acquiror agree and covenant that they will not, and they will cause
their respective Affiliates not to, make any election under Section 338 of the
Code or other similar state, local or foreign tax Law that is inconsistent
with the Section 338(h)(10) Election or file any Tax Return (or take any other
Tax position) with respect to the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries that is inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election (unless
otherwise required by Law).

 



 

(ii) Within eighty (80) days following the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall
prepare and deliver to the Parent a schedule allocating the aggregate deemed
sale price, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4 (or, if
different, the sales price that is required to be used for purposes of any
state, local or foreign Law), for the Company and each Transferred Subsidiary
for which a Section 338 election (or a similar election under state, local or
foreign tax Law) will be made, among the assets of the Company and each
Transferred Subsidiary (the " _Section 338 Allocation Schedule_"). The
Section 338 Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with Section
338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and, if
applicable, in accordance with any other similar provision of state, local and
foreign Law). Within thirty (30) days of receiving the Section 338 Allocation
Schedule from the Acquiror, the Parent shall notify the Acquiror in writing of
any objection it may have to the allocations contained therein, setting forth
in reasonable detail the basis for such objection. The Parent and the Acquiror
shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with
respect to the Section 338 Allocation Schedule delivered by the Acquiror. In
the event that the Parent and the Acquiror are unable to reach a mutual
agreement on the Section 338 Allocation Schedule within fifteen (15) days of
the Parent having given notice of its objection to the allocations contained
therein, the Parent and the Acquiror shall appoint an Expert, selected
pursuant to the Expert Selection Process, to determine the allocation and
shall share its fees equally. The determination of the Expert shall be binding
on the Parent and the Acquiror. Each of the Parent and the Acquiror agrees
that promptly upon agreeing on the Section 338 Allocation Schedule (or the
determination of the Expert) it shall return an executed copy thereof to the
other party hereto. The Parent and the Acquiror shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, file all federal, state, local and foreign Tax
Returns in accordance with the Section 338 Allocation Schedule, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, except with respect to any of the following agreements to
which the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries are the only parties
thereto, the Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such
actions as may be necessary to terminate, concurrently with the end of the
Closing Date, all contracts and agreements between the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Parent or any Affiliate of
the Parent (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, relating to Tax allocation, sharing or paying agreements (the "
_Tax Sharing Agreements_ "), so as to cause there to be no continuing
liability thereunder on this part of the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary. Subject to _Section 2.09_ and _Section 5.01(i)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, after the date hereof, no payment shall be made by the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary pursuant to any Tax Sharing Agreement
and neither the Company nor any Transferred Subsidiary shall be entitled to
any payment under any Tax Sharing Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if an indemnifying party
has indemnified the other party for any amount of Taxes pursuant to this
_Article VII_ and such latter party fails to discharge the Tax liability
giving rise to such indemnity, then, if any Governmental Authority attempts to
collect such Taxes or any portion thereof from the former indemnifying party,
such latter party shall reimburse such former indemnifying party for any
Losses resulting therefrom.

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Parent and the Acquiror;

 



 

(b) by either the Parent or the Acquiror if the Closing has not occurred on or
before the Initial Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the sole
reason that the Closing has not occurred is that either (x) one or more of the
approvals or non-disapprovals of the Governmental

 



      
 

 



 

Authorities required pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_ have not been obtained or
(y) the closing condition set forth in _Section 8.01(c)_ has not been
satisfied, in each case, on or prior to such date, such date may be extended
by either party hereto to a date not beyond three (3) months following the
Initial Outside Date (the Initial Outside Date, as extended pursuant to this
_Section 9.01(b)_, herein referred to as the " _Outside Date_ "); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.01(b)_ and the right to extend the Initial Outside Date shall not
be available to any party hereto whose failure to take any action required to
fulfill any of such partys obligations under this Agreement has caused or
resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such date;

 



 

(c) by either the Parent or the Acquiror in the event of (i) the issuance of a
final, non-appealable Governmental Order restraining or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) that
any Law has been enacted, promulgated or issued, or deemed applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by any Governmental Authority
that restrains, enjoins or prohibits the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or that would make the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby illegal;

 



 

(d) by the Acquiror (but only so long as the Acquiror is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Parent
such that one or more of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
8.01_ and _Section 8.03_ are not capable of being fulfilled prior to the
Outside Date or if such breach is capable of being cured prior to the Outside
Date but is not so cured within 60 days following the Acquiror providing
written notice of such breach to the Parent; or

 



 

(e) by the Parent (but only so long as the Parent is not in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Acquiror such that
one or more of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.01_ and
_Section 8.02_ are not capable of being fulfilled prior to the Outside Date
or if such breach is capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date but is
not so cured within 60 days following the Parent providing written notice of
such breach to the Acquiror;

 



 

Section 9.02. _Notice of Termination_. Any party hereto desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party hereto.

 



 

Section 9.03. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
9.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability on the part of any party hereto or any Financing Source Related
Party, except, in the case of any party hereto, as set forth in _Section
5.05_, this _Article IX_ and _Article XI_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party hereto from liability for
(i) failure to perform in any material respect the obligations set forth in
_Section 5.06_ or (ii) any fraud or knowing and intentional material breach
of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement (i) by either party
pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_ at a time when one or more of the approvals of
the Governmental Authorities required pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_ have not
been obtained and at the time of such termination all of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.01(a)_, _Section 8.01(c)_, _Section 8.03(a)_, _Section
8.03(c)_ and the second sentence of _Section 8.03(d)_ have been satisfied or
waived (or, in the case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of
such termination) other than any condition with respect to the approvals of
the Governmental Authorities required pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_ or (ii)
by either party pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_ and at the time of such
termination all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_, _Section
8.01(c)_, _Section 8.03(a)_, _Section 8.03(c)_ and the second sentence of
_Section 8.03(d)_ have been satisfied or waived (or, in the case of
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, would be
satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of such termination), then
the Acquiror shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Termination Fee to the Parent
as promptly as reasonably possible (and in any event, within ten (10) Business
Days following such termination). It being understood that in no event shall
Acquiror be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Parents right to receive payment of the Termination Fee
from the Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 9.03(b)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parent or any of its Affiliates against (x) Acquiror
or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, partners,
members or Representatives for any and all Losses that may be suffered based
upon, resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to such
termination (except for any fraud or knowing and intentional material breach
of this Agreement) and (y) the Financing Source Related Parties for any and
all Losses that may be suffered based upon, resulting from or arising out of
the circumstances giving rise to such termination.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parent and the Acquiror acknowledge that the agreement
contained in _Section 9.03(b)_ is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without this agreement, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Acquiror fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 9.03(b)_, and, in order
to obtain such payment, the Parent commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the Acquiror for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof,
the Acquiror shall pay the costs and expenses of the Parent (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if the Acquiror fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this
_Section 9.03(c)_, then the Acquiror shall pay interest on such overdue
amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount
is actually paid in full) at a rate equal to the prime rate as reported in The
Wall Street Journal.

 



 

(d) Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and
without in any way increasing the amount of the Termination Fee or expanding
the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed
that the Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and the
payment of the Termination Fee in the circumstances specified herein is
supported by due and sufficient consideration. While Parent may pursue both a
grant of specific performance under _Section 11.13_ and the payment of the
Termination Fee under this _Article IX_, under no circumstances shall Parent,
prior to the Closing,

 



      
 

 



 

be entitled to receive both (x) a grant of specific performance which results
in consummation of the Closing and (y) all or any portion of the Termination
Fee.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Termination Fee shall
not be due and payable to Parent if this Agreement is terminated at a time
when the condition set forth in _Section 8.01(c)_ has not been satisfied.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 10.01. _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the parties
hereto contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate

(a) After the Closing and subject to this _Article X_, the Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Acquiror, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Acquiror Indemnified Parties_
") against, and reimburse any Acquiror Indemnified Party for, all Losses
(other than Losses that are Taxes that are (i) the subject of indemnification
under _Section 7.03(a)_ or (ii) Taxes arising as a result of, or in
connection with, the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Parent in _Section 3.21_ with respect to any Post-Closing Taxable
Periods) that such Acquiror Indemnified Party may at any time suffer or incur,
or become subject to as a result of or in connection with:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the

of the inaccuracy or breach of any Parent Fundamental Representations) (i)
with respect to any claim (or series of claims arising from substantially
similar underlying facts, events or circumstances) unless such claim (or
series of claims arising from substantially similar underlying facts, events
or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $200,000 (nor shall any such
claim or series of claims that do not meet the

 



      
 

 



 

$200,000 threshold be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the
aggregate amount of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties Losses for which the
Parent has responsibility under clause (ii) of this _Section 10.02(b)_
below); (ii) until the aggregate amount of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties
Losses for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties are finally determined to be
otherwise entitled to indemnification under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ exceeds
$17,000,000, after which the Parent shall be obligated for all Acquiror
Indemnified Parties Losses for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties are
finally determined to be otherwise entitled to indemnification under _Section
10.02(a)(i)_ that are in excess of $17,000,000, but only if such excess Losses
arise with respect to any claim (or series of related claims arising from
substantially similar underlying facts, events or circumstances) that involves
Losses in excess of $200,000; and (iii) in a cumulative aggregate amount
exceeding $510,000,000. For purposes of determining whether the threshold set
forth in clause (iii) of this _Section 10.02(b)_ has been met or exceeded,
any amount paid by the Parent for Losses pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(i)_,
other than any Losses in respect of the inaccuracy or breach of any Parent
Fundamental Representations, shall be taken into account. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parent shall not be required to
indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Acquiror Indemnified Party against, or
reimburse any Acquiror Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant to _Section
10.02(a)(i)_ in a cumulative aggregate amount exceeding the Purchase Price.

(a) After the Closing and subject to this _Article X_, the Acquiror shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_
") against, and reimburse any Parent Indemnified Party for, all Losses that
such Parent Indemnified Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become
subject to:

 



 

(i) as a result of or in connection with the inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Acquiror in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) as a result of or in connection with any breach or failure by the
Acquiror to perform any of its covenants, obligations or agreements contained
in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Acquiror
shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Parent
Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any Parent Indemnified Party for, any
Losses pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)(i)_ (other than Losses arising out of
the inaccuracy or breach of any Acquiror Fundamental Representations) (i) with
respect to any claim (or series of claims arising from substantially similar
underlying facts, events or circumstances) unless such claim (or series of
claims arising from substantially similar underlying facts, events or
circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $200,000 (nor shall any such claim
or series of claims that do not meet the $200,000 threshold be applied to or
considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of the Parent
Indemnified Parties Losses for which the Acquiror has responsibility under
clause (ii) of this _Section 10.03(b)_ below); (ii) until the aggregate
amount of the Parent Indemnified Parties Losses for which the Parent
Indemnified Parties are finally determined to be otherwise entitled to
indemnification under _Section 10.03(a)(i)_ exceeds $17,000,000, after which

 



       
 

 



 

the Acquiror shall be obligated for all Parent Indemnified Parties Losses for
which the Parent Indemnified Parties are finally determined to be otherwise
entitled to indemnification under _Section 10.03(a)(i)_ that are in excess of
$17,000,000, but only if such excess Losses arise with respect to any claim
(or series of related claims arising from substantially similar underlying
facts, events or circumstances) that involves Losses in excess of $200,000;
and (iii) in a cumulative aggregate amount exceeding $510,000,000. For
purposes of determining whether the threshold set forth in clause (iii) of
this _Section 10.03(b)_ has been met or exceeded, any amount paid by the
Acquiror for Losses pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)(i)_, other than any Losses
in respect of the inaccuracy or breach of any Acquiror Fundamental
Representations, shall be taken into account. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Acquiror shall not be required to indemnify,
defend or hold harmless any Parent Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any
Parent Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)(i)_ in
a cumulative aggregate amount exceeding the Purchase Price.

 



 

Section 10.04. _Notification of Claims_.

 



 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any claim in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this _Article X_, including
any pending or threatened claim, demand, notice or other communication by a
third party (including any Governmental Authority) that the Indemnified Party
has determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim,
demand, notice or other communication asserted by a third party against the
Indemnified Party) (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such
claim or demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such
notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _Article X_ except to the extent that such failure actually
prejudices the defense of such claim by the Indemnifying Party. Any
indemnifiable claim that is not a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by
written notice to the Indemnifying Party. The parties agree that (i) in this
_Article X_ they intend to shorten (in the case of the limited survival
periods specified in _Section 10.01_) and lengthen (in the case of the
indefinite survival periods specified in _Section 10.01_) (as the case may
be) the applicable statute of limitations period with respect to certain
claims; (ii) notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation or
warranty must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in _Section 10.01_ for such representation or warranty; and
(iii) any claims for indemnification for which notice is not timely delivered
in accordance with this _Section 10.04(a)_ shall be expressly barred and are
hereby waived; _provided_ , _further_ , that if, prior to such applicable
date, a party hereto shall have notified the other party hereto in accordance
with the requirements of this _Section 10.04(a)_ of a claim for
indemnification under this _Article X_ (whether or not formal legal Action
shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such claim shall continue to
be subject to indemnification in accordance with this _Article X_
notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 10.04(a)_ in respect of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within
twenty (20) Business Days of the

 



      
 

 



 

receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, elect to compromise, settle,
defend or appeal such Third Party Claim, with its own counsel, contractors and
consultants and at its own expense and the Indemnified Party shall, and the
Parent, on the one hand, or the Acquiror, on the other hand (as the case may
be), shall cause each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives to,
cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party in the compromise, settlement or
appeal of, or defense against, such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes the compromise, defense, appeal or settlement of
such Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse
the Indemnified Party for reasonable third party out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party (such as reasonable travel costs, but not
internal time charges) in providing its cooperation and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to employ one counsel to represent itself if an actual
conflict of interest exists in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in
respect of such Third Party Claim and in that event the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel shall promptly be paid by the Indemnifying Party (it
being understood that all Indemnified Parties may employ not more than one
counsel to represent them at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The
Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such
Third Party Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from the
Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence. In
the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the compromise,
settlement or appeal of, or defense against, such Third Party Claim within 20
Business Days after receipt of notice thereof from the Indemnified Party, such
Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the compromise, settlement
or appeal of, or defense against, such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for
the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably apprised of
any significant developments relating to such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any claim or demand for which it is seeking
indemnification from the Indemnifying Party or admit to any liability with
respect to such claim or demand without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned). If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the compromise,
settlement or appeal of, or defense against, a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, unless such
settlement, compromise, discharge or entry of any judgment does not involve
any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, and such settlement, compromise,
discharge or judgment involves only the payment of money damages, and the
Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out
of such settlement, compromise, discharge or judgment concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement, compromise, discharge or judgment (unless
otherwise provided in such settlement, compromise, discharge or judgment) and
(ii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement, compromise, discharge, entry of
judgment (if applicable), or other resolution, a complete and unconditional
general release of each Indemnified Party from any and all liabilities in
respect of such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article X_
(including _Section 10.02_ and _Section 10.03_), no Indemnifying Party shall
have any liability under this _Article X_ for any Losses arising out of or in
connection with any Third Party Claim

 



      
 

 



 

that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified Party without the consent of
such Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.04(a)_ that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days following its receipt of
such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _Article X_. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any such claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the case of any Action by a
Governmental Authority against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise, or settle such Third Party Claim and any fees of counsel
or other expenses or any Losses shall be the responsibility of the
Indemnifying Party, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any
compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

Section 10.05. _Payment_. In the event a claim or any Action for
indemnification under _Article VII_ and this _Article X_ has been finally
determined, the amount of such final determination shall be paid (a) if the
Indemnified Party is an Acquiror Indemnified Party, by the Parent to the
Indemnified Party and (b) if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified
Party, by the Acquiror to the Indemnified Party, in each case on demand in
immediately available funds. A claim or an Action, and the liability for and
amount of damages therefor, shall be deemed to be " _finally determined_ " for
purposes of this _Article X_ or _Article VII_ (as the case may be) when the
parties hereto have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a
final non-appealable Governmental Order has been entered into with respect to
such claim or Action.

 



 

Section 10.06. _Exclusive Remedies_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees
that, following the Closing, except in cases of fraud or intentional breach
and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the indemnification
provisions of this _Article X_ and, with respect to Tax matters, _Article
VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedies of the parties in
connection with any breach of a representation and warranty, or non-
performance, partial or total, of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any claims based upon
fraud be subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in _Article
VII or _this _Article X_.

 



 

Section 10.07. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 



 

(a) The Parent and the Acquiror agree, for themselves and on behalf of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each
indemnification obligation set forth in _Article VII_ and this _Article X_,
any Transaction Agreement or any other document executed or delivered in
connection with the Closing: (i) solely in the case of any indemnification
with respect to UG Asia, each such obligation shall be calculated on an After-
Tax Basis, (ii) all Losses shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds,
(iii) in no event shall an Indemnifying Party have any liability to an
Indemnified Party for: (A) any punitive or special

 



      
 

 



 

damages other than punitive or special damages recovered by third parties in
connection with a Third Party Claim, (B) any damages solely attributable to
lost profits to the extent constituting damages in excess of the difference
between the value of what the Indemnified Party received in the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and the value of what the Indemnified Party
should have received in the transaction contemplated by the Agreement if there
had been no breach of the representation and warranty or covenant by the
Indemnifying Party for which breach the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification and (C) any Losses to the extent incurred in connection with a
partys assertion, enforcement, dispute or resolution of its indemnification
or other rights under this Agreement or the collection of any amounts payable
to a party hereto under this Agreement, unless such Losses are finally
determined to be indemnifiable, (iv) in no event shall the Parent have any
liability or obligation to any Acquiror Indemnified Party to the extent that
any Loss, or any portion thereof, for which indemnification is sought
hereunder is reserved for in the Reference Balance Sheet (but such limitation
shall only apply up to the amount so reserved) and (v) notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of this
_Article X_, (A) a breach of a representation or warranty shall be deemed to
exist either if such representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or
breached or would have been inaccurate or breached if such representation or
warranty had not contained any qualification as to materiality, or Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect (which, in each
case, instead will be read as any adverse effect or change) or similar
language, except for the reference to material in _Section 3.08(a)(i)_,
Section 3.10(a), the second and third sentences of _Section 3.10(b)_,
_Section 3.14(a)_ and _Section 3.23(a)_, which shall not be read out for
such purpose, and (B) the amount of Losses in respect of any breach of a
representation or warranty, including any deemed breach resulting from the
application of clause (A), shall be determined without regard to any
limitation or qualification as to materiality, or Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect (which, in each case, instead will
be read as any adverse effect or change) or similar language set forth in such
representation or warranty, except for the reference to material in _Section
3.08(a)(i)_, Section 3.10(a), the second and third sentences of _Section
3.10(b)_, _Section 3.14(a)_ and _Section 3.23(a)_, which shall not be read
out for such purpose.

 



 

(b) Any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Article _VII or
this _Article X_ shall be paid promptly and without reduction and payment
shall not be delayed pending any determination of Eligible Insurance Proceeds.
In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any
Eligible Insurance Proceeds or any other amount in respect of any Loss for
which an Indemnifying Party has actually reimbursed it pursuant to _Article
VII_ or this _Article X_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to
the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Eligible Insurance Proceeds, but not
in excess of any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price (including for all applicable
Income Tax purposes).

 



 

(d) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party may be
covered, in whole or in part, by third party insurance coverage, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party
(a " _Notice of Insurance_ "). If the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party so requests within one hundred and eighty (180) days after
receipt of a Notice of Insurance, the Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to collect insurance proceeds
thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party has no
obligation to commence, or threaten or otherwise seek to commence, any Action
against any Person, including any Governmental Authority, to collect insurance
proceeds under such third party insurance coverage.

This INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT, dated as of , (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made between Arch Capital Group Ltd., an exempted company
with limited liability registered under the laws of Bermuda (together with its
successors and permitted assigns, the " _Company_ "), and American
International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_ ").

 



 

A. On August 15, 2016 (the " _Signing Date_ "), the Company and the Parent
entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of the Signing Date (the "
_Stock Purchase Agreement_ "), providing for, among other things, the issuance
to the Parent of certain securities of the Company.

 



 

B. On the date hereof, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Parent
acquired from the Company (i) shares of Company Convertible
Preferred Stock convertible into shares of Company Common Stock
(such Company Convertible Preferred Stock, together with such Company Common
Stock issuable by way of conversion thereof, the " _Convertible Preferred
Shares_ ") and (ii) shares of Company Perpetual Preferred Stock (the
" _Perpetual Preferred Shares_ ").

 



 

C. The Company and the Parent desire to establish in this Agreement certain
terms and conditions concerning the Parents and other Investors
relationships with and investments in the Company, including the registration
rights for Registrable Securities set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

D. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in _Section
4.16_.

 



 

Now, therefore, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

 



 

1.1 _Shelf Registrations_.

 



 

(a) _Shelf Registration of Perpetual Preferred Shares_. On the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 or the then-appropriate form for an offering to be made
on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act
or any successor rule thereto (or amend an existing Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement or file a prospectus supplement that shall be deemed to
be part of an existing Automatic Shelf Registration Statement in accordance
with Rule 430B under the Securities Act) (a " _Shelf Registration Statement_
") covering all Registrable Securities that are Perpetual Preferred Shares
held by the Investors pursuant to a shelf registration for an offering to be
made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act or any successor rule thereto (a " _Shelf Registration_ "). If
permitted under the Securities Act, such Shelf Registration Statement shall be
an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act. The Shelf Registration shall provide for the resale of such
Registrable Securities from time to time by and pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to the Investors (including, without
limitation, an underwritten offering, a direct sale to purchasers, a sale to
or through brokers, dealers or agents, a sale over the

      
 

 



 

internet, block trades, derivative transactions with third parties, sales in
connection with short sales and other hedging transactions). The Company shall
comply with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act with respect to
the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf
Registration Statement in accordance with the intended methods of disposition
by the Parent and the other Investors thereof.

 



 

(b) _Shelf Registration of Other Shares_. No later than the date that is ten
(10) days, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement that is an Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement, or sixty (60) days, in the case of a Shelf
Registration Statement other than an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement,
prior to the Six-Month Restricted Date, the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC a Shelf Registration Statement covering all Registrable
Securities other than Perpetual Preferred Shares held by the Investors
pursuant to a Shelf Registration. If permitted under the Securities Act, such
Shelf Registration Statement shall be an "automatic shelf registration
statement" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. The Shelf
Registration shall provide for the resale of such Registrable Securities from
time to time by and pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally
available to the Investors (including, without limitation, an underwritten
offering, a direct sale to purchasers, a sale to or through brokers, dealers
or agents, a sale over the internet, block trades, derivative transactions
with third parties, sales in connection with short sales and other hedging
transactions). The Company shall comply with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities
covered by such Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition by the Parent and the other Investors thereof.

 



 

(c) _Effectiveness_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause the Shelf Registration Statements filed pursuant to _Section 1.1(a)_
and _Section 1.1(b)_ to be declared effective by the SEC or otherwise become
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the filing
thereof and (ii) keep such Shelf Registration Statements continuously
effective and in compliance with the Securities Act and useable for the resale
of Registrable Securities covered by each such Shelf Registration Statement
until such time as there are no Registrable Securities remaining, including by
filing successive replacement or renewal Shelf Registration Statements upon
the expiration of such Shelf Registration Statements.

 



 

(d) _Additional Selling Stockholders_. At any time and from time to time when
a Shelf Registration Statement is effective, if the Parent or any other
Investor requests that the Parent or any other Investor be added as a selling
stockholder in such Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall as
promptly as practicable amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement
to cover such additional Investor.

 



 

(e) _Right to Effect Shelf Take-Down_. The Parent and each other Investor
shall be entitled, at any time and from time to time when a Shelf Registration
Statement is effective, to sell any or all of the Registrable Securities
covered by such Shelf Registration Statement (a " _Shelf Take-Down_ ").

 



 

(f) _Underwritten Shelf Take-Downs_. The Parent or any other Investor
intending to effect a Shelf Take-Down shall be entitled to request, by written
notice to the Company (an " _Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice_ "), that the
Shelf Take-Down be an underwritten offering (an " _Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down_ "). The Underwritten Shelf Take-

 



      
 

 



 

Down Notice shall specify the number of Registrable Securities intended to be
offered and sold by the Parent and/or other Investor(s) pursuant to the
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down. The Company shall amend or supplement the Shelf
Registration as may be necessary in order to enable such Registrable
Securities to be distributed pursuant to the Underwritten Shelf Take-Down. The
Company will pay all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any
registration or underwritten offering requested in accordance with this
Agreement. The Company shall not be required to facilitate an Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down unless the aggregate gross proceeds from such offering are
reasonably expected to be at least two-hundred million dollars ($200 million)
and shall not be required to effect more than two (2) Underwritten Shelf Take-
Downs in any twelve (12) month period.

 



 

(g) _Selection of Underwriters_. In connection with any such underwritten
offering, the Parent or any other Investor requesting such underwritten
offering shall have the right to select the investment banking firm(s) and
manager(s) to administer such underwritten offering as lead bookrunning
managing underwriter(s), subject to the approval of the Company (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For such
underwritten offering, the Company will have the right to appoint one co-lead
manager that shall not serve in the capacity as a bookrunning underwriter.

 



 

(h) _Non-Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_. If the Parent or any other Investor
desires to initiate an offering or sale of all or part of the Parents or any
other Investors Registrable Securities that does not constitute an
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (a " _Non-Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ "), the
Parent or such other Investor shall so indicate in a written notice (a " _Non-
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice_ ") delivered to the Company no later than
three (3) Business Days (or in the event any amendment or supplement to a
Shelf Registration Statement is necessary, no later than ten (10) Business
Days) prior to the expected date of such Non-Underwritten Shelf Take-Down,
which request shall include (i) the total number of Registrable Securities
expected to be offered and sold in such Non-Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, (ii)
the expected plan of distribution of such Non-Underwritten Shelf Take-Down and
(iii) the action or actions required (including the timing thereof) in
connection with such Non-Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (including the delivery
of one or more stock certificates representing Registrable Securities to be
sold in such Non-Underwritten Shelf Take-Down), and, to the extent necessary,
the Company shall file and effect an amendment or supplement to its applicable
Shelf Registration Statement for such purpose as soon as practicable after
receipt of such Non-Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice.

 



 

1.2 _Demand Registrations_.

 



 

(a) _Right to Demand Registrations_. If the Company has not made available a
Shelf Registration, on or after the date of this Agreement, in the case of
Demand Registrations covering Registrable Securities that are Perpetual
Preferred Shares, or on or after the date that is sixty (60) days prior to the
Six-Month Restricted Date, in the case of Demand Registrations covering
Registrable Securities other than Perpetual Preferred Shares, the Parent or
any other Investor may, by providing written notice to the Company, request to
sell all or a portion of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration
Statement separate from a Shelf Registration Statement (a " _Demand
Registration_ "). Each request for a Demand Registration (a " _Demand
Registration Request_ ") shall specify the number of Registrable Securities
intended to be offered and sold by the Parent and any other Investors pursuant
to the Demand Registration and the

 



      
 

 



 

intended method of distribution thereof, including whether it is intended to
be an underwritten offering. As promptly as practicable and no later than ten
(10) Business Days after receipt of a Demand Registration Request, the Company
shall register all Registrable Securities that have been requested to be
registered in the Demand Registration Request. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this _Section 1.2(a)_ to be declared effective by the SEC or otherwise become
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the filing thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Registration Statement
covering Registrable Securities other than Perpetual Preferred Shares filed
pursuant to this _Section 1.2(a)_ need not be declared effective prior to the
Six-Month Restricted Date. A Demand Registration shall be effected by way of a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 or any similar short-form registration
statement to the extent the Company is permitted to use such form at such
time, and may be effected through an existing registration statement that is
already effective under the Securities Act, or through a post-effective
amendment or supplement to any such Registration Statement or other
registration statement.

 



 

(b) _Number of Demand Registrations_. The Parent and the other Investors shall
be collectively entitled to request up to a total of three (3) Demand
Registrations covering Registrable Securities other than Perpetual Preferred
Shares (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be in addition to any Shelf
Registration pursuant to _Section 1.1_); _provided_ , _however_ , that a
registration shall not count as a Demand Registration for this purpose unless
and until the Parent and the other Investors are able to register and sell at
least 75% of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to comply
with a Demand Registration unless the aggregate gross proceeds from such
offering are reasonably expected to be at least two-hundred million dollars
($200 million).

 



 

(c) _Withdrawal_. An Investor may, by written notice to the Company, withdraw
its Registrable Securities from a Demand Registration at any time prior to the
effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement. Upon receipt of
notices from all applicable Investors to such effect, the Company shall cease
all efforts to seek effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement,
unless the Company intends to effect a primary offering of securities pursuant
to such Registration Statement.

 



 

(d) _Selection of Underwriters_. If a Demand Registration is an underwritten
offering, the Parent or any other Investor requesting such underwritten
offering shall have the right to select the investment banking firm(s) and
manager(s) to administer such underwritten offering as lead bookrunning
managing underwriter(s), subject to the approval of the Company (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For such
underwritten offering, the Company will have the right to appoint one co-lead
manager that shall not serve in the capacity as a bookrunning underwriter.

 



 

1.3 _Inclusion of Other Securities; Priority_. The Company shall not include
in any Demand Registration or Shelf Take-Down any securities that are not
Registrable Securities without the prior written consent of the Investors
participating in such Demand Registration or Shelf Take-Down (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If a Demand Registration
or Shelf Take-Down involves an underwritten offering and the managing
underwriters of such offering advise the Company and the Investors in writing
that, in their opinion, the number of Equity Securities proposed to be
included in such Demand Registration or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down,
including all Registrable Securities and all other Equity

 



      
 

 



 

Securities proposed to be included in such offering, exceeds the number of
Equity Securities that can reasonably be expected to be sold in such offering
without adversely affecting the success of the offering (including the price,
timing or distribution of the securities to be sold in such offering), the
Company shall include in such Demand Registration or Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down: (i) _first_ , the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by
Investors in such offering; and (ii) _second_ , any Equity Securities
proposed to be included therein by any other Persons (including Equity
Securities to be sold for the account of the Company and/or any other holders
of Equity Securities), allocated, in the case of this _clause (ii)_ , among
such Persons in such manner as the Company may determine. If more than one
Investor is participating in such Demand Registration or Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down and the managing underwriters of such offering determine that a
limited number of Registrable Securities may be included in such offering
without reasonably being expected to adversely affect the success of the
offering (including the price, timing or distribution of the securities to be
sold in such offering), then the Registrable Securities that are included in
such offering shall be allocated _pro rata_ among the participating Investors
on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities initially requested to be
sold by each such Investor in such offering.

 



 

1.4 _Restrictions on Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Right to Defer or Suspend Registration_. In the event that the Company
determines in good faith that any one or more of the following circumstances
exist, the Company may, at its option, (x) defer, suspend or delay any Demand
Registration or (y) require the Parent and the other Investors to suspend any
offerings of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement for
the periods specified:

 



 

(i) if the Company is subject to any of its customary suspension or blackout
periods, for all or part of such period;

 



 

(ii) if the Company believes after consultation with counsel that an offering
would require the Company, under applicable securities laws and other laws, to
make disclosures of material non-public information that would not otherwise
be required to be disclosed at that time and the Company believes in good
faith that such disclosures at that time would have a material and adverse
effect on the Company; _provided_ , that this exception shall continue to
apply only during the time that such material non-public information has not
been disclosed and remains material; _provided_ , _further_ , that upon
disclosure of such material non-public information, the Company shall (x)
notify the Parent and the other Investors whose Registrable Securities are
included in the Registration Statement; (y) terminate any deferment or
suspension it has put into effect; and (z) take such actions necessary to
permit registered sales of Registrable Securities as required or contemplated
by this Agreement, including, if necessary, preparation and filing of a post-
effective amendment or prospectus supplement so that the Registration
Statement and any prospectus forming a part thereof will not include an untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading; and

 



 

(iii) if any such offering would violate applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Limitation on Deferrals and Suspensions_. The Company shall not be
permitted to defer registration or require the Parent and the other Investors
to suspend an offering pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)(ii)_ if the duration of
all such deferrals or suspensions would for any individual reason exceed sixty
(60) consecutive days or if the duration of all such deferrals or suspensions
would in the aggregate exceed one hundred twenty (120) days in any twelve (12)
month period.

 



 

(c) _Withdrawal_. If the Company delays or suspends a Demand Registration, the
Investor that initiated such Demand Registration shall be entitled to withdraw
its Demand Registration Request and, if it does so, such Demand Registration
Request shall not count against the limitation on the number of such Holders
Demand Registrations set forth in _Section 1.2(b)_.

 



 

1.5 _Piggyback Registrations_.

 



 

(a) _Right to Piggyback_. Whenever the Company proposes to register any Equity
Securities under the Securities Act (other than a registration (i) pursuant to
a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or other registration solely relating to
an offering or sale to employees or directors of the Company pursuant to any
employee share plan or other employee benefit arrangement), (ii) pursuant to a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 (or similar form that relates to a
transaction subject to Rule 145 under the Securities Act or any successor rule
thereto), (iii) in connection with any dividend or distribution reinvestment
or similar plan or (iv) pursuant to a registration in which the Company is
offering to exchange its own securities for other securities), whether for its
own account or for the account of one or more stockholders of the Company
(other than the Investors) (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "), the Company shall
give prompt written notice to each Investor of its intention to effect such a
registration (but in no event less than ten (10) days prior to the proposed
date of filing of the applicable Registration Statement) and, subject to
_Sections 1.5(b)_ , _1.5(c)_ and _2.1_ , shall include in such Registration
Statement and in any offering of Equity Securities to be made pursuant to such
Registration Statement that number of Registrable Securities requested to be
sold in such offering by such Investor for the account of such Investor,
_provided_ that the Company has received a written request for inclusion
therein from such Investor no later than five (5) business days after the date
on which the Company has given notice of the Piggyback Registration to
Investors. The Company may terminate, delay or withdraw a Piggyback
Registration prior to the effectiveness of such registration at any time in
its sole discretion and, thereupon, (x) in the case of a determination to
terminate or withdraw any registration, the Company shall be relieved of its
obligation to register any Registrable Securities under this _Section 1.5_ in
connection with such registration and (y) in the case of a determination to
delay registration, the Company shall be permitted to delay registering any
Registrable Securities under this _Section 1.5_ for the same period as the
delay in registering the other equity securities covered by such registration.
If a Piggyback Registration is effected pursuant to a Registration Statement
on Form S-3 or the then-appropriate form for an offering to be made on a
delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act or
any successor rule thereto (a " _Piggyback Shelf Registration Statement_ "),
the Investors shall be notified by the Company of and shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to participate in any offering pursuant to such
Piggyback Shelf Registration Statement (a " _Piggyback Shelf Take-Down_ "),
subject to the same limitations that are applicable to any other Piggyback
Registration as set forth above.

 



   

     
 

 



 

(b) _Priority on Primary Registrations_. If a Piggyback Registration or
Piggyback Shelf Take-Down is initiated as a primary underwritten offering on
behalf of the Company and the managing underwriters of the offering advise the
Company in writing that, in their opinion, the number of Equity Securities
proposed to be included in such offering, including all Registrable Securities
and all other Equity Securities proposed to be included in such offering,
exceeds the number of Equity Securities that can reasonably be expected to be
sold in such offering without adversely affecting the success of the offering
(including the price, timing or distribution of the securities to be sold in
such offering), the Company shall include in such Piggyback Registration or
Piggyback Shelf Take-Down: (i) _first_ , the Equity Securities that the
Company proposes to sell in such offering; (ii) _second_ , the Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration by the Parent or any
other Investor, allocated, in the case of this _clause (ii)_, _pro rata_
among such Investors on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities
initially proposed to be included by each such Investor in such offering; and
(iii) _third_ , any Equity Securities proposed to be included in such
offering by any other Person to whom the Company has a contractual obligation
to facilitate such offering (subject to _Section 1.12(a)_), allocated, in the
case of this _clause (iii)_, among such Persons in such manner as the Company
may determine, up to the number of Equity Securities, if any, that the
managing underwriters determine can be included in the offering without
reasonably being expected to adversely affect the success of the offering
(including the price, timing or distribution of the securities to be offered
in such offering).

 



 

(c) _Priority on Secondary Registrations_. If a Piggyback Registration or a
Piggyback Shelf Take-Down is initiated as an underwritten offering other than
on behalf of the Company, and the managing underwriters of the offering advise
the Company in writing that, in their opinion, the number of Equity Securities
proposed to be included in such offering, including all Registrable Securities
and all other Equity Securities requested to be included in such offering,
exceeds the number of Equity Securities which can reasonably be expected to be
sold in such offering without adversely affecting the success of the offering
(including the price, timing or distribution of the securities to be sold in
such offering), the Company shall include in such Piggyback Registration or
Piggyback Shelf Take-Down: (i) _first_ , the Registrable Securities requested
to be included in such registration by the Parent or any other Investor,
allocated, in the case of this _clause (i)_, _pro rata_ among such Investors
on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities initially proposed to be
included by each such Investor in such offering; and (ii) _second_ , any
Equity Securities proposed to be included in such offering by any other Person
to whom the Company has a contractual obligation to facilitate such offering
(subject to _Section 1.12(a)_) and any Equity Securities that the Company
proposes to sell in such offering, allocated, in the case of this _clause
(ii)_, among such Persons in such manner as the Company may determine, up to
the number of Equity Securities, if any, that the managing underwriters
determine can be included in the offering without reasonably being expected to
adversely affect the success of the offering (including the price, timing or
distribution of the securities to be offered in such offering).

 



 

(d) _Selection of Underwriters_. In any Piggyback Registration or Piggyback
Shelf Take-Down, including if initiated as a primary underwritten offering on
behalf of the Company or another securityholder, the Company shall have the
right to select the investment banking firm(s) to act as the underwriters
(including managing underwriter(s)) in connection with such offering.

 



      
 

 



 

1.6 _Holdback Agreement_.

 



 

(a) For so long as Parent and any other Investor, individually or together,
holds or Beneficially Owns at least five percent (5%) of the issued and
outstanding Company Common Stock on an as-converted basis, each Investor
agrees that in connection with any registered underwritten offering of Company
Common Stock, and upon request from the managing underwriter(s) for such
offering, such Investor shall not, without the prior written consent of such
managing underwriter(s), during such period as is reasonably requested by the
managing underwriter(s) (which period shall in no event be longer than three
(3) days prior to and ninety (90) days after the launch of such offering),
Transfer any Registrable Securities. The foregoing provisions of this _Section
1.6(a)_ shall not apply to offers or sales of Registrable Securities that are
included in an offering pursuant to _Section 1.1_, _1.2_ or _1.5_ of this
Agreement and shall be applicable to the Investors only if, for so long as and
to the extent that the Company, the directors and executive officers of the
Company and each selling stockholder included in such offering are subject to
the same restrictions. Each Investor agrees to execute and deliver such
customary agreements as may be reasonably requested by the managing
underwriter(s) that are consistent with the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 1.6(a)_ and are necessary to give further effect thereto; _provided_
, that the terms of such agreements shall not be more restrictive than the
restrictions to which the directors and executive officers of the Company are
subject.

 



 

(b) To the extent requested by the managing underwriter(s) for the applicable
offering, the Company and its directors and executive officers shall not
effect any sale registered under the Securities Act or other public
distribution of Equity Securities during the period commencing three (3) days
prior to and ending ninety (90) days after the launch of an underwritten
offering pursuant to _Section 1.1_, _1.2_ or _1.5_ of this Agreement, other
than a registration (i) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or
other registration solely relating to an offering or sale to employees or
directors of the Company pursuant to any employee stock plan or other employee
benefit arrangement), (ii) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-4
(or similar form that relates to a transaction subject to Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), (iii) pursuant to a
registration in which the Company is offering to exchange its own securities
for other securities or (iv) in connection with any dividend or distribution
reinvestment or similar plan.

 



 

1.7 _Registration Procedures_.

 



 

(a) In connection with the registration obligations of the Company pursuant to
and in accordance with this Agreement, the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to effect the registration and sale of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof as
promptly as reasonably practicable, the Company shall:

 



 

(i) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to
such Registrable Securities, cooperate with underwriters counsel in an
underwritten offering in connection with all required filings with FINRA and
thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration
Statement to become effective upon filing but in any event as soon as
reasonably practicable after the filing of such Registration Statement (
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Registration Statement covering Registrable
Securities other than Perpetual Preferred Shares filed pursuant to _Section
1.2(a)_ need not be declared effective

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Six-Month Restricted Date); _provided_ , that before filing a
Registration Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto (other than
reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act that are
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration
Statement), the Company will furnish to the Parent and the other Investors
copies of all documents proposed to be filed. In the case of a Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section 1.1_ or _1.2_ , if the Parent informs the
Company that it has any objections to the filing of such Registration
Statement, amendment or supplement, the Company will not file such
Registration Statement, amendment or supplement. In the case of a Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section 1.5_, the Company will not file any
Registration Statement or amendment or supplement to such Registration
Statement to which the Parent will have reasonably objected on the grounds
that such amendment or supplement does not comply in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act or of the rules or regulations
thereunder;

 



 

(ii) use reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments and supplements to any Registration Statement and the Prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective until all of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been disposed of and comply with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement;

 



 

(iii) furnish to the Parent and the other Investors, without charge, such
number of conformed copies of such Registration Statement and of each post-
effective amendment thereto, and deliver, without charge, such number of
copies of each preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, all exhibits and
other documents filed therewith and such other documents as the Parent and the
other Investors may reasonably request including in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by it or any Investor;

 



 

(iv) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions
as the Parent and the other Investors reasonably request in writing;
_provided_ that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do
business, subject itself to taxation or consent to general service of process
in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to do so but for
its obligations pursuant to this _Section 1.7(a)(iv)_;

 



 

(v) promptly as reasonably practicable notify the Parent and the other
Investors, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act, upon discovery that, or upon the discovery
of the happening of any event as a result of which, the prospectus contains an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, and, as promptly as practicable, prepare and furnish to
the Parent and the other Investors a reasonable number of copies of a
supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to
the purchasers of such

 



      
 

 



 

Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made; _provided_ , that any Investor receiving information pursuant to this
_Section 1.7(a)(v)_ shall protect the confidentiality of, and not disclose,
any information regarding the Company which the Company determines in good
faith to be confidential and of which determination such Person is notified,
unless such information (A) is or becomes known to the public without a breach
of this Agreement or any other agreement to which such Person is a party, (B)
is or becomes available to such Person on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Company, (C) is independently developed by such Person,
(D) is requested or required by a deposition, interrogatory, request for
information or documents by a Governmental Authority, subpoena or similar
process, or (E) is otherwise required to be disclosed by applicable Law (other
than securities Laws);

 



 

(vi) promptly notify the Parent and the other Investors (A) when the
prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been
filed and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment, when the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the SEC
for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or to amend or to
supplement such prospectus or for additional information, (C) of the issuance
by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for such purpose and (D) of the
receipt by the Company or its legal counsel of any notification with respect
to the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities
for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose;

 



 

(vii) use reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities to
be listed on each securities exchange, if any, on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed;

 



 

(viii) enter into such customary agreements (including underwriting agreements
in form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings) and
take all such appropriate and reasonable other actions as the Parent, the
Investors or the underwriters, if any, reasonably request in order to expedite
or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

 



 

(ix) if such offering is an underwritten offering, make available upon
reasonable notice at reasonable times and for reasonable periods for
inspection by the Parent, the other Investors, any underwriter participating
in any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement and any counsel,
accountant or other agent retained by the Parent and the other Investors or
any such underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents of the Company related to the Company and its business as will be
reasonably necessary and requested by such Investor(s) or underwriters to
enable them to reasonably exercise their due diligence responsibilities,
_provided_ that any Person receiving access to information or personnel
pursuant to this _Section 1.7(a)(ix)_ shall (i) reasonably cooperate with the
Company to limit any resulting disruption to the

 



      
 

 



 

Companys business and (ii) protect the confidentiality of, and not disclose,
any information regarding the Company which the Company determines in good
faith to be confidential and of which determination such Person is notified,
unless such information (A) is or becomes known to the public without a breach
of this Agreement or any other to which such Person is a party, (B) is or
becomes available to such Person on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Company, (C) is independently developed by such Person, (D) is
requested or required by a deposition, interrogatory, request for information
or documents by a Governmental Authority, subpoena or similar process, or (E)
is otherwise required to be disclosed by applicable law (other than securities
laws);

 



 

(x) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security holders,
as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement in a form that
satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the U.S. Securities Act and Rule
158 thereunder, which requirement shall be deemed satisfied if the Company
timely files complete and accurate information on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K
under the Exchange Act and otherwise complies with Rule 158 under the
Securities Act or any successor rule thereto;

 



 

(xi) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or of any order suspending or
preventing the use of any related prospectus or ceasing trading of any
securities included in such Registration Statement for sale in any
jurisdiction, use reasonable best efforts promptly to obtain the withdrawal of
such order at the earliest practicable time;

 



 

(xii) enter into such agreements and take such other actions as the Parent,
the Investors or the underwriters reasonably request in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities, including, without
limitation, entering into a customary underwriting agreement and preparing for
and participating in such customary selling efforts as the underwriters
reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate such disposition,
including, as the underwriters reasonably request, making members of senior
management of the Company, as would customarily participate in "road show" and
other customary marketing activities for an offering by the Company comparable
to such offering in size and type of securities offered, cooperate with the
managing underwriters or underwriter and make themselves available to
participate on a reasonable basis in "road show" and other customary marketing
activities reasonably requested by the managing underwriter(s);

 



 

(xiii) if such offering is an underwritten offering, use reasonable best
efforts to furnish to the Parent, each underwriter and the other Investors one
or more comfort letters, addressed to the underwriters, the Parent and the
Investors, dated the effective date of, or the date of the final receipt
issued for, such Registration Statement (the date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement for such offering), signed by the Companys independent
public accountants in

 



      
 

 



 

customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
comfort letters in similar underwritten offerings;

 



 

(xiv) if such offering is an underwritten offering, use its reasonable best
efforts to provide legal opinions of the Companys outside counsel, addressed
to the underwriters, dated the effective date of, or the date of the final
receipt issued for, such Registration Statement (the date of the closing under
the underwriting agreement for such offering), each amendment and supplement
thereto, with respect to the Registration Statement, each amendment and
supplement thereto (including the preliminary prospectus) and such other
documents relating thereto in customary form and covering such matters of the
type customarily covered by legal opinions of such nature;

 



 

(xv) make available to the Parent and the other Investors each item of
correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and each item of
correspondence written by or on behalf of the Company to the SEC or the staff
of the SEC, in each case solely relating to such Registration Statement; and

 



 

(xvi) use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the cooperation of the
Companys transfer agent in settling any Transfer of Registrable Securities,
including (A) with respect to the transfer of any physical stock certificates
representing common stock into book-entry form in accordance with any
procedures reasonably requested by the Parent or the Investors or the
underwriters, and (B) to the extent such Registrable Securities are subject to
a restrictive legend, by removing such legend (or eliminating or terminating
such comparable notations or arrangements on securities held in book-entry
form) and, if required by the Companys transfer agent, delivering an opinion
of the Companys counsel that the restriction referenced in such legend (or
such notations or arrangements) is no longer required in order to ensure
compliance with the Securities Act.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees not to file or make any amendment to any Registration
Statement with respect to any Registrable Securities, or any amendment of or
supplement to the prospectus used in connection therewith, that refers to the
Parent or any other Investor by name, or otherwise identifies the Parent or
any other Investor as the holder of any securities of the Company, without the
consent of the Parent (any such consent to be binding on each other Investor),
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless and to the
extent such disclosure is required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Company may require the Parent and any other Investor to furnish the
Company with such information regarding the Parent and such other Investor and
pertinent to the disclosure requirements relating to the registration and the
distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time
reasonably request in writing. If within twenty (20) Business Days of the
receipt of such a written request from the Company, the Parent or any other
Investor fails to provide to the Company any information relating to the
Parent or such Investor, as applicable, that is required by applicable law to
be disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Company may exclude the
Parents and such Investors, as applicable, Registrable Securities from such
Registration Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Parent agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the
happening of any event of the kind described in _Section 1.7(a)(v)_,
_1.7(a)(vi)(B)_ , _1.7(a)(vi)(C)_ or _1.7(a)(vi)(D)_ hereof, to the extent
that such event requires the discontinuance of the disposition of Registrable
Securities covered by a Registration Statement or the related prospectus and
such notice reasonably requests such discontinuance, that the Parent shall
discontinue, and shall cause each Investor to discontinue, disposition of any
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or the related
prospectus until receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by _Section 1.7(a)(iii)_ hereof, which supplement or
amendment shall be prepared and furnished as soon as practicable, or until the
Parent and the other Investors are advised in writing by the Company that the
use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of
any amended or supplemented prospectus or any additional or supplemental
filings which are incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference in
such prospectus (such period during which disposition is discontinued being an
" _Interruption Period_ ") and, if requested by the Company, the Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to return to the Company all copies
then in its possession or in the possession of any Investor, other than
permanent file copies then in such holders possession, of the prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such request.
As soon as practicable (and in any event no later than two (2) Business Days)
after the Company has determined that the use of the applicable prospectus may
be resumed, the Company shall provide written notice to the Parent and the
other Investors. In the event the Company invokes an Interruption Period
hereunder, as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than two (2)
Business Days) after the need for the Company to continue the Interruption
Period ceases for any reason, the Company shall provide written notice to the
Parent and the other Investors that such Interruption Period is no longer
applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, no
Interruption Period shall exceed sixty (60) days and, in any calendar year, no
more than one hundred twenty (120) days in the aggregate may be part of an
Interruption Period.

 



 

1.8 _Registration Expenses_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall pay directly or promptly reimburse all costs, fees and
expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incident to the Companys performance
of or compliance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) all
SEC, FINRA and other registration and filing fees; (ii) all fees and expenses

Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement; and (ix) all fees and
expenses of underwriters (other than Selling Expenses) customarily paid by the
issuers or sellers of securities (all such costs, fees and expenses, "
_Registration Expenses_ "). Each

 



      
 

 



 

Investor shall pay the fees and expenses of any counsel engaged by such
Investor and shall bear its respective Selling Expenses associated with a
registered sale of its Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The obligation of the Company to bear and pay the Registration Expenses
shall apply irrespective of whether a registration, once properly demanded or
requested, becomes effective or is withdrawn or suspended; _provided_ , that
the Registration Expenses for any Registration Statement withdrawn solely at
the request of one or more Investor(s) (unless withdrawn following
commencement of a suspension pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)_) shall be borne by
such Investor(s).

 



 

1.9 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) In connection with the registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to
this Agreement, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, and hereby
does indemnify and hold harmless, the Parent and the other Investors, their
affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and partners
and each Person who is a "controlling person" of the Parent or the other
Investors (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act)
against, and pay and reimburse the Parent and the other Investors, affiliate,
director, officer, employee or partner or controlling person for any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, (collectively, " _Losses_ ") joint or several,
to which the Parent and the other Investors or any such affiliate, director,
officer, employee or partner or controlling person may become subject under
the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, or any "issuer free writing prospectus" as such term is defined under
Rule 433 under the Securities Act or (ii) any omission or alleged omission of
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and the Company will pay and reimburse the
Parent and the other Investors and each such affiliate, director, officer,
employee, partner and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating,
defending or settling any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding;
_provided_ that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such Losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission, made in such
Registration Statement, any such prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any "issuer free writing prospectus" as
such term is defined under Rule 433 under the Securities Act, or in any
application, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information
prepared and furnished to the Company by the Parent or any other Investor
expressly for use therein and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall
not be liable to the extent that any Losses arise out of or are based upon the
use of any prospectus after such time as the Company has advised Parent or any
other Investor in writing that a post-effective amendment or supplement
thereto is required.

 



 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Parent or any
other Investor is participating, the Parent and each other Investor will
furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the
Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration
Statement or prospectus and will indemnify and hold

 



      
 

 



 

harmless the Company, its directors and officers, each underwriter and each
other Person who is a "controlling person" of the Parent or the other
Investors (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) and
each such underwriter against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint
or several, to which the Company or any such director or officer, any such
underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act
or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in
any application, (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or (iii) the failure of such Investor to deliver a prospectus in
accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act, but, with respect to
_clauses (i)_ and (ii), only to the extent that such untrue statement or
omission is made in such Registration Statement, any such prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any
application, in each case in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written
information prepared and furnished to the Company by the Parent or any other
Investor expressly for use therein, and the Parent and any such other Investor
will reimburse the Company and each such director, officer, underwriter and
controlling Person for any legal or any other expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating, defending or settling any
such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding; _provided_ that the
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless will be limited to the net amount of
proceeds received by the Parent and each other Investor (in the aggregate)
from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement.

 



 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying
parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party
to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). If such
defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent
(but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party
who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will
not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
_provided_ that the indemnifying party will be liable for one additional
counsel if in the reasonable judgment of counsel for any indemnified party a
conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of
such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.

 



 

(d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such
indemnified party and will survive the registration and sale of any securities
by any Person entitled to any indemnification hereunder and the expiration or
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 1.9_ is legally
unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability,
claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party

 



      
 

 



 

thereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party will be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount the
Parent and any other Investor will be obligated to contribute pursuant to this
_Section 1.9(e)_ will be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds received
by the Parent and each other Investor (in the aggregate) in respect of the
Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Registration Statement which gives
rise to such obligation to contribute (less the aggregate amount of any
damages which the Parent and each other Investor has otherwise been required
to pay in respect of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action or any
substantially similar loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from
the sale of such Registrable Securities).

 



 

1.10 _Participation in Underwritten Registrations_. No Person may participate
in any underwritten offering pursuant to this Agreement unless such Person (i)
agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements in customary form approved by the Persons entitled
under this Agreement to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements; _provided_ , that no Investor included in any
underwritten offering shall be required to make any representations or
warranties to the Company or the underwriters (other than representations and
warranties regarding (A) such Investors ownership of its Registrable
Securities to be sold in such offering, (B) such Investors power and
authority to effect such Transfer and (C) such matters pertaining to such
Investors compliance with securities laws as may be reasonably requested by
the managing underwriter(s)) or to undertake any indemnification obligations
to the Company or the underwriters with respect thereto, except to the extent
otherwise provided in _Section 1.9_ hereof.

 



 

1.11 _Rule 144 and 144A Reporting_.

 



 

(a) With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and
regulations of the SEC which may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities

subject to such reporting requirements.

 



 

Upon request of the Parent or the other Investors, the Company will deliver to
the Parent and the other Investors a written statement as to whether it has
complied with such informational and reporting requirements and will, within
the limitations of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 (as such rule may be
amended from time to time) or any similar rule enacted by the SEC, instruct

the Company, upon written request of the Parent prior to the time of sale, a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such
other reports and documents that the Company would have been required to file
if the Company were subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act as the Parent, the Investors or prospective
purchaser may reasonably request in writing in availing itself of any rule or
regulation of the SEC allowing the Parent or any other Investor, as

1.12 _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company represents and warrants that it
has not entered into, and agrees that it will not enter into, any agreement
with respect to its securities that violates or subordinates or is otherwise
inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities
under this Agreement. For the term of this Agreement, the Company shall not
grant to any Person the right to require the Company to register any Equity
Securities of the Company, or any securities convertible or exchangeable into

its own initiative, except to the extent required by applicable law or an
enforceable court order, propose any of the following actions to be taken by

affect the ability of the Parent or the other Investors to include the
Registrable Securities in a registration undertaken pursuant to this
Agreement: (i) implementing Transfer restrictions on Subject Securities, (ii)
implementing limits on dispositions of Subject Securities, (iii) adopting
restrictions on the nature of Transferees of Subject Securities or (iv)
implementing or adopting any similar restrictions or limitations with respect
to the Transfer of Subject Securities in violation of the terms of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any actions which occur by operation of
Law, pursuant to an enforceable court order or are taken by the general

1.12(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Dilution_. If, from time to time, there is any change in the capital
structure of the Company by way of a split, dividend, combination or
reclassification, or through a merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
reorganization or recapitalization, or by any other means, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the provisions hereof so that the rights and
privileges granted hereby shall continue.

 



 

(d) _Conversion of Other Securities_. If the Parent or any other Investor
offers Registrable Securities by forward sale, or by an offering (directly or
by entering into a derivative transaction with a broker-dealer or other
financial institution) of any options, rights, warrants or other securities
that are offered with, convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any

 



      
 

 



 

Registrable Securities, the Registrable Securities subject to such forward
sale or underlying such options, rights or warrants or other securities shall
be eligible for registration pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

1.13 _Subject to Transfer Restrictions_. For the avoidance of doubt, any
exercise by any Investor of its rights pursuant to _Section 1.1_ or _Section

TAX MATTERS

 



 

3.1 _Tax Return Information_. The Company will as promptly as practicable
furnish to any Investor information reasonably requested to enable such
Investor or its direct or indirect equity owners to comply with any applicable
tax reporting requirements with respect to Convertible Preferred Shares and
Perpetual Preferred Shares held by such Investor, including, without
limitation, such information as may be reasonably requested by such Investor
to complete U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax returns
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, information regarding the source of
any dividends paid or deemed paid with respect to Convertible Preferred Shares
and Perpetual Preferred Shares held by such Investor or its direct or indirect
equity owners); _provided_ , that this _Section 3.1_ shall not require the
Company to provide information to any Investor regarding the computation of
earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and any Investor
should assume that the Companys distributions constitute dividends for U.S.
federal income tax purposes), except to the extent that such information is
otherwise required to be provided by the Company under _Section 3.2_ or
_Section 3.3_. The Company will provide any tax-related information that is
required to be provided to the Investors by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of a fiscal year within sixty (60) calendar days

3.2 _PFIC and CFC Information_. After the end of each taxable year, the
Company will timely determine whether the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is expected to be, or was, a PFIC or CFC for any taxable year and inform the
Investors of its determination. If the Company believes the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a PFIC or a CFC for any taxable year or there is a
reasonable possibility that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be a
PFIC or a CFC for any taxable year, the Company will prepare an annual
statement that sets forth the amount that the Investors would be required to
include in taxable income on their U.S. tax returns if the Company or such
Subsidiary were in fact to constitute a PFIC or a CFC for such taxable year,
as well as any other information required to comply with applicable CFC and
PFIC reporting requirements. Each of the Investors will cooperate with the
Company, and provide such information as may be reasonably requested by the
Company, to determine whether the Company is a CFC.

 



 

3.3 _QEF Election_. If the Company believes there is a reasonable possibility
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries constitutes a PFIC for any taxable
year, the Company will provide the Investors with the information necessary in
order for the Investors or any direct or indirect equity owner therein, as the
case may be, to timely and properly make an election under section 1295 of the
Code to treat the Company or such Subsidiary as a "qualified electing fund" (a
" _QEF Election_ ") and comply with the reporting requirements applicable to
such a QEF Election. The Company will obtain professional assistance
experienced in matters relating to the relevant aspects of the Code to the
extent necessary to make the determinations and to provide the information and
statements described in _Section 3.2_ and this _Section 3.3_.

and in the amounts determined as set forth in this Section 4, and no more.

 



 

(b) In the event any dividend on any Common Share is declared by the Board of
Directors or paid or any other distribution is made on or with respect to any
Common Share, the Holder of each outstanding share of Series D Preferred Stock
as of the record date established by the Board of Directors for such dividend
or distribution (each, a " _Record Date_ ") shall be entitled to receive
dividends in an amount equal to the product of (x) the per share dividend or
other distribution declared or paid in respect of such Common Share and (y)
the Applicable Conversion Rate as of the Record Date on such Common Share,
such dividends to be payable on the same payment date established by the Board
of Directors for the payment of such dividend or distribution on such Common
Share. The Record Date for any such dividend shall be the Record Date for the
applicable dividend or distribution on the Common Share, and any such

Stock in an amount determined as set forth above; _provided_ that any dividend

by the Company of cash, property, securities (including, but not limited to,

Common Shares, whether or not paid out of capital, surplus or earnings, other
than a distribution upon Liquidation of the Company in accordance with Section

(d) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized and unissued Series D Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock required for purposes of paying all PIK Dividends
that may become payable.

 



 

(e) So long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, if
all dividends payable pursuant to this Section 4 on all outstanding shares of
the Series D Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period have not been declared
and paid, or declared and funds set aside therefor, the Company shall not (x)
declare or pay dividends with respect to, or, directly or indirectly, redeem,
purchase or acquire any of its Junior Securities or (y) directly or
indirectly, redeem, purchase or acquire any of its Parity Securities, other

Securities or Parity Securities in connection with any employment contract,
benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one
or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or in connection with a

with any stockholders rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other
property under any stockholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase

of such share of Series D Preferred Stock will not have the right to receive
dividends on such share; _provided_ that the Holder of such share shall
receive the dividend, if any, payable to the holders of the Common Shares into
which such share is converted on such dividend payment date.

 



       
 

 



 

(g) The Company shall not declare or pay a dividend if the Company has
reasonable grounds for believing that (i) the Company is or, after giving
effect to such payment, would be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become
due, or (ii) the realizable value of the Companys assets would thereby be
less than the Companys liabilities, or (iii) the Company is or, after such
payment, would be in breach of any applicable individual or group solvency and
liquidity requirements or applicable individual or group enhanced capital
requirements or such other applicable rules, regulations or restrictions as
may from time to time be issued by the BMA pursuant to the terms of the
Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations and rules or any
successor legislation or then applicable law.

 



 

 _Section 5._ _Liquidation_. In the event of a Liquidation, the holders of
the Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled (i) to a
preference of US$0.0001 per share over any Common Shares with respect to the
surplus assets of the Company and (ii) thereafter to the surplus assets of the
Company on a pari passu basis with any Parity Securities.

 



 

 _Section 6._ _Maturity_. The Series D Preferred Stock shall be perpetual
unless converted in accordance with this Certificate of Designations.

 



 

 _Section 7._ _Automatic Conversions_.

 



 

(a) Each share of Series D Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted
into that number of fully paid and non-assessable Common Shares equal to the
Applicable Conversion Rate, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 13 hereof, upon the Transfer thereof to a third party
in a Widely Dispersed Offering by an Initial Holder or any Affiliate of an
Initial Holder or any direct or indirect transferee of an Initial Holder that
did not receive such shares in a Widely Dispersed Offering. Holders of shares
of Series D Preferred Stock shall give prompt notice to the Company of any
Transfer of Series D Preferred Stock (whether by an Initial Holder or any
Affiliate of an Initial Holder or any direct or indirect transferee of an
Initial Holder that did not receive such shares in a Widely Dispersed
Offering) that results in the conversion of the shares of Series D Preferred
Stock into Common Shares.

 



 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Holders of Series D Preferred Stock shall
not be permitted to convert such shares into any other class of the Companys
share capital, except pursuant to this Section 7.

 



 

 _Section 8._ _Conversion Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Effective immediately prior to the close of business on the date of
conversion of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock (the " _Conversion Date_
"), dividends shall no longer be declared on any such shares of Series D
Preferred Stock and such shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall cease to be
outstanding, in each case, subject to the right of the Holder to receive any
declared and unpaid dividends on such share to the extent provided in Section
4(f) and any other payments to which such Holder is otherwise entitled
pursuant to Section 11 or Section 13 hereof, as applicable.

 



 

(b) No allowance or adjustment, except pursuant to Section 10, shall be made
in respect of dividends payable to holders of the Common Shares of record as
of any date prior to the close of business on the Conversion Date with respect
to any share of Series D Preferred Stock. Prior to the close of business on
the Conversion Date with respect to any share of Series D Preferred Stock,
securities issuable upon conversion of such share of Series D Preferred Stock
shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and the Holder thereof shall
have no rights with respect to the Common Shares or other securities issuable
upon conversion (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers
for the securities issuable upon conversion and rights to receive any
dividends or other distributions on the securities issuable upon conversion)
by virtue of holding such share of Series D Preferred Stock.

 



 

(c) Effective immediately upon the occurrence of the conversion, certificates
theretofore evidencing shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be deemed to
evidence that whole number of Common Shares issuable upon the conversion of
such shares of Series D Preferred Stock. After any Transfer resulting in a
conversion of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 7(a),
the new Holder of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock so converted (and any
subsequent transferee thereof) shall be entitled to surrender the
certificate(s) representing such

 



      
 

 



 

shares at the office of the Company, and promptly after any such surrender,
and if required, the furnishing of appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and the payment of all transfer and similar taxes, the Company shall
issue and deliver to such Holder or on the Holders written order to the
Holders transferee either a certificate or certificates for the whole number
of Common Shares that were issuable upon conversion or, alternatively, other
appropriate evidence of such shares registered in book entry form.

 



 

(d) Shares of Series D Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance with this
Certificate of Designations, or otherwise reacquired by the Company, will
resume the status of authorized and unissued preference shares, undesignated
as to series and available for future issuance. The Company may from time to
time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized
number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not take any such action if such action would reduce the
authorized number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock below the number of
shares of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding.

 



 

(e) The Person or Persons entitled to receive the securities and/or cash or
other property issuable upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such securities as of the
close of business on the Conversion Date with respect thereto. In the event
that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which
securities and/or cash or other property (including payments of cash in lieu
of fractional shares) to be issued or paid upon conversion of shares of Series
D Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such
shares should be delivered, the Company shall be entitled to register and
deliver such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder and in
the manner shown on the records of the Company.

 



 

 _Section 9._ _Self-Tender Offers; Rights Plan_.

 



 

(a) If the Company or any of its subsidiaries makes a tender or exchange offer
to any holder of Common Shares, the Company or such subsidiary shall
simultaneously make an offer on the same terms, on an as-converted per share
basis, to each Holder of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock.

 



 

(b) If at any time the Company has a shareholder rights plan in effect with
respect to the Common Shares, the shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to be Common Shares for purposes of such plan and shall participate
therein on an as-converted basis. Upon conversion of any shares of Series D
Preferred Stock, the holders of such converted shares will receive, in
addition to the Common Shares, the rights under the rights plan, to the extent
such rights have not separated from the Common Shares. For the avoidance of
doubt, if rights under any such plan separate from the Common Shares before
the Conversion Date, such separation of rights shall be deemed to be a
dividend for purposes of Section 4 hereof, and the Holders of the shares of
Series D Preferred Stock shall receive such dividend as provided in Section 4.

 



 

 _Section 10._ _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) If the Company subdivides, splits or combines the Common Shares, then the
Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the effective date of such
share subdivision, split or combination will be multiplied by the following
fraction:

 



    

OS1 

--- 
   

OS0 

 



 

where

 



 

OS1 = the sum of Common Shares issued immediately after the opening of
business on the effective date of such share subdivision, split or
combination; and

 



 

OS0 = the sum of Common Shares issued immediately prior to the effective date
of such share subdivision, split or combination.

 



      
 

 



 

For the purposes of this Section 10(a), the number of Common Shares at the
time issued shall not include shares acquired by the Company and cancelled.
If any subdivision, split or combination described in this Section 10(a) is
announced but the outstanding Common Shares are not subdivided, split or
combined, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date
the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to subdivide, split
or combine the outstanding Common Shares, to such Conversion Rate that would
be in effect if such subdivision, split or combination had not been announced.

 



 

(b) Whenever the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted in accordance with Section
10(a), the Company shall: (i) compute the Conversion Rate in accordance with
Section 10(a); (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an
event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section
10(a) (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as
practicable after becoming so aware), provide, or cause to be provided, a
written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event; and (iii) as
soon as practicable following the determination of the revised Conversion Rate
in accordance with Section 10(a) hereof, provide, or cause to be provided, a
written notice to the Holders setting forth in reasonable detail the method by
which the adjustment to the Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth
the revised Conversion Rate.

 



 

 _Section 11._ _Reorganization Events_.

 



 

(a) In the event that, prior to the Conversion Date with respect to the shares
of Series D Preferred Stock of any Holder there occurs:

 



 

(i) any consolidation, merger, tender or exchange offer, amalgamation or other
similar business combination of the Company with or into another Person, in
each case pursuant to which the Common Shares will be converted into cash,
securities or other property of the Company or another Person;

 



 

(ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or
substantially all of the property and assets of the Company, in each case
pursuant to which the Common Shares will be converted into cash, securities or
other property of the Company or another Person;

 



 

(iii) any reclassification of the Common Shares into securities including
securities other than the Common Shares; or

 



 

(iv) any statutory exchange of the outstanding Common Shares for securities of
another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition)

 



 

(any such event specified in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), a "
_Reorganization Event_ "), then each share of such Holders Series D Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall
automatically, effective as of the close of business on the closing date of
such Reorganization Event, be cancelled and such Holder shall receive, on
account of each cancelled Series D Preferred Share held by it immediately
prior to the occurrence of such Reorganization Event, the type and amount of
securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event by
the holder of a Common Share (excluding the holder counterparty to the
Reorganization Event or an Affiliate of such counterparty) multiplied by the
Applicable Conversion Rate; _provided_ that if the consideration payable in
any such Reorganization Event consists (in whole or in part) of property or
securities that would reasonably be expected to create, aggravate or
exacerbate any issue, problem or concern for any Holder or any of its
Affiliates, then the Holders and the Company or the counter-party to such
Reorganization Event shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
consideration payable to such Holder shall be adjusted ( _e.g._ , by the
issuance of non-voting securities that are economically equivalent to the
voting securities they replaced and would convert into such voting securities
on transfer to an unaffiliated third party, subject to the conversion
restrictions set forth in Section 7(a)) to the maximum extent practicable to
eliminate or address such issue, problem or concern, so long as such adjusted
or different securities have the same value as, and are _pari passu_ with, the
securities that they replaced (such securities, cash and other property, the "
_Exchange Property_ ").

 



 

(b) In the event that holders of Common Shares have the opportunity to elect
the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the
consideration that the Holders are entitled to receive shall be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority
of the holders of Common Shares that affirmatively make an election.

 



 

(c) The above provisions of this Section 11 shall similarly apply to
successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 10 shall apply
to any shares of capital stock of the Company (or any successor) received by
the holders of Common Shares in any such Reorganization Event.

 



 

(d) The Company (or any successor) shall, within seven days of the
consummation of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the
Holders of such consummation of such event and of the kind and amount of the
cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property.
Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section
11.

 



 

(e) The Company shall not enter into any agreement for a transaction
constituting a Reorganization Event unless such agreement provides for or does
not interfere with or prevent (as applicable) conversion of the Series D
Preferred Stock into the Exchange Property in a manner that is consistent with
and gives effect to this Section 11.

 



 

 _Section 12._ _Voting Rights_.

 



 

(a) _General_. The Holders of Series D Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights except the limited voting rights as set forth below or as
otherwise from time to time required by law.

 



 

(b) _Class Voting Rights as to Particular Matters_. Subject to the provisions
of the Bye-Laws and the Companies Act, so long as any shares of Series D

amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise) so as to significantly and adversely
affect the rights, preferences, privileges or limited voting rights of the
Series D Preferred Stock;

 



 

(ii) _Share Exchanges, Reclassifications and Consolidations_. A consummation
of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series D
Preferred Stock, or of a consolidation of the Company with another corporation
or other entity (except for any such consolidation in which the consideration
paid to shareholders is entirely in cash), unless in each case (x) the shares
of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such
consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or
resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of
the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares
remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have
such rights, preferences, privileges and limited voting rights, and
limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially
less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges
and limited voting rights, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the
Series D Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a
whole; or

 



 

(iii) _Dissolution_. The voluntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of
the Company.

 



 

(c) _Changes for Clarification_. Subject to applicable Bermuda law and
regulation, without the consent of the holders of the Series D Preferred
Stock, so long as such action does not affect the special rights, preferences,
privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions, of the Series
D Preferred Stock taken as a whole, the Company may amend, restate, alter,
supplement, modify or repeal any terms of the Series D Preferred Stock:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision
contained in this Certificate of Designations that may be defective or
inconsistent; or

 



 

(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with
respect to the Series D Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Certificate of Designations.

 



 

(d) _Procedures for Voting and Consents_. The rules and procedures for calling
and conducting any meeting of the Holders of Series D Preferred Stock
(including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection
therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the
obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to
such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its
discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall
conform to the requirements of the Bye-Laws, applicable law and any national
securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series D Preferred
Stock are listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the
Holders of a majority or other portion of the shares of Series D Preferred
Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the Holders of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to vote shall be determined by the
Company by reference to the aggregate voting power, as determined by the Bye-
Laws, of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock voted or covered by the
consent.

 



 

(e) _Bye-Laws_. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 12
shall be subject to Bye-law 45 (as may be amended, restated, supplemented,

Closing Price of the Common Shares determined as of the second Trading Day
immediately preceding the Conversion Date.

 



 

(c) If more than one share of the Series D Preferred Stock is surrendered for
conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full Common
Shares issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock so surrendered.

 



 

 _Section 14._ _Reservation of Common Shares_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized and unissued Common Shares or shares acquired by the Company and
held as treasury shares, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of

 **EXHIBIT D**

 



 

 **ACQUIROR PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK TERMS**

 



 

The terms of the Acquiror Perpetual Preferred Stock will be substantially
similar to the Acquirors existing Series C Preferred Stock, other than (i)
economic terms such as dividend rate and redemption features, (ii) changes
made (y) to enhance Acquirors ability to get favorable regulatory and capital
credit or (z) to comply with applicable Law or rules of a national securities
exchange, and (iii) changes (such as the use of a depositary) that will not
materially affect the substantive terms of the security. The Perpetual
Preferred Stock will not be convertible into Acquiror Common Stock or any
other voting stock of the Acquiror will not contain voting rights other than
those contained in the Series C Preferred Stock and will not contain any terms
that would cause them to be deemed "voting securities" under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956 and any regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
applicable guidance or precedent of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.
