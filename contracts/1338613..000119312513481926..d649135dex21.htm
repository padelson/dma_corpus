mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or agreement. Any reference to any law will be deemed to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The

without the consent of Regency, HEP will not, and will not permit any of HEP&#146;s Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, engage in oil and natural gas gathering and transportation in Loving,
Pecos, Reeves and Ward Counties in the State of Texas (such activities are referred to collectively as the &#147;<U>Business</U>&#148;), or assist any Person to do the same. HEP acknowledges and agrees that the words &#147;directly or
indirectly&#148; include HEP or any of HEP&#146;s Affiliates competing individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person or as principal, agent, lender, creditor, advisor, consultant, owner, partner, independent contractor,
shareholder or in any manner whatsoever. As used herein, the term &#147;Affiliate&#148; of a Person means trust, corporation, general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or other entity controlled by, directly or indirectly,
such person. Control shall include being a manager, general partner, or similar position of authority with respect to such entity, or ownership of 5% or more of the voting equity interests in such entity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">4. <U>Covenant Not to Solicit Employees</U>. In addition, consistent with the foregoing, HEP further agrees that, effective as of the Closing
Date and for a period of one (1)&nbsp;year thereafter, HEP will not solicit or recruit for employment any Person who was as of the date of the execution and delivery of the Contribution Agreement or as of the Closing Date an employee of HEP or Staff
One HR, LLC or their respective Affiliates, to the extent such employee was employed in the Business, or otherwise solicit or induce any such Person to terminate his or her employment with the Hoover LLCs, Regency or its Affiliates (provided that
this sentence shall not prohibit placing advertisements in publications of general circulation that solicit employment and that are not specifically targeted to such persons and recruiting the persons who respond thereto). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. <U>Reasonableness and Opportunity to Consult With Counsel</U>. HEP acknowledges that this covenant not to compete is being provided as an
inducement to Regency and Regency Sub to acquire all of the membership interests in the Hoover LLCs and that this Agreement contains reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained that do not impose a
greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of Regency, Regency Sub and their Affiliates. The terms and scope of the covenants contained in Sections 3 and 4 are considered by the parties hereto to be
(i)&nbsp;fair, reasonable and necessary for the protection of the legitimate business interests of Regency, Regency Sub and their Affiliates and the conduct of the Business, (ii)&nbsp;not injurious to the public and (iii)&nbsp;appropriate based on
the nature of the Business. Regency and HEP have been represented by counsel throughout the negotiation of this Agreement (or have had the opportunity to be represented by counsel) and have had the opportunity to consult with counsel about every
provision of this Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">6. <U>Equitable Relief</U>. The parties mutually acknowledge and agree that if a violation of any covenant
contained in Section&nbsp;3 or 4 occurs, such violation may cause irreparable injury to Regency or its Affiliates and the remedy at law for any such violation will be inadequate. HEP agrees that, upon any breach or anticipated breach by HEP (or its
Affiliates) of any of such sections, Regency and its Affiliates will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction. Such equitable relief will be in addition to
any damages to which Regency and its Affiliates may be entitled. The provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of each such Section. Nothing in this provision or
this Agreement will limit any rights or remedies otherwise available to Regency and its Affiliates under federal, state or local law. </P>
