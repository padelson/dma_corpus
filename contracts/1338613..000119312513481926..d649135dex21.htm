-viii- _CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT_

 

This Contribution Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
December 22, 2013, by and among Hoover Energy Partners LP, a Delaware limited
partnership ("HEP"), Regency HEP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Regency Sub"), and Regency Energy Partners LP, a Delaware limited
partnership ("Regency").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, HEP desires to contribute to Regency Sub all of the membership
interests in Hoover Energy Texas LLC, Hoover Energy Texas Crude LLC, Hoover
Pecos River Limited Partner LLC and Hoover Pecos River General Partner LLC,
all Texas limited liability companies (collectively, the "Hoover LLCs");

WHEREAS, Regency Sub desires to accept all of the membership interests of
the Hoover LLCs and HEP has agreed to contribute all of those membership
interests to Regency Sub on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth; and

 

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, certain
executives of HEP have entered into Non-Competition Agreements with Regency
and Regency Sub.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

CONTRIBUTION

1.1 _Contribution of Equity_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, on the Closing Date, but effective for all purposes as of
11:59 p.m. on the last day of the month immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the "Effective Time"), HEP will contribute, convey and assign to Regency
Sub, and Regency Sub shall accept, all of the outstanding membership interests
of the Hoover LLCs (the "Interests").

 

1.2 _Payments on Closing Date; Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date, Regency
and Regency Sub will pay, or cause to be paid, to HEP, in consideration for
the Interests, an aggregate amount of $290,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"),
subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.3 of this Agreement. The Purchase
Price shall be payable at closing (i) by delivery of a cash amount from
Regency Sub equal to $192,000,000, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
1.3 (as so adjusted, the "Cash Purchase Price"), a portion of which Cash
Purchase Price shall be deposited in the Diamond Y Escrow Account at the
Closing as set forth in _Section 2.3_, and (ii) by issuance by Regency of
4,040,471 common units of Regency ("Common Units") valued for purposes of the
Purchase Price at $98,000,000 in the aggregate (such number of Common Units,
the "Purchase Price Units"), a portion of which Purchase Price Units shall be
deposited in the Escrow Account at the Closing as set forth in _Section 2.3_.

 



1 1.3 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Capex Amount" means the amount actually incurred by HEP, net of
reimbursables, from and after January 1, 2013 and on or before the Effective
Time on the capital expenditures set forth in Schedule 1.3(a)(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule, provided that, to the extent that such capital
expenditures are incurred after the date hereof, they are incurred
in accordance with Section 5.12 hereof. Prior to the Closing, the parties
shall agree on a schedule that sets forth the process by which the Estimated
Capex Amount shall be determined.

 

(ii) "Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital" means the amount equal to Current
Assets less Current Liabilities less any cash distributed to HEP pursuant to
Section 5.1(c) after the Effective Time but before Closing.

(iii) "Current Assets" means, as of the Effective Time, the current assets of
the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries, which will include, without limitation
(1) cash and cash equivalents, (2) receivables, (3) inventory and (4) other
current assets but expressly excluding any deferred Taxes.

(iv) "Current Liabilities" means, as of the Effective Time, the current
liabilities of the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries as determined in
accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures
("GAAP"), which will include, without limitation (1) accounts payable and
accrued liabilities (including but not limited to any liabilities for
retention bonuses or similar amount payable by the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions hereunder), and (2) other
current liabilities but expressly excluding any deferred Taxes.

(v) Current Assets and Current Liabilities, and each component of Current
Assets and Current Liabilities shall each be determined solely with respect to
the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied with the Balance Sheet and the notes thereto. The Consolidated
Adjusted Working Capital shall include such accounts as are customarily
included in the calculation of consolidated working capital under GAAP, and
such other accounts as may be agreed by the parties prior to Closing.

 

(vi) "Final Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital" means the Consolidated
Adjusted Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.3.

(b) No later than two (2) business days prior to the Closing, HEP shall
deliver HEPs reasonable estimate of (i) the Consolidated Adjusted Working
Capital (the "Estimated Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital") and (ii) the
Capex Amount (the "Estimated Capex Amount"), along with, in each
case, reasonable detail showing the determination thereof to Regency Sub, and
the amount to be paid at Closing shall be adjusted based on such estimates as
set forth in Section 1.3(c).

 



2 (c) The parties will make the following adjustments, as applicable, to the
Purchase Price at the Closing:

(i) in the event the Estimated Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital is less
than $0 (the "Target Working Capital"), the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the amount of the difference between the Estimated Consolidated Adjusted
Working Capital and the Target Working Capital; or

 

(ii) in the event the Estimated Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital is more
than the Target Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
amount of the difference between the Estimated Consolidated Adjusted Working
Capital and the Target Working Capital; and

 

(iii) in the event the Estimated Capex Amount is less than $30,900,000 (the
"Target Capex Amount"), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of
the difference between the Estimated Capex Amount and the Target Capex Amount;
or

 

(iv) in the event the Estimated Capex Amount is more than the Target Capex
Amount, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of the difference
between the Estimated Capex Amount and the Target Capex Amount.

(d) HEP and Regency Sub shall have up until ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date during which to verify the accuracy of the adjustments to the
Purchase Price based on the Estimated Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital
and Estimated Capex Amount. If neither notifies the other in writing within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date of any dispute with respect to such
adjustments, then such adjustments shall be conclusively considered to be true
and correct. If notice is timely given and Regency Sub and HEP are unable to
agree upon the determination of the Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to
Section 1.3(c) within sixty (60) days after that written notice is received,
an accounting firm selected in the manner hereinafter provided (the
"Accounting Firm") shall be requested to audit and determine such disputed
adjustments. The selection of the Accounting Firm shall be made by HEP from a
list of three nationally recognized independent accounting firms submitted by
Regency Sub. Each of HEP and Regency Sub shall provide the other with copies
of its relevant books and records and provide reasonable access to its
personnel as necessary to verify the accuracy of the applicable adjustments.

 

(e) Within thirty (30) days after the selection of the Accounting Firm,
Regency Sub and HEP shall each submit to the Accounting Firm (with a copy to
the other party) their respective proposals for the determination of the
disputed adjustments. Each proposal shall include all evidence and arguments
relied upon by the presenting party to support its conclusions. The Accounting
Firm shall schedule a hearing in Houston, Texas at a site mutually agreeable
to Regency Sub and HEP not later than twenty (20) days after receipt of the
last proposal. No less than seven (7) days prior to the hearing, each party
may submit additional information and arguments in response to the proposal
offered by the other side and the Accounting Firm may ask questions of the
parties.

 



3 (f) Within fifteen (15) days after the hearing, the Accounting Firm shall
choose the proposal of Regency Sub or HEP with respect to the adjustment to
the Purchase Price, which, based on the information and evidence presented,
the Accounting Firm determines is the better estimate of the applicable
adjustments (the "Final Adjustment" ). The Final Adjustment shall be final,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HEP

HEP hereby represents and warrants to Regency and Regency Sub, as of the date

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State

business as and where such properties are now owned or held and such business
is now conducted. HEP is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a
foreign limited partnership and is in good standing in the states in which the
character of the properties and assets now owned or held by it or the nature
of the business now conducted by it requires it to be so licensed or
qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. As used herein, "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean
any material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of

 



6  operations of the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any

the outbreak or escalation of hostilities or change in geopolitical

7  LLC owns beneficially and of record, free and clear of all Liens, all of the
general partner interests in each of the Subsidiaries, which in each case,

(iii) each other service provider benefit plan, agreement, arrangement,
program, practice, policy or understanding (whether written or otherwise). By
way of clarification, and not modification, of the foregoing, the Client
Service Agreement and any agreements between Staff One and any Current
Employee constitute Plans. A "Hoover Plan" is any Plan, including a Staff One
Plan, that is sponsored, maintained, administered, contributed to by or
required to be contributed to by any Hoover LLC and/or any Subsidiary or that
otherwise compensates or benefits any Current Employee. A "Transferred Plan"
is an HEP Plan that will, following the Closing, be sponsored, maintained or
administered by a Hoover LLC or a Subsidiary following the Closing and that
will not be, following the Closing, sponsored, maintained or administered by
HEP or any of its affiliates (other than the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries)
or by Staff One. A "Retained Plan" is an HEP Plan that is not a Transferred
Plan. "Staff One Plan" means any Plan that is

 



14  sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by
Staff One or with respect to which Staff One, or any trade or business
(whether or not incorporated) that together with Staff One is, or has been
within the past six years, required to be treated as a "single employer"
within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code, has or could have any
liability.

 

(b) With respect to each Hoover Plan, HEP has provided to Regency, as
applicable, and to the extent such documents with respect to the a Staff One
Plan are in its possession, (i) true, correct and complete copies of each of
the Hoover Plans, related trusts, insurance or group annuity contracts and
each other funding or financing arrangement relating to each Hoover Plan, if
applicable, including all amendments thereto, (ii) the three most recent
annual or other reports filed with each Governmental Authority including any
Form 5500 reports, (iii) the insurance contract and other funding agreement,
and all amendments thereto, (iv) the most recent summary plan description,
scheme booklet and all announcements, (v) the most recent audited accounts and
actuarial report or valuation required to be prepared under applicable Legal
Requirements and (vi) the most recent determination letter, advisory letter
or opinion letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service. With respect to each
Hoover Plan that is a Staff One Plan, HEP has (i) provided to Regency the most
recent summary plan description, scheme booklet and all applicable
announcements and (ii) taken commercially reasonable steps to obtain and to
provide to Regency (1) true, correct and complete copies of each such Hoover
Plan, related trusts, insurance or group annuity contracts and each other
funding or financing arrangement relating to each such Hoover Plan, if
applicable, including all amendments thereto, (2) the three most recent annual
or other reports filed with each Governmental Authority including any Form
5500 reports, (3) the insurance contract and other funding agreement, and all
amendments thereto, (4) the most recent audited accounts and actuarial report
or valuation required to be prepared under applicable Legal Requirements and
(5) the most recent determination letter, advisory letter or opinion letter
issued by the Internal Revenue Service. There are no unwritten Hoover Plans
other than a discretionary bonus plan with respect to which HEP has provided
the materials term in writing to Regency. A schedule of Hoover LLC and
Subsidiary expenses with respect to each Hoover Plan for the current plan year
and past plan year has been provided to Regency along with any administration
agreement associated with any Hoover Plan.

(c) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to any Hoover LLC or any Subsidiary, each Plan that is sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by HEP, any Hoover
LLC, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate or with respect to which any of the
foregoing has or could reasonably be expected to have any material liability
(an "HEP Plan") has been established and maintained in all respects in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with all applicable laws,
including but not limited to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA") and the Code. Except as could not reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability to any Hoover LLC or any
Subsidiary, each HEP Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code
(i) satisfies the requirements of such Sections in all material respects, (ii)
has obtained a favorable determination, notification, and advisory
and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status from the
United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), (iii) has been timely amended
as required by applicable Laws, and (iv) has not been amended or operated in a
way which would reasonably be expected to materially

 



15  adversely affect such qualified status. "ERISA Affiliate" means each trade
or business (whether or not incorporated) that together with HEP, any Hoover
LLC and/or any Subsidiary, as applicable, is, or has been within the past six
years, required to be treated as a "single employer" within the meaning of
Section 414 of the Code.

 

(d) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to any Hoover LLC or any Subsidiary, there are no actions, suits or
claims pending or, to the knowledge of HEP, threatened or reasonably
anticipated (other than routine claims for benefits) against, or with respect
to, any HEP Plan or against, or with respect to, the assets of any HEP Plan.

 

(e) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to any Hoover LLC or any Subsidiary, there is no matter pending

of the HEP Plans before any Governmental Authority.

 

(f) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to any Hoover LLC or Subsidiary, (i) none of HEP, any Hoover LLC,
any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, or is a successor or

in Section 4069 of ERISA; (ii) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
has not instituted proceedings to terminate any HEP Plan that is subject to
Section 206(g), 302, 303 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412, 430, 431, 436 or
4971 of the Code and no condition exists that could result in such proceedings
being instituted, and (iii) HEP has provided to Regency a true, correct and
complete copy of the most recently prepared actuarial valuation report for
each HEP Plan subject to Section 206(g), 302, 303 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412, 430, 431, 436 or 4971 of the Code, if applicable.

(g) No Hoover LLC or Subsidiary has or could reasonably be expected to have
any material liability with respect to and no HEP Plan is: (i) a plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (iii) except as set forth on Section
3.14(g)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule, a multiple employer plan as described
in Section 413(c) of the Code, (iv) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement"

beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code,

Code. No Transferred Plan is a multiple employer plan as described in Section
413(c) of the Code.

(h) No Hoover LLC or Subsidiary has or could reasonably be expected to have
any material liability with respect to any non-compliance with the
requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code and the corresponding provisions
of ERISA or similar state Law (collectively, "COBRA").

 

(i) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to any Hoover LLC or any Subsidiary, all contributions required to
be made to the HEP Plans pursuant to their terms and provisions or pursuant to
applicable Laws have been made timely.

 



16 (j) Each Transferred Plan that is an "employee benefit plan," as such term is
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA may be unilaterally amended or terminated in
its entirety by a Hoover LLC or a Subsidiary without material liability except
as to benefits accrued thereunder prior to such amendment or termination.

 

(k) None of HEP, the Hoover LLCs nor the Subsidiaries or employee of any of
the foregoing has, and to the knowledge of HEP, no other Person has, engaged
in or been a party to any act, omission or transaction which would reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to any Hoover LLC or any
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, for (i) breach of fiduciary duty damages
under Section 409 of ERISA, (ii) a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
subsections (c), (i) or (l) of Section 502 of ERISA or (iii) a tax imposed
pursuant to Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code.

 

(l) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to any Hoover LLC or Subsidiary, no HEP Plan provides, or reflects

LLC or Subsidiary is contractually or otherwise obligated (whether or not in
writing) to provide any Person with life insurance or medical benefits upon
retirement or termination of employment, except as may be required by COBRA.

any Hoover LLC or Subsidiary established any policy or practice, requiring it
to make a payment or provide any other form of compensation or benefit to any
person performing services for any Hoover LLC or Subsidiary upon termination
of such services which would not be payable or provided in the absence of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(o) No Hoover LLC or Subsidiary has or could reasonably be expected to have
any material liability to or with respect to compensation or benefits under
any Plan for Richard A. Hoover, Kristie Wetmore, Michael Forbau or Teresa
Morey.

(p) Except as specifically provided in Section 8 of this Agreement, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) constitute an event under any
Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in any payment (whether of
severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits
with respect to any current or former employee of or current or former
service provider to any Hoover LLC or any Subsidiary or (ii) require any
Hoover LLC or any Subsidiary to make a larger contribution to, or pay greater
benefits under any Plan than it otherwise would, whether or not some other
subsequent action or event would be required to cause such payment or
provision to be triggered.

time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default)
by them under or notice of termination of any Material Contract or Contributed
Contract. To the knowledge of HEP, there is no breach, anticipated breach or
default by any other party to any Material Contract or Contributed Contract.
The Hoover LLCs have made available to Regency prior to the date hereof a

interests by Right-of-Way, Contract or otherwise in and to all other material
Real Property interests that are necessary for each of the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries to conduct its business as currently being conducted, in each
case free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens or Liens
described in Section 3.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and other defects in
title or Liens which would not reasonably be expected to be material. All
leases for Real Property interests are valid and enforceable against the

may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (whether applied in a
proceeding at law or in equity). The Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries are in
material compliance with the terms of all such leases and there exist no
defaults by the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries or, to HEPs knowledge,
there exist no defaults by the counterparties to such leases or any facts
that would reasonably be expected to constitute a default with the passage of
time.

 



21 (b) Section 3.18(b) of the Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the date hereof,
(i) all of the easements, licenses, rights-of-way, permits, servitudes,

facilities (each, an "Easement"), (ii) the grantor and grantee of each

manner that such assets and properties are currently used and operated (or are

the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries are in material compliance with the terms
of the Easements and conduct their businesses in a manner that does not
materially violate any of the Easements, (iii) the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries have valid interest in the Easements, except as such interest
(or enforcement thereof) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity (whether
applied in a proceeding at law or in equity), (iv) except as disclosed in
Section 3.18(b) of the Disclosure Schedule as to (A) Easements which, by their
terms, obligate the Hoover LLCs and/or the Subsidiaries to make annual
payments for the use of the Easements and (B) current circumstances where, to
HEPs knowledge, the Hoover LLCs and/or the Subsidiaries may be obligated for
additional payments to a grantor of an Easement due to a determination that a
particular Easement contains more linear feet than that set forth in the
applicable Easement, as of the date hereof, the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries have materially fulfilled and performed their current obligations
with respect to the Easements, including the timely and full payment of all
amounts currently due and owing to the grantors of the Easements, and (v)
there are no existing material violations of the terms of the Easements by the
Hoover LLCs or the Subsidiaries and none of the Hoover LLCs or the
Subsidiaries has received written notice of the occurrence of any ongoing
event or circumstance that allows, or after the giving of notice or the
passage of time, or both, would allow limitation, revocation or termination
of any Easement or would result in any material impairment of the rights of
such Hoover LLC or Subsidiary in and to any such Easement. Except as shown in
Section 3.18(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, all pipelines operated by the
Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries are subject to Easements, and there are no
gaps (including any gap arising as a result of any breach by any of the Hoover
LLCs or any of the Subsidiaries of the terms of any Easement) in the
Easement, except where the presence of gaps, individually or in the
aggregate, (i) does not materially interfere with the ordinary conduct of the
business of the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries as presently conducted or
contemplated thereon, (ii) does not materially detract from the value or use
of the portion of the Easement which is affected by the gap as presently used
or contemplated to be used and (iii) are not material to the current or
contemplated operations of the Hoover LLCs and Subsidiaries. To the knowledge
of HEP, there is no breach, anticipated breach or default by any other party
to any Easement.

 

(c) With respect to leased Real Property, HEP has delivered or made available
to Regency true, complete and correct copies of any leases affecting the Real
Property. The Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries are not a sublessor or grantor
under any sublease or other instrument granting to any other person any right
to the possession, lease, occupancy or enjoyment of any leased Real Property.
The use and operation of the Real Property in the conduct of the business of
any of the Hoover LLCs or any of the Subsidiaries does not violate in

 



22  any material respect: (i) any applicable law, or (ii) with respect to owned
Real Property, any covenant, condition, restriction, easement, license, permit
or agreement or, (iii) with respect to leased Real Property, any covenant,
condition, restriction, easement, license, permit or agreement. There are no
actions, suits, investigations or proceedings pending nor, to HEPs knowledge,
threatened against or affecting the Real Property or any portion thereof or
interest therein in the nature or in lieu of condemnation or eminent domain
proceedings. HEP has provided to Regency copies of all title commitments and
policies obtained by HEP and currently in HEPs possession or any of the
Hoover LLCs or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to the owned Real
Property.

(d) All tangible personal property owned, leased or licensed by the Hoover
LLCs or the Subsidiaries that is material to the current or contemplated
operations of the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries is, taken as a whole, and

adequate for its present uses by the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries,
ordinary wear and tear excepted.

being contested in good faith by appropriate legal or administrative

use of property or other title matters (and with respect to leasehold

of the leased property, with or without consent of the lessee) that do not
adversely affect the current use of the property subject thereto,

 



23  none of which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the value of the asset subject
thereto or the operation of the asset as currently operated; and

(vii) Liens created by Regency or Regency Sub.

Regency Sub and HEP contained in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, respectively, are
satisfied timely, and in any event prior to the termination date set forth in
Section 10.1(b);

 

(ii) to otherwise consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

 

(iii) to avoid, remove and eliminate each and every impediment or objection
under any applicable law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority

effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or that could make the consummation of
the acquisition of the Interests in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful;

(iv) to defend all lawsuits and other proceedings by or before any
Governmental Authority or by any private party challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to

adverse effect on the business condition (financial or otherwise) of Regency,
its subsidiaries, the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Regency shall not be required to (A) consent
to the divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate (through

to any other structural or conduct remedy or enter into any settlement or
agree to any order regarding antitrust matters respecting the transactions

status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing to the other with true and

or Regency, as the case may be, or any of their respective subsidiaries, to
or from any third party or any Governmental Authority with respect thereto and
to permit the other to review in advance, to the extent practical, any
proposed communication by such party to any third party or Governmental
Authority.

5.6 _Intercompany Accounts and Contracts_. Prior to or on the Closing
Date (a) the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries shall pay all outstanding
payables owed to HEP or any of its affiliates (other than the Hoover LLCs and
the Subsidiaries), and (b) HEP and any of its affiliates (other than the
Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries) shall pay all outstanding payables owed to
the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries. All intercompany Contracts between HEP
and its affiliates, on one hand, and the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, shall terminate effective as of the Closing.

5.7 _Renaming_. At least five (5) days prior to Closing, Regency shall give
notice to HEP of new names for each of the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries,
which names shall not include the word "Hoover" and which names Regency has

Immediately prior to Closing, HEP shall cause each of the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries to file amendments to their certificates of formation with the
Secretary of State of the State of the Texas to change their names as
specified by Regency.

 

5.8 _Contribution_ At or prior to Closing, HEP shall contribute the assets and
obligations specifically listed on Section 5.8 of the Disclosure Schedule to
one or more of the Hoover LLCs or the Subsidiaries. The contribution shall be
made by documents or instruments reasonably satisfactory to Regency and
Regency Sub.

 

5.9 _Use of Name_. Upon the Closing, Regency and Regency Sub shall cease to
use the name "Hoover" with respect to any business activity of the Hoover
LLCs and the Subsidiaries. As promptly as practical but in any case within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Regency and Regency Sub shall (a)
have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to HEP,
and (b) shall remove any evidence of the word "Hoover" that appears on any
such assets or advertising materials (such as signage, pipeline markers,
vehicles, and equipment).

 



37 5.10 _Listing of Purchase Price Units_. Prior to the Closing, Regency shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of the New
York Stock Exchange for the listing of the Purchase Price Units thereon.

 

5.11 _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to take, or cause to take, all appropriate action and to do or cause
to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to make effective the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
and the Constituent Documents.

5.12 _Capital Expenditures_. From and after the date hereof, HEP shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue and effect the capital expenditures
set forth in Schedule 1.3(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules, provided that any
such capital expenditure or series of related capital expenditures in excess
of $100,000 shall require the prior consent of Regency in accordance with
Section 5.1(p) hereof. All such capital expenditures shall be incurred in a
commercially reasonable manner and in accordance with good industry practice.

 

5.13 _Diamond Y Remediation_. The parties acknowledge and agree that as a
result of historical discharges of substances into the environment on the
Diamond Y Property, there currently exists a hydrocarbon plume and associated
arsenic plume on such property as disclosed in Section 3.20 of the Disclosure
Schedule. HEP has undertaken certain remediation efforts with regard to such
plumes during its ownership of such property through its ownership of the
Hoover LLCs. After consummation of the transactions hereunder, Regency intends
to continue with such existing remediation efforts and shall be permitted to
undertake such additional remediation work as is required by law and such
additional work as Regency reasonably deems necessary and advisable and that
is contemplated by the Scope of Work. All such remediation work shall be
funded by disbursements from the Diamond Y Escrow Account until the earlier
of (i) the exhaustion of all funds in the Diamond Y Escrow Account or (ii) the
distribution of the remaining balance in the Diamond Y Escrow Account to HEP
on the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, in each case in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. As used herein, the term

denominated, including any interest, penalties or other additions to tax,
whether disputed or not, that may become payable in respect thereof, imposed
by any federal, state, local or foreign government or any agency or political
subdivision of any such government, which taxes shall include, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all income or profits taxes
(including, but not limited to, federal income taxes and state income taxes),

taxes, ad valorem taxes, property taxes, value-added taxes, franchise taxes,

described in clause (a) as a result of being a member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any Hoover LLC or Subsidiary
is or was a member prior to the Closing by reason of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6(a) or any similar foreign, state or local law; and (c) any
liability for the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (a)
or (b) as a result of the operation of law or any express or implied
obligation to indemnify any other person. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Returns" means all returns, exhibits, reports, estimates, declarations of
estimated tax, claims for refund, information statements and other
documentation (including any additional or supporting material) required to be
filed with a Governmental Authority in connection with any Taxes,
including information returns or reports with respect to backup withholding
and other payments to third parties, and including any schedules or
attachments thereto and any amendments thereof.

 

(b) HEP shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold Regency and its
affiliates harmless from (i) all Taxes due and owing by or with respect to,
and all Taxes imposed on or incurred by or with respect to each of the Hoover
LLCs, the Subsidiaries, the Hoover Assets or the Hoover Business (A) for any
taxable period ending on or before the Effective Time, (B) for any taxable
period beginning on or before and ending after the Effective Time (a "Straddle
Period"), the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Effective Time (the "Pre-Effective Time Tax Period"), and the
Taxes attributable to such period shall be determined pursuant to clause (e)
of this Section 7.1 and (C) income Taxes payable solely from the transfer of
the Interests from HEP to Regency Sub pursuant to this Agreement and (ii)
any Transfer Taxes that HEP is obligated to pay as set forth in clause (d) of
this Section 7.1; provided, however, HEP shall have no liability or obligation
for, and shall not indemnify or hold Regency and its affiliates harmless
from, (i) all Taxes due and owing by or with respect to, and all Taxes
imposed on or incurred by or with respect to each of the Hoover LLCs, the
Subsidiaries, the Hoover Assets or the Hoover Business (A) for any taxable
period beginning after the Effective Time (except for income Taxes payable
solely from the transfer of the Interests from HEP to

 



40  Regency Sub pursuant to this Agreement) and (B) for the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Effective Time (the "Post-Effective Time
Tax Period"), and (ii) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were taken into
account in the calculation of Final Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital, as
determined pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof.

 

(c) Regency shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold HEP and its
affiliates harmless from (i) any Taxes imposed on or incurred by or with
respect to the Hoover LLCs, the Subsidiaries, the Hoover Assets or the Hoover
Business (A) for any taxable period beginning after the Effective Time (except
for income Taxes payable solely from the transfer of the Interests from

Time Tax Period, and (ii) any Transfer Taxes that Regency is obligated to pay
as set forth in clause (d) of this Section 7.1.

Section 7.1 to determine the portion of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by,
or Tax refunds received with respect to, the Hoover LLCs, the Subsidiaries,
the Hoover Assets or the Hoover Business for a Straddle Period which is
allocable to the Pre-Effective Time Tax Period or the Post-Effective Time Tax
Period, the determination shall be made, in the case of property or ad valorem
taxes or franchise taxes (which are neither measured by nor based upon net
income), on a per diem basis and, in the case of other Taxes, and for the
avoidance of doubt, the Texas Margins Taxes, by assuming that the Pre-
Effective Time Tax Period constitutes a separate taxable period of the Hoover
LLCs or the Subsidiaries and by taking into account the actual taxable events
occurring during such period (except that exemptions, allowances and
deductions for a Straddle Period that are calculated on an annual or periodic
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned to the
Pre-Effective Time Tax Period ratably on a per diem basis). "Texas Margins
Tax" means the franchise tax imposed pursuant to Texas Tax Code §171.001 and
§171.0011, including that portion of the tax imposed on partnerships and
limited liability companies defined in 34 Texas Administrative Code §3.581.

 

(f) Regency agrees to pay to HEP any refund received after the Closing by
Regency or its affiliates, including for this purpose the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries, in respect of any Taxes attributable or paid with respect to any
taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Effective Time,
including a Pre-Effective Time Tax Period (except to the extent any such
refunds were taken into account in the calculation of Final Consolidated
Adjusted Working Capital, as determined pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof). HEP
agrees to pay to Regency any refund received after the Closing by HEP or its
affiliates, excluding for this purpose the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries,
in respect of any Taxes attributable or paid with respect to any taxable
period or portion thereof ending on or before the Effective Time, including a
Pre-Effective Time Tax Period (but only to the extent any such refunds were
taken into account in the calculation of Final Consolidated Adjusted Working
Capital, as determined pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof). The parties shall
cooperate to take all necessary steps to claim any such refund. Any such
refund received by a party or its affiliate for the account of the other party
shall be paid to such other party within fifteen (15) days after such refund
is received.

 



41 (g) Except as required by applicable law, Regency and HEP agree (i) that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be effective for Tax
purposes as of the Closing, (ii) to file all tax returns in a manner
consistent therewith, and (iii) not to make or cause any election to allocate
Tax items in a manner inconsistent with Section 7.1(e) hereof.

7.2 _Returns_.

 

(a) HEP shall have the right and obligation to timely prepare and file, and
cause to be timely prepared and filed, when due, any Return that is required
to include the operations, ownership, assets or activities of the Hoover LLCs
or the Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.
All such Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting
practices except as otherwise required by applicable law.

(b) Regency shall have the right and obligation to timely prepare and file,
and cause to be timely prepared and filed, when due (i) all Returns that are
required to include the operations, ownership, assets or activities of the
Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending after the Closing
Date (including Returns for any Straddle Period), excluding, however, any Tax
Returns required to be filed by HEP or any of its affiliates, excluding for
this purpose the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries, and (ii) all Returns for
Transfer Taxes arising as a result of the transactions effected pursuant to
this Agreement.

(c) Regency shall, with respect to any Return for which Regency is responsible
under Section 7.2(b) for preparing and filing, make such Return and related
workpapers available for review by HEP if the Return is with respect to Taxes
for which HEP may be liable (in whole or in part) hereunder or under
applicable law. Regency shall (i) make such Returns and workpapers available
to HEP for its review and reasonable comment not later than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing such Returns, and (ii) have such Returns
modified before filing to reflect reasonable comments requested by HEP unless
such comments are contrary to the provisions of Section 7.2(d) hereof. Regency
will timely pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due on such Return. Not
later than five (5) days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with
respect to any such Return, HEP will pay to (or at the direction of) Regency
the portion of any Taxes shown as due on such Return for which HEP is liable
for, as determined pursuant to  _Section 7.1(e)_, to the extent such amount
exceeds the amount taken into account in the calculation of Final Consolidated
Adjusted Working Capital, as determined pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof;
provided, however, HEP shall not be required to pay any such Taxes prior to
five (5) days following the date on which Regency delivers to HEP schedules
and other details supporting the calculation of the amount payable by HEP
pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_.

 

(d) Any Return which includes or is based on the operations, ownership, assets
or activities of the Hoover LLCs or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period
that includes the Closing Date, including any Straddle Period, and any Return
in respect of any Taxes for which HEP may be liable (in whole or in part)
hereunder shall be prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting practices
used with respect to the Returns in question (unless such past

 



42  practices are no longer permissible under the applicable law), and to the
extent any items are not covered by past practices (or in the event such past
practices are no longer permissible under the applicable Tax law), in
accordance with reasonable Tax accounting practices selected by the filing
party with respect to such Return under this Agreement with the consent (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the non-filing party.

 

(e) HEP shall prepare and provide to Regency such information as is reasonably
requested by Regency with respect to the operations, ownership, assets or
activities of the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries for the Pre-Effective Time
Tax Period to the extent such information is relevant to any Return which
Regency has the right and obligation hereunder to file.

 

(f) Unless required by applicable law, Regency shall not file an amended
Return related to the Hoover LLCs or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date without the
consent of HEP, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

7.3 _Tax Proceedings_. If Regency or any of its affiliates receives notice
(the "Proceeding Notice") of any examination, claim, adjustment, or other
proceeding with respect to the liability of the Hoover LLCs or the
Subsidiaries for Taxes for any period for which HEP is or may be liable under
this Agreement, Regency shall notify HEP in writing thereof (the
"Regency Notice") no later than twenty (20) days prior to the deadline for
responding to the Proceeding Notice; provided, however, that if Regency
receives the Proceeding Notice with less than those twenty (20) days prior to
the deadline, Regency shall notify HEP no later than five (5) days after the
receipt by Regency or any of its affiliates of the Proceeding Notice, but in
no case less than two (2) days prior to such deadline. Such Regency Notice
shall be accompanied by copies of any notice and other documents received
from any taxing authority with respect to such matter. As to any such Taxes
for which HEP is or may be liable under this Agreement, HEP shall be entitled
at its expense to control or settle the contest of such examination, claim,
adjustment, or other proceeding, provided (i) HEP notifies Regency in writing
that it desires to do so no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the deadline
for responding to the Proceeding Notice (provided, however, that if fifteen
(15) days do not exist prior to the deadline after HEPs receipt of the
Regency Notice, HEP shall notify Regency no later than five (5) days after
receipt of the Regency Notice, but in no case less than one (1) day prior to
such deadline), and (ii) HEP may not, without the consent of Regency, not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, agree to any settlement
which would result in an increase in the amount of Taxes for which Regency is
liable under Section 7.1(c), and (iii) HEP shall keep Regency reasonably
informed of such examination, claim, adjustment or proceeding and shall
provide Regency, in a timely manner, with copies of all relevant
documents and correspondence relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Regency Notice is given to HEP pursuant to this Section 7.3 and HEP
does not notify Regency of its intent to control or settle the proceeding
pursuant to this Section 7.3, then (i) Regency shall be entitled at its
expense to control or settle the contest of such examination, claim,
adjustment or other proceeding and Regency shall keep HEP reasonably informed
of such examination, claim, adjustment or proceeding and shall provide HEP,
in a timely manner, with copies of all relevant documents and correspondence
relating thereto, and (ii) HEP shall be bound by any determination made in
such proceeding or any compromise or settlement thereof effected by

 



43  Regency. The parties shall cooperate with each other and with their
respective affiliates, and shall consult with each other, in the negotiation
and settlement of any proceeding described in this Section 7.3. Regency will
provide, or cause to be provided, to HEP necessary authorizations, including
powers of attorney, to control any proceedings which HEP is entitled to
control pursuant to this Section 7.3.

 

7.4 _Payment of Taxes_. All Taxes with respect to the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries shall be remitted timely to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by the party that is responsible for preparing and filing the
related Returns as provided in Section 7.2; provided, however, HEP shall have
no obligation to remit any Taxes for which Regency is liable pursuant to
this Article 7 or any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were taken into account
in the calculation of Final Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital, as
determined pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof. Except as otherwise provided in
this Article 7, any amount to which a party is entitled to recovery or
reimbursement under this Article 7 shall be promptly paid to such party by the
party obligated to make such payment following written notice to the party so
obligated stating that the Taxes to which such amount relates have been paid
or incurred and providing details supporting the calculation of such amount.

7.5 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information With Respect to Tax Issues_.
Regency and HEP will provide, or cause to be provided, to the other party
copies of all correspondence received from any Governmental Authority by such
party or any of its affiliates in connection with the liability of the Hoover
LLCs and the Subsidiaries for Taxes for any period for which such other party
is or may be liable under clause (b), (c) or (d) of Section 7.1. The parties
will provide each other with such cooperation and information as they may
reasonably request of each other in preparing or filing any Return, amended
Return, or claim for refund, in determining a liability or a right of refund,
or in conducting any audit or other proceeding, in respect of Taxes imposed
on the parties or their respective affiliates. Regency and HEP will preserve
and retain all Returns, schedules, workpapers and all material records or
other documents relating to any such Returns, claims, audits, or
other proceedings until the expiration of the statutory period of limitations
(including extensions) of the taxable periods to which such documents relate
and until the final determination of any payments which may be required with
respect to such periods under this Agreement and shall make such documents
available at the then current administrative headquarters of such party to the
other party or any affiliate thereof, and their respective officers, employees
and agents, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, it being
understood that such representatives shall be entitled to make copies of any
such books and records relating to the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries as
they shall deem necessary. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section
7.5 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Returns or claims for refund or in conducting
any audit or other proceeding. Each party shall provide the cooperation
and information required by this Section 7.5 at its own expense.

7.6 _Tax Treatment of the Sale and Allocation of Purchase Price_. 

(a) HEP, Regency and Regency Sub intend (i) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, to treat the transfer of the Interests to Regency Sub in accordance
with the Treasury Regulations under Section 707 of the Code as (A) a sale by
HEP of a portion of the Hoover Assets to Regency in exchange for the Cash
Purchase Price and (B) a contribution by HEP of a 

 



44  portion of the Hoover Assets to Regency in exchange for the Purchase Price
Units in a transaction qualifying under Section 721 of the Code (the "Intended
Tax Treatment"), and (ii) unless otherwise required by applicable Law, to
timely and properly report, and to cause each of their owners and Affiliates
to report, the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
Intended Tax Treatment for all U.S. federal (and any applicable state and
local) income Tax purposes.

(b) The Cash Purchase Price (and any other item of consideration for
purposes of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and including any adjustment to the Purchase Price or any such
other item of consideration), shall be allocated among the assets of the
Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 7.6 of the
Disclosure Schedule and Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Within sixty (60) days after the determination of
Final Consolidated Adjusted Working Capital as determined under Section 1.3,
or, if sooner, sixty (60) days before (taking into account all applicable
extensions) Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 reporting the transactions
contemplated hereby must be filed, HEP will provide to Regency copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto (the
"Allocation") with HEPs proposed allocation of the Cash Purchase Price
consistent with Section 7.6 of the Disclosure Schedule and Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Within thirty
(30) days after the receipt of such Allocation, Regency will submit to HEP any
proposed changes to such Allocation or shall indicate its concurrence
therewith, which concurrence shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed (and in the event no such changes are proposed in writing to HEP
within such period of time, Regency will be deemed to have agreed to,
and accepted, the Allocation). Regency and HEP will endeavor in good faith to
resolve any differences with respect to the Allocation within fifteen (15)
days after HEPs receipt of written notice of objection from Regency. In the
event Regency and HEP are unable to resolve all differences with respect to
the Allocation within such fifteen (15) day period, each of Regency and HEP
may file its respective Returns reflecting such allocation as it determines in
its sole discretion to be appropriate; provided, however, all such
allocations and all such Tax Returns shall be consistent with the Agreed Tax
Treatment.

7.7  _Tax Treatment of Escrow Amount and the Diamond Y Escrow Account_. For
federal income Tax purposes, HEP shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow
Units, plus any cash distributions attributable to the Escrow Units
(collectively, the "Escrow Amount") held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement and Regency shall be treated as the owner of all amounts held
in the Diamond Y Escrow Account. Accordingly, HEP shall include in taxable
income all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit allocable with
respect to such Purchase Price Units during the period such units are held by
the Escrow Agent. Any cash or other property received by the Escrow Agent with
respect to such Purchase Price Units or the amounts held in the Diamond Y
Escrow Account shall become part of the applicable escrow, and shall not be
distributed by the Escrow Agent except in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, but shall be treated for tax purposes as being paid to HEP
or Regency, as applicable.

7.8 _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
Article 7 and any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this
Article 7 shall control.

 



45 ARTICLE 8

 

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

 

8.1 _Status of Employees_.

 

(a) Subject to Regencys drug and other employment screening procedures and
hiring policies, Regency (or its general partner, Regency Sub or other
subsidiary) shall offer employment to the Administrative Employees not
receiving long-term disability benefits ("Active Administrative Employees") at
the same or better levels of base compensation as such Active
Administrative Employees were receiving from HEP as of the date hereof.
Active Administrative Employees who (i) timely accept Regencys offers of
employment under the terms provided herein, and (ii) on the Closing Date, are
actively at work or on wellness or sickness leave, short-term disability or
any other approved leave of absence, shall be referred to herein as
"Transferred Employees."

 

(b) For the period from the Closing until the first anniversary date thereof,
Regency shall cause the Hoover LLCs, the Subsidiaries or another affiliate of
Regency to provide the Field Employees and any Transferred Employees
(collectively, the "New Regency Employees") with compensation and benefits
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those currently being
provided to the New Regency Employees by HEP or Staff One as of the date
hereof and, in any event, are in compliance with applicable law.

 

8.2 _Employee Related Matters_.

 

(a) No more than 10 days following the date on which the parties have received
approval under the HSR Act, HEP shall provide the Current Employee
Information in writing to Regency with respect to each Current Employee. HEP
shall provide updated Current Employee Information to Regency through the
Closing as such information changes. "Current Employee Information" means,
with respect to a Current Employee, (i) name; (ii) title or position
(including whether full or part time); (iii) job description; (iv) hire date;
(v) principal work location; (vi) average number of hours regularly
scheduled to work each week in the twelve (12) month period prior to the date
of this Agreement and the number of hours regularly scheduled to work each
week as of the date hereof; (vii) base salary or hourly wage as applicable
and, in case of hourly wages, the number of hours per week such Current
Employee is regularly scheduled to work; (viii) the date and amount of each
Current Employees last raise; (ix) description of commission, bonus or other
incentive-based compensation arrangement applicable to such Current Employee,
including, but not limited to, the target payment amount for the current year,
the amount payable during the one-year period immediately preceding the date
hereof; and the amount accrued and paid in the current year as of the date
hereof; (x) the number of years of service credit under each applicable Hoover
Plan; (xi) whether or not such Current Employee is currently active at work
and, if not, the date that absence began, whether such absence is permitted
and, if so, the policy permitting such absence, the nature of such absence,
expected duration of such absence, and the date upon which such Current
Employee is currently expected to return to work; (xii) identification of
each Hoover Plan to be taken into account in determining the Current
Employees benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits provided

  



46  as in effect on the date hereof; and (xiii) the accrued but untaken vacation
credited to the Current Employee under HEPs applicable vacation plans and the
rate of accrual of hours of vacation or other paid-time-off with respect to
such Current Employee to be taken into account in determining Regencys
obligations relating to vacation and other paid-time-off with respect to such
Current Employee.

 

(b) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, HEP shall terminate or cause
to be terminated the employment of all Current Employees with Staff One and
HEP, as applicable, and shall ensure that no Current Employees shall actively
participate in any Retained Plan. HEP shall ensure that none of Regency or any
of its affiliates (including the Hoover LLCs and Subsidiaries) shall have
any obligations or any liability with respect to any Retained Plans.

(c) HEP shall take such actions as necessary to ensure that as of and after
the Closing (i) no employees other than the New Regency Employees shall
participate in any Transferred Plan and only the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries shall sponsor, maintain, administer or be adopting employers of
the Transferred Plans and (ii) no New Regency Employees shall actively
participate in any Retained Plan and none of Regency, the Hoover LLCs, the
Subsidiaries or any affiliate of any of the foregoing shall sponsor, maintain,
administer or be an adopting employer of any Retained Plan. Regency shall
take or cause its affiliates to take such commercially reasonable actions as
may be necessary to cause the 401(k) plan of Regency or its affiliates as may
exist as of the Closing to accept (if permitted pursuant to the terms of such
401(k) plan of Regency or its affiliates, provided that Regency shall take
such commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary to amend such 401(k)
plan to permit such rollovers) a direct rollover of a New Regency Employees
balance (including any plan loans) under the Staff One 401(k) Plan, to the
extent elected by the employee.

(d) Following the Closing, with respect to each applicable Plan of the Hoover
LLCs, the Subsidiaries, Regency or any of its affiliates ("Regency Plan"),
Regency shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, take commercially reasonable
steps to ensure that each New Regency Employee shall be given credit under
such Regency Plan for all service prior to the Closing Date with the Hoover
LLCs, the Subsidiaries or any predecessor employer thereto (to the extent such
credit was given by HEP or its affiliates, the Hoover LLCs, a Subsidiary or
any predecessor employer thereto under a comparable Plan), for purposes of
eligibility and vesting, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law
and to the extent such information is timely and correctly provided in the
Current Employee Information; provided, however, such service need not be
credited to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(e) Effective as of the Closing, Regency shall take commercially reasonable
steps to offer coverage under the welfare benefit plans of Regency or its
affiliates as may exist at such time (the "Regency Welfare Plans") to the New
Regency Employees and their eligible dependents. Claims for such benefits by
New Regency Employees with respect to purchases, services or
treatment rendered on or subsequent to the Closing shall be covered by
Regency Welfare Plans in accordance with the terms of such plans and not by
HEP Plans. Claims for welfare benefits by New Regency Employees with respect
to purchases, services or treatment rendered prior to the Closing shall be
covered by HEPs or its affiliates existing welfare plans (the "HEP Welfare
Plans") in

 



47  accordance with the terms of such HEP Welfare Plans, and not by Regency
Welfare Plans. Regency shall take commercially reasonable steps to cause the
New Regency Employees to be granted credit under Regency Welfare Plans that
are group health plans, for the year during which the Closing occurs, against
the deductibles, co-payment limits and out-of-pocket limits of the Regency
Welfare Plans for the covered expenses already incurred by such New Regency
Employees during such year under the comparable HEP Welfare Plans in which
such New Regency Employees participate at the Closing Date, but only to the
extent permitted by applicable law and by third-party insurers and
administrators and only to the extent such actions would not result in
material additional costs to Regency and would not result in a loss of any
"grandfathered" status of any applicable Regency Welfare Plan. In addition,
Regency shall take commercially reasonable steps to cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods and pre-existing condition limitations or
restrictions under Regency Welfare Plans that are group health plans to the
extent necessary to provide immediate coverage of New Regency Employees and
their covered dependents under such welfare plans as of the Closing Date (but
only to the extent that coverage was provided under the applicable HEP Welfare
Plans), but only to the extent permitted by applicable law and by third-party
insurers and administrators and only to the extent such actions would not
result in material additional costs to Regency and would not result in a loss
of any "grandfathered" status of any applicable Regency Welfare Plan.

 

(f) As of the Closing, Regency shall establish flexible spending accounts for
medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan (the
"Regencys FSA") for each New Regency Employee who, on or prior to the Closing
Date, is a participant in a flexible spending account for medical and
dependent care expenses under a Plan (the "HEPs FSA") or who elects to
participate in Regencys FSA. Regency shall credit or debit, as applicable,
effective as of the Closing Date, the applicable account of each New Regency
Employee under Regencys FSA with an amount equal to the balance of each such
New Regency Employees account under HEPs FSA as of immediately prior to the
Closing. Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, HEP shall pay to
Regency the net aggregate amount of the account balances credited
under Regencys FSA if such amount is positive, and Regency shall pay to HEP
the net aggregate amount of the account balances credited under Regencys FSA
if such amount is negative. Thereafter, Regencys FSA shall be responsible for
all claims incurred by New Regency Employees in the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs. The parties agree to cooperate to ensure that there is no
gap, lapse, overlap or duplication in the flexible spending benefits coverage
of the New Regency Employees.

(g) So long as HEP or any affiliate of HEP that would be in a "selling group"
(determined pursuant to Q/A 3 of Treas. Reg. §54.4980B-9) with HEP maintains
a group health plan after the Closing, HEP shall be responsible for all
obligations and liabilities with respect to the continuation coverage
requirements of COBRA for all employees of HEP and its affiliates (and their
dependents and beneficiaries) who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" pursuant
to Q/A 4 of Treas. Reg. §54.4980B-9 as a result of the transactions
consummated pursuant to this Agreement. If none of HEP or any of its
affiliates provides a group health plan after the Closing, Regency, if it
maintains a group health plan at such time, shall be responsible for all such
obligations and liabilities pursuant to Q/A 8(c) of Treas. Regs. §54.4980B-9
with respect to "MandA qualified beneficiaries" pursuant to Q/A 4 of Treas.
Reg. §54.4980B-9 as a result of the transactions consummated pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that HEP shall indemnify and hold Regency and
its affiliates harmless with respect to all such obligations and liabilities.

 



48 (h) For the period from the Closing until the first anniversary date thereof,
if Regency terminates the employment of any New Regency Employee, other than
for cause (as determined by Regency in its sole, good faith discretion), or if
Regency requires as a condition of any New Regency Employees continued
employment with Regency that the New Regency Employee relocate to a location
more than fifty (50) miles from that New Regency Employees current, customary
location of employment with HEP and, as a result, such New Regency Employees
employment terminates, Regency covenants and agrees that Regency shall pay
severance pay (based on such New Regency Employees tenure with HEP, the
Hoover LLCs and/or the Subsidiaries and exclusive of service to prior
owners/employers) to that New Regency Employee in such amount as provided
pursuant to any applicable severance benefit plan or plans of Regency or its
affiliates for similarly situated employees of Regency or its affiliates. HEP
shall be responsible and assumes all liabilities for all notices and payments
due to any employee of the Hoover LLCs or the Subsidiaries terminated, or
given notice of termination, with respect to events occurring on or prior to
the Closing, pursuant to agreements, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or other applicable law.

(i) HEP shall be responsible for payment of all of HEPs obligations to the
New Regency Employees with respect to the periods on and prior to the
Closing, including salaries, wages, bonuses, payroll Taxes, retirement, and
any other claims, obligations and expenses of any kind arising out of the
employment by, or termination from the employment of, HEP. Neither Regency
nor its affiliates will be responsible for any severance payable to any
Current Employee resulting from the termination of such employees employment
with HEP, Staff One or affiliates of any of the foregoing. Neither Regency
nor its affiliates will be responsible for any salaries, wages, bonuses,
payroll Taxes, retirement, and any other claims, obligations and expenses of
any kind arising out of the employment of, or termination of the employment
of, Richard A. Hoover, Kristie Wetmore, Michael Forbau or Teresa Morey.

(j) From and after the Closing, Regency shall be responsible for, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the HEP Parties from and against, any and
all claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) and other liabilities and obligations relating to or arising out of
any claims of, or damages or penalties sought by, any New Regency Employee,
or any Governmental Authority on behalf of or concerning any New Regency
Employee, with respect to any act or failure to act by Regency or its
affiliates to the extent arising from the employment, discharge, layoff,
termination or constructive termination of any New Regency Employee with
respect to Regency following the Closing.

 

(k) All accrued and unused paid time off entitlement of the New Regency
Employees as of the Closing Date shall be recognized following the Closing by
Regency, the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries, and New Regency Employees shall
be allowed to use such entitlement on terms comparable to the paid time off
policies of the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries immediately prior to
Closing; provided, that such information is timely and correctly provided as
part of the Current Employee Information.

 



49 (l) HEP, the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries have set and will pay retention
bonuses to Current Employees (i.e., bonuses recognizing continued employment
through the date of the Closing). Such bonuses shall be paid by HEP within 10
days following the Closing Date to those Current Employees who remain employed
through such date in amounts equal to the amounts payable under the terms of
the applicable retention bonus arrangement. Regency, Regency Sub, the Hoover
LLCs and the Subsidiaries shall have no responsibility or liability with
respect to such retention bonuses and HEP shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Regency Parties with respect thereto.

(m) Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to prevent, restrict,
or limit Regency Sub, the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries following the
Closing from modifying or terminating any of its Plans or any Transferred Plan
from time to time as it may deem appropriate.

 

8.3 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Article 8 are for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give
to any person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any New Regency Employee
or other current or former employee of or service provider to HEP, any Hoover
LLC, any Subsidiary or any of their respective affiliates, other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the
matters provided for in this Article 8) under or by reason of any provision
of this Agreement. Nothing in this Article 8 shall create, amend, or terminate
or be deemed to create, amend or terminate (or prevent the amendment or
termination of) any Plan or any compensation or benefit plan of HEP, any
Hoover LLC, any Subsidiary or Regency or any of their respective affiliates.
As between Regency and each New Regency Employee, Regency shall have no
obligation to continue to employ or retain the services of any New Regency
Employee for any period of time following the Closing and Regency shall be
entitled to modify any compensation or benefits provided to, and any other
terms or conditions of employment of, any such employees in its
absolute discretion. Nothing contained in this Agreement or resulting from
the transactions contemplated hereunder shall or shall be deemed to create a
contract of employment between Regency and its affiliates, on the one hand,
and any New Regency Employee, on the other hand, and all New Regency
Employees shall be regarded as "at will" employees of Regency and its
affiliates for all purposes.

 

ARTICLE 9

shall terminate, except for (a) representations and warranties in Section 3.12
(Taxes), which shall continue in effect until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations plus ninety (90) days, and (b)
representations and warranties in Section 3.1 (HEPs Organization and

9.3 _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_. Regency and Regency Sub acknowledge
that the assets of the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries have been used for
the gathering and transportation of oil, gas, condensate and other gaseous and
liquid hydrocarbons or any combination thereof and sulphur, carbon dioxide or
other materials extracted from hydrocarbons (collectively, "Hydrocarbons")
and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other substances
or materials located in, on, under or associated with such assets. Equipment
and sites included in such assets may contain Hazardous Materials or
naturally occurring radioactive material ("NORM"). NORM may affix or attach
itself to the inside of pipes, materials and equipment as scale, or in other
forms. The pipes, materials, and equipment included in such assets may
contain NORM and other Hazardous Materials. NORM-containing material and/or
other Hazardous Materials may have come into contact with various
environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils or
sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation,
removal, transportation, or disposal of environmental media, wastes, Hazardous
Materials and NORM from such Assets.

 

9.4 _The Companies, Regency and Regency Sub Release_. Effective on and as of
the Closing, Regency, on behalf of itself, Regency Sub, the Hoover LLCs, the
Subsidiaries and Regencys affiliates and its and their respective successors
and assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably release, waive and forever
discharge HEP, its partners and each of their respective affiliates (other
than the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries), together with all of their
respective past and present agents, employees, representatives, officers,
directors, partners and managers, and the heirs, successors and assigns of all
of the foregoing (collectively, the "HEP Released Parties") from, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the HEP Released Parties with respect to, any and
all agreements, arrangements, debts, liabilities, claims, demands, losses,
actions and causes of action, suits, judgments and controversies of any kind
whatsoever (whether known or unknown, contingent or fixed, accrued or
unaccrued) in connection with or otherwise related to the Hoover LLCs, the
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses (other than claims by Regency or
Regency Sub for indemnification which Regency or Regency Sub is entitled to
make pursuant to Article 11 and the indemnification provided for in

 



51  Sections 7.1(b) and 9.5 or for any liabilities or obligations of HEP under
each other agreement, instrument, or document executed by HEP in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (collectively, the "HEP
Released Claims") that Regency, Regency Sub, the Hoover LLCs, the Subsidiaries
and their affiliates have or claims to have now or arising in the future out
of events or circumstances accruing on or before the Closing Date against any
or all of the HEP Released Parties; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 9.4 will limit the ability of Regency or its affiliates to defend a
claim brought by a third party by taking the position that such claim should
be against one or more HEP Released Parties rather than Regency or its
affiliates. Regency, on behalf of itself, Regency Sub, the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries further agrees that none of those entities will file or bring any
claim, suit, action, complaint or arbitration with respect to any HEP
Released Claim and Regency agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
HEP Released Parties from any HEP Released Claims brought by Regency Sub, the
Hoover LLCs, the Subsidiaries or their affiliates or any of their respective
officers, employees, agents, consultants or representatives.

9.5 _HEP s Release_. Effective on and as of the Closing, HEP, for itself and
its affiliates (other than the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries) and its and
their respective successors and assigns, hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably release, waive and forever discharge Regency, Regency Sub, the
Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries, their respective members, partners and
shareholders and each of their respective affiliates, together with all of
their respective past and present agents, employees, representatives,
officers, directors and managers, and the heirs, successors and assigns of all
of the foregoing (collectively, the "Regency Released Parties") from, and

to, any and all agreements, arrangements, debts, liabilities, claims, demands,
losses, actions and causes of action, suits, judgments and controversies of
any kind whatsoever (whether known or unknown, contingent or fixed, accrued
or unaccrued) in connection with or otherwise related to the Hoover LLCs, the
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses (other than claims by HEP for
indemnification which HEP is entitled to make pursuant to Article 11 and the
indemnification provided for in Sections 7.1(c) and 9.4 or for any

by this Agreement) (collectively, the "Regency Released Claims") that HEP or
any of its affiliates (other than the Hoover LLCs or the Subsidiaries) has or
claims to have now or arising in the future out of events or circumstances
accruing on or before the Closing Date against any or all of Regency Released
Parties; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 9.5 will limit the
ability of HEP or its affiliates to defend a claim brought by a third party by
taking the position that such claim should be against one or more Regency
Released Parties rather than HEP or its Affiliates. HEP further agrees not to
file or bring any claim, suit, action, complaint or arbitration with respect
to any Regency Released Claim and HEP agrees to indemnify, defend and

10.1 _Events of Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of Regency and HEP; 

(b) by either Regency or HEP in writing after April 1, 2014, if the Closing
has not occurred by such date, provided that as of such date the terminating
party is not in default under this Agreement; or

(c) by either Regency or HEP in writing without prejudice to other rights and
remedies which the terminating party or its affiliates may have (provided the
terminating party and its affiliates are not otherwise in material default or
breach of this Agreement, or have not failed or refused to close
without justification hereunder), if the other party or its affiliates has
(i) materially failed to perform its covenants or agreements contained herein
required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) materially
breached any of its representations or warranties contained herein; provided,
however, that in the case of clause (i) or (ii), the defaulting party shall
have a period of ten (10) days following written notice from the nondefaulting
party to cure any breach of this Agreement, if such breach is curable; or

(d) by either Regency or HEP in writing, without liability, if there shall be
any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental or
regulatory agency binding on Regency or HEP, which prohibits or restrains
Regency or HEP from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby,
provided that the terminating party shall have used their commercially
reasonable efforts to have any such order, writ, injunction or decree lifted
and the same shall not have been lifted within thirty (30) days after entry by
any such court or governmental or regulatory agency. 

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by a party, as provided in Section 10.1 above, this Agreement shall
thereafter become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any
party hereto or their respective directors, partners, officers, shareholders
or agents, except as provided in Section 12.1 hereof and except that any such
termination shall be without prejudice to the rights of any party hereto
arising out of the material breach by any other party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

 

10.3 _Specific Performance_. Regency and Regency Sub agree that money damages
may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that HEP
shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive or other
equitable relief as a remedy for Regency or Regency Subs breach of this
Agreement. In no case shall HEP be required to post any bond in
connection with any injunctive relief.

 



53 ARTICLE 11

 

INDEMNIFICATION

11.1  _Indemnification of HEP by Regency and Regency Sub_. Subject to the
limitations set forth herein, Regency and Regency Sub, jointly and severally,
from and after the Closing Date, shall indemnify and hold HEP and their
affiliates and their respective equity owners, directors, managers, officers,
employees, agents and representatives, (together with HEP, the "HEP Parties")
harmless from and against any and all damages (including exemplary damages and
penalties), losses, deficiencies, costs, expenses, obligations, fines,
expenditures, claims and liabilities, including reasonable counsel fees and
reasonable expenses of investigation, defending and prosecuting litigation
(collectively, the "Damages"), suffered by HEP Parties as a result of, caused
by, arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) any breach of a
representation or warranty by Regency or Regency Sub in this Agreement and the
Constituent Documents to which it is a party (solely for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty
and/or for purposes of determining the amount of any Damages, no effect will
be given to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or similar
qualification contained in such representations and warranties), (b) any
nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Regency or Regency Sub under
this Agreement and the Constituent Documents to which it is a party, (c) any
due diligence activity conducted by Regency or Regency Sub or their
respective agents with respect to the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries,
whether before or after the execution of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Damages resulting, in whole or in part, from the negligence or
strict liability of HEP, but excluding any Damages to the extent directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the HEP Parties, and
(d) certain matters as set forth in Article 7, Article 8 and Section 9.3 of
this Agreement.

11.2 _Indemnification of Regency and Regency Sub by HEP_. Subject to
the limitations set forth herein, HEP, from and after the Closing Date, shall
indemnify and hold Regency, Regency Sub and their respective affiliates and
their respective equity owners, directors, managers, officers, employees,
agents and representatives (together with Regency and Regency Sub, the
"Regency Parties") harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered by
the Regency Parties as a result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way
relating to (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of HEP in this
Agreement and the Constituent Documents to which it is a party (solely for
purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any representation
or warranty and/or for purposes of determining the amount of any Damages, no
effect will be given to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or similar
qualification contained in such representations and warranties), (b) any
nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant on the part of HEP under this
Agreement and the Constituent Documents to which it is a party, (c)
remediation costs associated with the Diamond Y Property incurred by any
Regency Party within two (2) years after the Closing Date in accordance with
the terms of Section 5.13 hereof, and (d) certain matters as set forth in
Article 7, Article 8 and Section 9.4 of this Agreement.

 

11.3 _Demands_. Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its
discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions
of this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion,
claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (a
"Third Party Claim"), with respect to 

 



54  any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the
provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in writing to
the indemnifying party, stating the amount of Damages, if known, and method
of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity, and stating with
reasonable particularity the nature of the matter and basis of the claim for
indemnity under this Agreement. The indemnifying party shall not be obligated
to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to any Third Party Claim if
the indemnified party failed to notify the indemnifying party thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in sufficient time to permit
the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend against such matter and to
make a timely response thereto including, without limitation, any responsive
motion or answer to a complaint, petition, notice or other legal, equitable or
administrative process relating to such Third Party Claim, but only insofar
as such knowing failure to notify the indemnifying party has actually resulted
in prejudice or damage to the indemnifying party.

 

11.4 _Right to Contest and Defend_. The indemnifying party shall be entitled
at its cost and expense to contest and defend by all appropriate legal
proceedings any Third Party Claim with respect to which it is called upon to
indemnify the indemnified party under the provisions of this Agreement;
provided, that notice of the intention to so contest shall be delivered by
the indemnifying party to the indemnified party within twenty (20) days from
the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of notice by the indemnified
party of the assertion of the Third Party Claim. Any such contest may be
conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying party or the
indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted by
qualified counsel employed by the indemnifying party and reasonably acceptable
to the indemnified party, and the indemnified party shall also have the right
(but not the obligation) to participate in such proceedings and to be
represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense. The
indemnifying party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) unless the judgment or proposed settlement (i)
involves only the payment of money damages, all of which are paid from the
Escrow Account or by HEP, (ii) expressly and unconditionally releases the
indemnified party and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such Third Party Claim and (iii) does not impose an injunction or
other equitable relief upon the indemnified party, in which case no consent
will be required. If the indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result
obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party.

11.5 _Cooperation_. If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party agrees to cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in
contesting any Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest
or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting
the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the
indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and
its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim.

11.6 _Right to Participate_. The indemnified party agrees to afford the
indemnifying party and its counsel the opportunity to be present at, and to
participate in, conferences with all persons, including any Governmental
Authority, asserting any Third Party Claim against the indemnified party or
conferences with representatives of or counsel for such persons.

 



55 11.7 _Payment of Damages_. The indemnifying party shall pay to the indemnified
party in immediately available funds any amounts to which the indemnified
party may become entitled by reason of the provisions of this Agreement, such
payment to be made within five (5) business days after any such amounts are
finally determined either by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or
pursuant to the final unappealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. Each of Regency, Regency Sub and HEP agrees on its behalf and on
behalf of its respective equity owners, directors, managers, officers,
employees, agents and representatives, to treat any Damages or other payments
pursuant to this Article 11 as an adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price for
all Tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable law. If
the indemnified party is a Regency Party, such Regency Party shall be
entitled to payment under this Section 11.7 from the Escrow Account under the
Escrow Agreement, to the extent Purchase Price Units remain in such Escrow
Account at such time, or from the Diamond Y Escrow Account, to the extent
funds remain in the Diamond Y Escrow Account at such time, as applicable. If a
Regency Party is entitled to payment from the Escrow Account pursuant to the
preceding sentence, then, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
within five (5) business days after any such amounts are finally determined
either by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or pursuant to the final
unappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, such Regency
Party and HEP shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent as
to (i) the number of Purchase Price Units, if any, to be sold by the Escrow
Agent on behalf of HEP to provide cash proceeds to be disbursed by the
Escrow Agent on behalf of HEP to such Regency Party and (ii) instructions as
to the manner in which such cash proceeds shall be disbursed by the Escrow
Agent.

 

11.8 _Release of Escrow Amount and Diamond Y Escrow Account Amounts_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, the Escrow Amount shall be held pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement by the Escrow Agent as security for the payment of any and
all claims (other than claims under 11.2(c)) by a Regency Party against HEP
pursuant to Section 11.2, and all amounts held in the Diamond Y Escrow Account
shall be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement by the Escrow Agent as
security for the payment of any and all claims by a Regency Party against HEP
pursuant to Section 11.2(c).

(b) On the one (1)-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Amount,
then held in the Escrow Account, shall be released from the Escrow Account,
less the amount of any Damages for which reductions have already been made out
of the remaining Escrow Amount pursuant to clause (c) below or for which
there are indemnification claims then pending.

(c) Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall
sell such number of Purchase Price Units that are part of the Escrow Amount
then remaining in the Escrow Account to generate cash proceeds to pay
indemnification obligations for Damages finally determined in accordance
with Section 11.7. Any distributions that have been paid on any Purchase
Price Units and that are held in escrow shall be applied first to pay
indemnification claims for such Damages.

 

(d) On the two (2)-year anniversary of the Closing Date, all amounts then held
in the Diamond Y Escrow Account shall be released from the Diamond Y Escrow
Account, less the amount of any Damages for which reductions have already been
made out of the Diamond Y Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement or for which there are indemnification claims then pending.

 



56 11.9 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement: (A) an indemnifying party shall not be
liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.1(a) or
11.2(a), unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages which may be
recovered from the indemnifying party equals or exceeds, in the aggregate,
one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (the "Basket"), it being agreed and
understood that, if such amount is exceeded, then such indemnifying party
shall be liable to the full extent of the indemnification obligations,
including those not in excess of the Basket; (B) the maximum aggregate amount
of all Damages which may be recovered from an Indemnitor arising out of or
resulting from the causes set forth in Sections 11.1(a) or 11.2(a) shall be
an amount equal to the then existing value of the Escrow Amount, and (C) the
maximum aggregate amount of all Damages which may be recovered from an
Indemnitor arising out of or resulting from the causes set forth in Section
11.2(c) shall be an amount equal to the amount then remaining in the Diamond Y
Escrow Account. The foregoing limitations do not apply to indemnities and
reimbursements under Section 11.2(a) relating to any breach of
any representation or warranty set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4,
3.12, 3.14 and 3.21.

11.10 _Sole Remedy_. After the Closing Date, no party shall have liability
under this Agreement except as is provided in Article 7 or this Article 11, as
applicable. In addition, no party shall be required to indemnify another party
under Article 7 or this Article 11 for any item to the extent such liability
has already been taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 1.3.

11.11  _Reductions_. The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is
provided pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 shall be reduced (but not
below zero) by (a) any related recoveries that the Regency Parties or the
HEP Parties, as applicable, actually realize or receive under insurance
policies or other related payments received or receivable from third parties,
and (b) any Tax benefits actually realized in or prior to the year such
indemnity payment is made through a Tax refund or reduction in Taxes
otherwise payable by the Regency Parties, HEP Parties or any of their
affiliates prior to the indemnity payment and on account of the matter
resulting in such Damages or the payment of such Damages.

 

11.12 _Mitigation_. Regency and Regency Sub acknowledge and agree that HEP
shall not have any liability under any provision of this Agreement with
respect to the portion of any Damages that relates to action by Regency, the
Hoover LLCs or the Subsidiaries after Closing. An indemnified party shall take
and shall cause its affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps
to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring
costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives
rise to the Damages. An indemnified party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue all insurance claims to which it may be entitled in
connection with any Damages it incurs. Any party required to make a payment
under this Article 11 shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to
the rights of the claimant for reimbursement or indemnification against third
parties relating to the claim on which such payment has been based.

 



57 11.13 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO RECEIVE EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES,
SPECIAL DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, MULTIPLES OF CASH FLOW,
REVENUE, OR EBITDA, AND/OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE WAIVER SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11.13 SHALL NOT
APPLY TO ANY EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND/OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES.

in this Agreement will have independent significance. If any party has
breached any representation, warranty or agreement in any respect, the fact
that there exists another representation, warranty or agreement relating to

portion of the Escrow Amount and the Diamond Y Escrow Amount, without
distinction between principal and income, in (i) United States Treasury Bills
(or an investment portfolio or fund investing only in United States Treasury
Bills), (ii) commercial paper rated in the highest grade by a nationally

being held by Escrow Agent as part of the Escrow Amount or the Diamond Y
Escrow Amount, as applicable. Escrow Amount and the Diamond Y Escrow

hereof. Requests (or instructions) received after 11:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) by
Escrow Agent to liquidate the Escrow Amount or the Diamond Y Escrow Amount
will be treated as if received on the Next Business Day. Escrow Agent shall
have no responsibility for any investment losses resulting from the
investment, reinvestment or liquidation of the Escrow Amount or the Diamond
Y Escrow Amount. Any distributions, interest, income or other amounts
received on such investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount or the
Diamond Y Escrow Amount shall become part of the Escrow Amount or the Diamond
Y Escrow Amount, as applicable. It is agreed and understood that Escrow Agent
may earn reasonable fees associated with the investments outlined above.

4.  _Disbursements of Escrow Amount_.

(a) _Purpose_. The Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent
hereunder to secure and provide for the payment of any obligations of HEP to
indemnify any Regency Party for Damages under Article 11 of the Contribution
Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 11.2(c)).

 

(b) _Indemnification Claims_. If any Regency Party asserts a claim for payment
from HEP in respect of any Damages under Section 11.2 of the Contribution
Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 11.2(c)), such Regency Party shall
deliver a copy of the written notice required under Section 11.3 of the
Contribution Agreement to the Escrow Agent. HEP and such Regency Party shall
resolve any disagreement relating to such indemnification claim in accordance
with the terms of the Contribution Agreement. Within five (5) business days
after resolution between HEP and such Regency Party of such indemnification
claim, whether by mutual agreement or by litigation, HEP and Regency shall
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to liquidate, on behalf of HEP and in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 5_ below, such number of Purchase Price Units comprising the Escrow
Units as shall be necessary (taking into account any cash or cash equivalent
amounts then comprising the Escrow Amount) to satisfy the payment of such
indemnification claim. Upon resolution of any disagreement relating to any
such indemnification claim by litigation, if HEP does not timely provide such
joint instruction, Regency may provide Escrow Agent a sole written
instruction, which shall certify and attach a copy of the final, unappealable
judgment of the relevant court, directing the Escrow Agent to liquidate, on
behalf of HEP and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5_ below,
such number of Purchase Price Units comprising the Escrow Units as shall be
necessary (taking into account any cash or cash equivalent amounts then
comprising the Escrow Amount) to satisfy the payment of such indemnification
claim. Upon receipt of such joint or sole notice, Escrow Agent shall promptly
liquidate the necessary number of Purchase Price Units in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 5_ below and pay the full amount of such Damages to
such Regency Party. Regency agrees that it will endeavor to make only one (1)
aggregate claim for payment of any and all indemnification claims under
Article 11 of the Contribution Agreement (other than Section 11.2(c)), and in
any event will make no more than three (3) such claims for payment (each of
which claims for payment will be for any and all resolved indemnification
claims up to the point of such payment).

 



-3- (c) _Scheduled Disbursement of Escrow Amount_. On the one (1) year anniversary
of the date hereof, any remaining Escrow Amount then held by the Escrow
Agent, less all any amounts required to provide for the potential payment of
any then pending claims for indemnification of Damages under Article 11 of the
Contribution Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 11.2(c)), shall be
distributed by the Escrow Agent to HEP. If on such date any claims for
indemnification are pending, Escrow Agent shall make such partial distribution
only pursuant to a joint written instruction from Regency and HEP. Upon
resolution and payment in full of any such then pending claims for
indemnification of Damages, any and all remaining Escrow Amount shall be
promptly distributed by the Escrow Agent to HEP.

 

(d) _Manner of Disbursements_. All disbursements to Regency shall be made by
Escrow Agent in cash in accordance with the wire transfer instructions set
forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto. All disbursements of cash amounts to HEP shall be
made by Escrow Agent in accordance with the wire transfer instructions set
forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto, and all disbursements of Purchase Price Units to
HEP shall be made by Escrow Agent by delivery of a certificate or certificates
evidencing such Purchase Price Units to the address for HEP set forth in
_Section 12_ or, if such Purchase Price Units are held in book entry form,
by book entry in accordance with applicable procedures.

5\. _Manner of Sale of Escrow Units_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the Purchase Price Units comprising the
Escrow Units were issued in a private placement and are "restricted
securities" as such term is defined in Rule 144 (" _Rule 144_ ") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Parties also acknowledge that such
Purchase Price Units are subject to a Lock-Up Agreement pursuant to which HEP
has agreed not to sell any such Purchase Price Units publicly for a period of
180 days after the date hereof or, if earlier, the date on which a resale
registration statement relating to the resale of such Purchase Price Units by
or on behalf of HEP filed by Regency with the Securities and Exchange
Commission becomes effective. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding any
other provisions hereof, no sales of any such Purchase Price Units will be
made by the Escrow Agent on behalf of HEP pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement prior to the date that is the earlier of 180 days after the date
hereof or the effective date of such resale registration statement, and that
any and all such sales shall be made in compliance with Rule 144 or such
effective resale registration statement.

(b) HEP represents and warrants to the other Parties hereto that is it not
currently an "affiliate" of Regency, as such term is used in Rule 144, and
covenants and agrees that until the escrow provided for hereunder terminates,
it shall not become an affiliate of Regency.

 

(c) If Escrow Agent shall be required to liquidate or sell any Purchase Price
Units pursuant to the terms hereof, Regency and HEP shall negotiate in good
faith to agree upon joint written instructions regarding the manner of any
such liquidation or sale. Upon agreement of such joint written instructions,
Regency and HEP shall provide such joint written instructions 

 



-4-  to Escrow Agent, and Escrow Agent shall effect such liquidation or sale only
in accordance with such instructions. If Regency and HEP have been unable to
agree upon such joint written instructions within 30 days, Regency may
provide sole written instructions to Escrow Agent directing Escrow Agent to
liquidate or sell such Purchase Price Units in such manner as Escrow Agent
determines in its sole and absolute discretion will be likely to maximize the
sale proceeds therefrom and will not be reasonably likely to materially
adversely affect the market price of the Common Units, provided that Escrow
Agent shall have no liability to the other Parties hereto with respect to
its exercise of such discretion. In no event shall Escrow Agent liquidate or
sell in any trading day an amount of Common Units in excess of 25% of the
average daily trading volume of the Common Units over the prior 90 calendar
day period unless otherwise instructed to do so by joint written instruction
from Regency and HEP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Regency and HEP agree
that HEP, at its sole discretion, may pay in cash any indemnification claims
pursuant to Section 11 of the Contribution Agreement in lieu of such
liquidation or sale of the Purchase Price Units pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) HEP hereby irrevocably appoints Escrow Agent as HEPs attorney-in-fact,
with full authority in the place and stead of HEP and in the name of HEP or
otherwise, from time to time in Escrow Agents discretion upon the occurrence
any event requiring the liquidation or sale of any Purchase Price Units held
by Escrow Agent hereunder, to take any action and to execute any assignment,
certificate, stock power, notification, document or instrument which Escrow
Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish such liquidation or sale
or any other purpose of this Agreement, including, without limitation, to
receive, endorse and collect all instruments made payable to HEP representing
any distribution, dividend, interest payment or other distribution in respect
of the Escrow Amount or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the
same.

6\. _Disbursements of Diamond Y Escrow Amount_.

(a) _Purpose_. The Diamond Y Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow by the
Escrow Agent hereunder to secure and provide for the payment of any
obligations of HEP to indemnify any Regency Party for Damages under Section
11.2(c) of the Contribution Agreement.

 

(b) _Indemnification Claims_. If any Regency Party asserts a claim for payment
from HEP in respect of any Damages under Section 11.2(c) of the Contribution
Agreement, such Regency Party shall deliver a copy of the written notice
required under Section 11.3 of the Contribution Agreement to the Escrow Agent.
HEP and such Regency Party shall resolve any disagreement relating to such
indemnification claim in accordance with the terms of the Contribution
Agreement. Within five (5) business days after resolution between HEP and such
Regency Party of such indemnification claim, whether by mutual agreement or
by litigation, HEP and Regency shall deliver a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to distribute to such Regency
Party the amount of such Damages from the Diamond Y Escrow Amount to satisfy
the payment of such indemnification claim. Upon resolution of any
disagreement relating to any such indemnification claim by litigation, if HEP
does not timely provide such joint instruction, Regency may provide Escrow
Agent a sole written instruction, which shall certify and attach a copy of
the final, unappealable judgment of the relevant court, directing the Escrow
Agent to distribute to such Regency Party the amount of such Damages from the
Diamond Y Escrow Amount to satisfy the payment of such

 



-5-  indemnification claim. Upon receipt of such joint or sole notice, Escrow
Agent shall promptly distribute to the indicated Regency party the specified
amount (but not in excess of any funds then remaining as the Diamond Y Escrow
Amount).

(c) _Scheduled Disbursement of Escrow Amount_. On the two (2) year anniversary
of the date hereof, any remaining Diamond Y Escrow Amount then held by the
Escrow Agent, less all any amounts required to provide for the potential
payment of any then pending claims for indemnification of Damages under
Section 11.2(c) of the Contribution Agreement, shall be distributed by the
Escrow Agent to HEP. If on such date any claims for indemnification are
pending, Escrow Agent shall make such partial distribution only pursuant to a
joint written instruction from Regency and HEP. Upon resolution and payment
in full of any such then pending claims for indemnification of Damages, any
and all remaining Diamond Y Escrow Amount shall be promptly distributed by the
Escrow Agent to HEP.

 

(d) _Manner of Disbursements_. All disbursements to Regency shall be made by
Escrow Agent in cash in accordance with the wire transfer instructions set
forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto. All disbursements of cash amounts to HEP shall
be made by Escrow Agent in accordance with the wire transfer instructions set
forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto.

 

7\. _Termination of Escrow_. The escrow provided for hereunder shall terminate
upon the earlier to occur of the following:

 

(a) upon the mutual written consent of Regency and HEP (written notice of
which shall be given to Escrow Agent); or

 

(b) upon the later of (i) the disbursement of all of the Escrow Amount
pursuant to _Section 4_ of this Agreement and (ii) the disbursement of all
of the Diamond Y Escrow Amount pursuant to _Section 4_ of this Agreement.

8\. _Escrow Agent_. In performing its duties under this Agreement or upon the
claimed failure to perform its duties hereunder, Escrow Agent shall have no
liability, except for its acts of recklessness, fraud, willful misconduct or
gross negligence. Escrow Agents sole responsibility shall be for the
safekeeping and disbursement of the Escrow Amount and the Diamond Y Escrow
Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall have
no implied duties or obligations and shall not be charged with knowledge or
notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set forth herein or in any
notice given to it under this Agreement in accordance with _Section 12_ of
this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon and shall be
protected in acting upon any request, instructions, statement or other
instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but
also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein,
which Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been
signed or presented by the person or Parties purporting to sign the same and
to conform to the provisions of this Agreement. In no event shall Escrow Agent
be liable for incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive
damages. Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or to
commence any proceeding in connection with the Escrow Amount or any account in
which the Escrow Amount and the Diamond Y Escrow Amount is deposited or this
Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal action or
proceedings. Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in the
event of any dispute 

 



-6-  or question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any
other agreement or of its duties hereunder, and shall incur no liability and
shall be fully protected from any liability whatsoever in acting in
accordance with the opinion or instruction of such counsel. Regency and HEP,
jointly and severally, shall promptly pay upon demand the reasonable fees and
expenses of any such counsel; _provided_ ,  _however_ , Regency and HEP agree
that such fees and expenses shall be borne equally between Regency and HEP.
Escrow Agent shall have no obligations or responsibilities in connection with
the Contribution Agreement, or any other agreement between the Parties, other
than this Agreement.

9\. _Indemnification_. From and at all times after the date of this
Agreement, Regency and HEP, jointly and severally, shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law and to the extent provided herein, indemnify and hold
harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent
and affiliate of Escrow Agent (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages,
liabilities, costs, penalties, fines, judgments and expenses of any kind or
nature whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses)
incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from and after
the date hereof, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or
arising from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or
proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by any Person, whether
threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy
against any person under any statute or regulation, including any federal or
state securities laws, or under any common law or equitable cause or
otherwise, arising from or in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, performance or failure of performance of this Agreement or any
transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any such Indemnified Party
is a party to any such action, proceeding, suit or the target of any such
inquiry or investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified Party
shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, subject to no further appeal,
to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Party. If any such action or claim shall be brought or asserted
against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify
Regency and HEP in writing, and such Indemnified Party shall assume the
defense thereof, including the employment of counsel; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Regency and HEP, and
Regency and HEP shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of such counsel
referred to in the foregoing sentence. All such fees and expenses payable
by Regency and HEP pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be paid from time
to time as incurred, both in advance of and after the final disposition of
such action or claim. All of the foregoing losses, damages, costs and expenses
of the Indemnified Parties shall be payable by Regency and HEP, jointly and
severally, upon demand by such Indemnified Party. As between Regency and HEP,
such losses, damages, costs and expenses shall be borne equally between
Regency and HEP. The obligations of Regency and HEP under this _Section 8_
shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal
of Escrow Agent.

 

The Parties agree that neither the payment by Regency or HEP of any claim by
Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder nor the disbursement of any
amounts to Escrow Agent from the Escrow Amount or the Diamond Y Escrow Amount
in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification shall impair, limit,
modify or affect, as between Regency and HEP, the respective rights and
obligations of Regency and HEP under this Agreement. Regency and HEP agree
among themselves that any obligation for indemnification under this Section 8
shall be

 



-7-  borne by Regency and HEP in proportion to Regencys and HEPs respective
responsibility, if any, of such loss, damage, liability, cost or expense for
which Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification, the causation to be
determined by mutual agreement, arbitration (if Regency and HEP agree in
writing to submit the dispute to arbitration) or litigation; provided,
however, that if no such Party is determined to be responsible for such loss,
damage, liability, cost or expense, any obligation for indemnification under
this Section 8 shall be borne equally between Regency and HEP.

 

10\. _Disputes_. If, at any time, there shall exist any dispute between
Regency and HEP with respect to the holding or disposition of any portion of
the Escrow Amount or the Diamond Y Escrow Amount or any other obligations of
Escrow Agent hereunder, or if at any time Escrow Agent is unable to determine,
to Escrow Agents sole satisfaction, the proper disposition of any portion
of the Escrow Amount or Escrow Agents proper actions with respect to its
obligations hereunder, or if Regency and HEP have not, within thirty (30)
calendar days of the furnishing by Escrow Agent of a notice of resignation
pursuant to  _Section 10_ below, appointed a successor escrow agent to act
hereunder, then Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, take either or both
of the following actions:

 

(a) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement
until such dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction
of Escrow Agent or until a successor escrow agent shall have been appointed
(as the case may be) as evidenced by written instructions executed by Regency
and HEP;

 

(b) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction in Texas, for instructions with
respect to such dispute or uncertainty, and pay into or deposit with such
court all disputed escrow amounts held by it as the Escrow Amount or the
Diamond Y Escrow Amount for holding and disposition in accordance with
the instructions of such court.

Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Regency, Regency Sub, HEP or any other
person with respect to any such suspension of performance or disbursement
into court, specifically including any liability that may arise, or be alleged
to have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the disbursement of
funds held as the Escrow Amount or the Diamond Y Escrow Amount or any delay
in or with respect to any other action required or requested of Escrow Agent.

11\. _Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent may resign from
the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving ten (10)
Business Days prior written notice to Regency and HEP or may be removed, with
or without cause, by Regency and HEP, acting jointly, at any time by the
giving of ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to Escrow Agent. Such
resignation or removal shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor
escrow agent as provided herein. Upon any such notice of resignation or
removal, Regency and HEP, acting jointly, shall appoint a successor escrow
agent hereunder, which shall be a commercial bank, trust seller or other
financial institution with a combined capital and surplus in excess
of $100,000,000, unless otherwise agreed by Regency and HEP as evidenced by
written instructions executed by Regency and HEP. Upon the acceptance in
writing of any appointment as Escrow Agent hereunder by a successor escrow
agent, such successor escrow agent shall thereupon

 



-8-  succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Escrow Agent, and the retiring Escrow Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement, but shall
not be discharged from any liability for actions taken as Escrow Agent
hereunder prior to such succession. After any retiring Escrow Agents
resignation or removal, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

12\. _Fees_. Regency and HEP shall compensate Escrow Agent for its services
hereunder in accordance with _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and, in addition,
shall reimburse Escrow Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including attorneys fees, travel expenses, telephone and facsimile
transmission costs, postage, copying charges and the like (collectively, the "
_Fees_ "). All of the compensation and reimbursement obligations set forth in
this _Section 11_ shall be payable upon demand by Escrow Agent and, with
respect to Escrow Agent, shall be a joint and several obligation of Regency
and HEP. Regency and HEP agree that the Fees shall be borne equally between
Regency and HEP, and the Fees payable by HEP may be deducted from the Escrow
Amount otherwise required to be distributed to HEP. The obligations of Regency
and HEP under this _Section 11_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

 

13\. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other
document to be given hereunder by any party to the other parties (herein
collectively called "Notice") shall be in writing and delivered in person or
by courier service requiring acknowledgment of receipt of delivery or mailed
by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or

OF TEXAS AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN
HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS, AND APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM, OVER ANY
ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, AND AGREES NOT TO

JURISDICTION OR THAT SUCH ACTION MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN
THOSE COURTS OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY THOSE COURTS
OR THAT ITS PROPERTY IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM EXECUTION, THAT SUCH ACTION IS

23\. _Integration_. This Agreement and the documents executed pursuant to this
Agreement and the Contribution Agreement supersede all negotiations,

obligated to pay in the way of such taxes. Regency and HEP agree that such
expenses shall be borne equally between Regency, on the one hand, and HEP, on

Escrow Amount by Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms hereof. Any payments of
income from this Escrow Amount shall be subject to withholding regulations
then in force with respect to United States taxes, recognizing that no
withholding may apply on distributions to HEP of the Escrow Units as a result
of HEPs treatment as owner of the Escrow Units for tax purposes and its
reporting of income from such Units as its income for federal and state tax
purposes. HEP will provide Escrow Agent with appropriate W-9 forms for tax
I.D. in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ , number certifications, or

NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

 

(HEP)

This NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of [], by and among Regency Energy Partners LP, a Delaware limited
partnership (" _Regency_ "), Regency HEP LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Regency Sub_ ") and Hoover Energy Partners LP ("HEP").

 

 _RECITALS:_

A. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, Regency, Regency
Sub and _HEP_ are closing the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement dated December 22, 2013 (the " _Contribution Agreement_ ") pursuant
to which, subject to the terms thereof, HEP will contribute to Regency Sub all
of the membership interests in Hoover Energy Texas LLC, Hoover Energy Texas
Crude LLC, Hoover Pecos River Limited Partner LLC and Hoover Pecos River
General Partner LLC, all Texas limited liability companies (collectively, the
" _Hoover LLCs_ "), and Regency Sub will accept all of the membership
interests of the Hoover LLCs.

 

B. HEP will receive significant benefits upon the closing of the Contribution
Agreement, including the consideration to be received by HEP pursuant to the
Contribution Agreement.

C. The Contribution Agreement requires HEP to enter into this Agreement with
Regency and Regency Sub as a condition precedent to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby; this Agreement is a material inducement to
Regency and Regency Sub to enter into the Contribution Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; and Regency and Regency Sub
would be unwilling to enter into the Contribution Agreement and consummate
such transactions if HEP did not enter into this Agreement.

 

Accordingly, in consideration of the foregoing, the premises, the mutual
covenants and restrictions contained herein and in the Contribution Agreement
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, Regency, Regency Sub and HEP hereby agree as
follows:

 

1\. _Capitalized Terms_. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein, including in the
recitals hereto, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Contribution Agreement.

2\. _Consideration_. In consideration of HEP entering into and abiding by the
terms of this Agreement, Regency and Regency Sub agree, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein, to consummate the transactions contemplated
in the Contribution Agreement.

 

3\. _Covenant Not To Compete_. HEP covenants and agrees with Regency and
Regency Sub that, effective as of the Closing Date and for a period of two
(2) years thereafter,  without the consent of Regency, HEP will not, and will not permit any of
HEPs Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, engage in oil and natural gas
gathering and transportation in Loving, Pecos, Reeves and Ward Counties in
the State of Texas (such activities are referred to collectively as the "
_Business_ "), or assist any Person to do the same. HEP acknowledges and
agrees that the words "directly or indirectly" include HEP or any of HEPs
Affiliates competing individually or in partnership or jointly or in
conjunction with any Person or as principal, agent, lender, creditor, advisor,
consultant, owner, partner, independent contractor, shareholder or in any
manner whatsoever. As used herein, the term "Affiliate" of a Person means
trust, corporation, general partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability company or other entity controlled by, directly or indirectly, such
person. Control shall include being a manager, general partner, or similar
position of authority with respect to such entity, or ownership of 5% or more
of the voting equity interests in such entity.

 

4\. _Covenant Not to Solicit Employees_. In addition, consistent with the
foregoing, HEP further agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date and for
a period of one (1) year thereafter, HEP will not solicit or recruit for
employment any Person who was as of the date of the execution and delivery of
the Contribution Agreement or as of the Closing Date an employee of HEP or
Staff One HR, LLC or their respective Affiliates, to the extent such employee
was employed in the Business, or otherwise solicit or induce any such Person
to terminate his or her employment with the Hoover LLCs, Regency or its
Affiliates (provided that this sentence shall not prohibit placing
advertisements in publications of general circulation that solicit employment
and that are not specifically targeted to such persons and recruiting the
persons who respond thereto).

 

5\. _Reasonableness and Opportunity to Consult With Counsel_. HEP acknowledges
that this covenant not to compete is being provided as an inducement to
Regency and Regency Sub to acquire all of the membership interests in the
Hoover LLCs and that this Agreement contains reasonable limitations as to
time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained that do not
impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other
business interest of Regency, Regency Sub and their Affiliates. The terms and
scope of the covenants contained in Sections 3 and 4 are considered by the
parties hereto to be (i) fair, reasonable and necessary for the protection of
the legitimate business interests of Regency, Regency Sub and their Affiliates
and the conduct of the Business, (ii) not injurious to the public and (iii)
appropriate based on the nature of the Business. Regency and HEP have been
represented by counsel throughout the negotiation of this Agreement (or have
had the opportunity to be represented by counsel) and have had the opportunity
to consult with counsel about every provision of this Agreement.

6\. _Equitable Relief_. The parties mutually acknowledge and agree that if a
violation of any covenant contained in Section 3 or 4 occurs, such violation
may cause irreparable injury to Regency or its Affiliates and the remedy at
law for any such violation will be inadequate. HEP agrees that, upon any
breach or anticipated breach by HEP (or its Affiliates) of any of such
sections, Regency and its Affiliates will be entitled to appropriate equitable
relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order or a
preliminary injunction. Such equitable relief will be in addition to any
damages to which Regency and its Affiliates may be entitled. The provisions of
Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement will survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of each such Section. Nothing in this
provision or this Agreement will limit any rights or remedies otherwise
available to Regency and its Affiliates under federal, state or local law.

 



2 7\. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remaining provisions
of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement shall, for any reason,
be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remainder of this Agreement but shall be confined in its operation to the
provision of this Agreement directly involved in the controversy in which such
judgment shall have been rendered and shall apply only to the
individual Shareholder directly involved in the controversy in which such
judgment shall have been rendered. If the provisions of this Agreement should
ever be deemed to exceed the time or geographic limitations permitted by
applicable laws, then such provision shall be reformed to the maximum time or
geographic limitations permitted by applicable law.

8\. _Entire Agreement, Termination_. This Agreement (including the recitals
hereto) together with the Contribution Agreement and the ancillary agreements
contemplated thereby, sets forth the entire Agreement and understanding of the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and supersedes all prior
agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to the specific subject
matter of this Agreement. This Agreement will terminate and be of no further
force and effect upon any termination of the Contribution Agreement before the
Closing thereunder.

9\. _Governing Law; Venue_.

(a) This Agreement and all matters arising from or relating to this Agreement
shall be governed and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of
the State of Texas without reference to principles of conflicts of law.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY CONSENTS TO, AND CONFERS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION
UPON THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS, AND APPROPRIATE APPELLATE
COURTS THEREFROM, OVER ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY SUCH ACTION THAT IT IS
NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH JURISDICTION OR THAT SUCH ACTION MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS
NOT MAINTAINABLE IN THOSE COURTS OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN
OR BY THOSE COURTS OR THAT ITS PROPERTY IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM EXECUTION,
THAT SUCH ACTION IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, OR THAT THE VENUE OF
SUCH ACTION IS IMPROPER. SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH ACTION MAY BE SERVED
ON ANY PARTY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, WHETHER WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE STATE OF
TEXAS, AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

 



3 10\. _Amendments and Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
provided herein will be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.

11\. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other
document to be given hereunder by either party to the other (herein

Affiliates. Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence will be void
_ab initio_.

at any time in the future of) any Purchase Price Units or securities
convertible into, or exchangeable for Purchase Price Units, or sell or grant
options, rights or warrants with respect to any Purchase Price Units or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Purchase Price Units, or (ii)
enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of
ownership of such Purchase Price Units, whether any such transaction described

Units or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or (iii) publicly disclose
the intention to do any of the foregoing, in each case for a period of 180

provided, however, that:

 



     | (i) | HEP may distribute the Purchase Price Units to its limited

and certain of its and their employees; provided that it shall be a condition
to any such distribution that all such limited and general partners of HEP

ARTICLE II

 

 _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

 

Section 2.01 _Shelf Registration_.

 

(a) _Shelf Registration_. Subject to Section 2.01(b) of this Agreement, after
Regency files is Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2013 with the Commission, Regency shall prepare and file a registration
statement under the Securities Act to permit the public resale of the
Registrable Securities from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 (or any
similar provision then in force) of the Securities Act (the " _Shelf
Registration Statement_ "). Regency shall use its reasonable best efforts to
file the Shelf Registration Statement within ten (10) business days after
the date on which it files its Annual Report with the Commission and to cause
it to be effective as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (the " _Shelf
Registration_ "). The Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this Section 2.01(a) shall be on such appropriate registration form of the
Commission as shall be selected by Regency; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a
prospectus supplement will be used in connection with the marketing of an
Underwritten Offering from the Shelf Registration Statement and the Managing
Underwriter at any time shall notify HEP in writing that, in the sole judgment
of such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed information to be used in
such prospectus supplement is of material importance to the success of the
Underwritten Offering of such Registrable Securities, Regency shall use its
reasonable best efforts to include such information in such a prospectus
supplement. Regency will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) to be
continuously effective under the Securities Act until all Registrable
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been distributed
in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Shelf Registration
Statement or there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding (the "
_Effectiveness Period_ "). The Shelf Registration Statement when declared
effective (including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will
comply as to form with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading.

(b) _Postponement and Delay Rights_. If Regency determines in good faith that
the registration contemplated by Section 2.01(a) would be materially
detrimental to Regency because such registration would (x) materially
interfere with a significant acquisition, 

 



-3-  reorganization or other similar transaction involving Regency, (y) require
premature disclosure of material information that Regency has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render Regency unable
to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then Regency
shall have the right to postpone such requested registration until such reason
to postpone such registration no longer exists. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Regency may, upon written notice to
any Selling Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf
Registration Statement, suspend such Selling Holders use of any prospectus
which is a part of the Shelf Registration Statement (in which event the
Selling Holder shall discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Shelf Registration Statement) if Regency (i) is pursuing a
financing, acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar
transaction and determines in good faith that its ability to pursue or
consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely affected by any
required disclosure of such transaction in the Shelf Registration Statement
or (ii) has experienced some other material non-public event the disclosure of
which at such time, in the good faith judgment of Regency would materially
adversely affect Regency. Upon public disclosure of such information or the
termination of the condition described above, Regency shall provide prompt
notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in the
Shelf Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of
sales it has put into effect and shall take such other actions to permit
registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Underwritten Offering_.

 

In the event that the Selling Holders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities covered by this Agreement elect to dispose of all or a portion of
such Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to
an Underwritten Offering, Regency shall enter into an underwriting agreement
in customary form with the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters, which
shall include, among other provisions, indemnities to the effect and to the
extent provided in Section 2.08, and shall take all such other reasonable
actions as are requested by the Managing Underwriter in order to expedite or
facilitate the registration and disposition of the Registrable Securities. In
connection with any Underwritten Offering under this Agreement, Regency shall
be entitled to select the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters, subject to the
consent of HEP not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Selling Holder
may participate in such Underwritten Offering unless such Selling Holder
agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such
underwriting agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers
of attorney, indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the
terms of such underwriting agreement. Each Selling Holder may, at its option,
require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the
other agreements on the part of, Regency to and for the benefit of such
underwriters also be made to and for such Selling Holders benefit and that
any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters
under such underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent to its
obligations. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations
or warranties to or agreements with Regency other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holder and its ownership of
the securities being registered on its behalf and its intended method of
distribution and any other representations required by law. If any Selling
Holder disapproves of the terms of an underwriting, such Selling Holder may
elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to

 



-4-  Regency and the Managing Underwriter; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
notice of withdrawal must be made before or at the time of pricing of such
offering in order to be effective. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall
affect Regencys obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

Section 2.03 _Piggyback Registration._

(a) _Right to Piggyback_. At any time during the period beginning on the date
hereof and ending on the date two (2) years thereafter, whenever common units
of Regency are to be offered and sold by Regency for its own account in an
underwritten registered offering under the Securities Act (other than pursuant
to a registration statement on Form S-4 (or any successor form thereto) or
Form S-8 (or any successor form thereto) or pursuant to an "at-the-market"
offering) and the registration form to be used may be used for the
registration of Registrable Securities (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "),
Regency will give prompt written notice (including but not limited to notice
by electronic mail) to all Holders of Registrable Securities of its intention
to effect such a registration and will include in such registration, subject
to the provisions of Sections 2.03(b) and 2.03(c), all Registrable Securities
with respect to which Regency has received written requests for inclusion
therein within the earlier of (i) five (5) days after Regencys notice has
been given and (ii) one day before such registration statement is to be filed
by Regency with the Commission. If no request for inclusion from a Holder is
received within the specified time, such Holder shall have no further right
to participate in such underwritten offering. Each Holder agrees to receive
such notice and acknowledges that, if such proposed offering has not been
publicly announced, such notice will constitute material non-public
information regarding Regency, and agrees to maintain the confidentiality of
such information until such time as Regency makes such information publicly
available. Each Holders rights under this Section 2.03(a) shall terminate
when such Holder (together with any Affiliates of such Holder) holds,
directly or indirectly, less than $5 million in the aggregate of Registrable
Securities, based on the Common Unit Price.

 

(b) _Priority on Piggyback Registrations_. If the managing underwriter advises
Regency that in its opinion the aggregate number of Registrable Securities
and any other common units having piggyback registration rights requested to
be included in such registration pursuant to Section 2.03(a) or the
registration rights agreement applicable to such other common units (the
"Requested Piggyback Securities") would have a material adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the common units in such offering, Regency
will include in such registration (i) first, any securities Regency proposes
to sell, and (ii) second, the Requested Piggyback Securities, which in the
opinion of such Managing Underwriter can be sold in such registration without
having a material adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of
the common units in such offering, with the total of any reductions in the
number of Requested Piggyback Securities to be included to be allocated on a
pro rata basis among the demanding Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities
and any other selling security holders.

(c) _Control by Regency_. Regency may postpone or abandon the filing or the
effectiveness of any registration statement initiated by Regency without the
consent of any Holder of Registrable Securities, notwithstanding the request
of any such Holder to participate therein in accordance with Section 2.03(a).

 



-5- Section 2.04 _Registration Procedures_.

 

In connection with its obligations contained in Sections 2.01 and 2.03,
Regency will, as expeditiously as possible:

 

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to a
registration statement on the appropriate form and the prospectus used with
respect to such Registrable Securities as may be necessary to keep (i) the
Shelf Registration Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period and (ii)
the registration statement in connection with a Piggyback Registration
effective for the period of distribution contemplated thereby, and as may be
necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to
the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement;

 

(b) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing the registration statement or any supplement or
amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all
such documents proposed to be filed (including furnishing or making available
exhibits and each document incorporated by reference therein to the extent
then required by the rules and regulations of the Commission), and provide
each such Selling Holder the opportunity to object to any information
pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution that is
contained therein and make the corrections reasonably requested by such
Selling Holder with respect to such information prior to filing the
registration statement or supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such
number of copies of the registration statement and the prospectus included
therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as such Persons may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition
of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement;

 

(c) if applicable, use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter, shall
reasonably request, provided that neither Regency nor its general partner
will be required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction
where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action which would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then so subject;

(d) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time when
a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the registration statement or any
prospectus or prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, and, with respect to such registration
statement, when the same has become effective; and (ii) any written comments
from the Commission with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and
any written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the
registration statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;

 



-6- (e) immediately notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in the registration statement,
as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances then
existing; (ii) the issuance or threat of issuance by the Commission of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement, or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by
Regency of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable
securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of
such notice, subject to Section 2.01(b) of this Agreement, Regency agrees
to as promptly as practicable amend or supplement the prospectus or
prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that the prospectus
or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in light of the
circumstances then existing, and to take such other action as is necessary to
remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related
thereto;

(f) furnish to each Selling Holder, upon request, copies of any and all
transmittal letters or other correspondence with the Commission or any other
governmental agency or self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction
(including any domestic or foreign securities exchange) relating to such
offering of Registrable Securities;

 

(g) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish upon request and
addressed to the underwriters and to the Selling Holders, (i) an opinion of
counsel for Regency, dated the effective date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement, and (ii) a "comfort letter," dated the effective date
of the applicable registration statement or the date of any amendment or
supplement thereto and a letter of like kind dated the date of the closing
under the underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by the independent
public accountants who have certified Regencys financial statements included
or incorporated by reference into the applicable registration statement, and
each of the opinion and the "comfort letter" shall be in customary form and
cover substantially the same matters with respect to such registration
statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement included therein)
as are customarily covered in opinions of issuers counsel and in accountants
letters delivered to the underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of securities,
and such other matters as such underwriters may reasonably request;

(h) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months,
beginning with the first full calendar month after the effective date of such
registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;

 



-7- (i) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter and Selling Holders access to such information and Regency

representative has entered into a confidentiality agreement with Regency;

 

(j) at least five (5) days prior to the filing of any registration statement
or prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such registration statement
or prospectus, furnish a copy thereof to one counsel selected by the Selling
Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities being registered;

 

(k) refrain from filing any such registration statement, prospectus, amendment
or supplement to which counsel selected by the Selling Holders of at least a
majority of the Registrable Securities being registered shall have reasonably
objected on the grounds that such amendment or supplement does not comply in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
rules and regulations thereunder, unless, in the case of an amendment or
supplement, in the opinion of counsel for Regency the filing of such amendment
or supplement is reasonably necessary to protect Regency from any liabilities
under any applicable federal or state law and such filing will not violate
applicable laws;

(l) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which similar securities issued by Regency are then
listed;

 

(m) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
Regency to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities;

 

(n) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement not later than the effective date of
such registration statement; and

(o) otherwise used its reasonable best efforts to take all other steps
necessary to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities
contemplated hereby.

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from Regency of the happening of
any event of the kind described in subsection (e) of this Section 2.04, shall
forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable Securities until such
Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by subsection (e) of this Section 2.04 or until it is
advised in writing by Regency that the use of the prospectus may be resumed,
and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by Regency,
such Selling Holder will, or will request the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, to deliver to Regency (at Regencys expense) all copies
in their possession or control, other than permanent file copies then in such
Selling Holders possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

 



-8- Section 2.05 _Cooperation by Holders_.

 

Regency shall have no obligation to include in the registration statement
Registrable Securities of a Holder who has failed to timely furnish such
information which, in the opinion of counsel to Regency, is reasonably
required in order for the registration statement or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement thereto, as applicable, to comply with the Securities
Act.

 

Section 2.06 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_.

 

Each Holder of Registrable Securities who is included in a registration
statement agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of
the Registrable Securities during the lock-up period contained in a
prospectus supplement filed with the Commission with respect to the pricing of
an Underwritten Offering, provided that (i) Regency gives written notice to
such Holder of the date of the commencement and termination of such period
with respect to any such Underwritten Offering and (ii) the duration of the
foregoing restrictions shall be no longer than the duration of the shortest
restriction generally imposed by the underwriters on Regency or on the
officers or directors or any other unitholder of Regency on whom a restriction
is imposed.

 

Section 2.07 _Expenses._

 

(a) _Certain Definitions_. " _Registration Expenses_ " means all expenses
incident to Regencys performance under or compliance with this Agreement to
effect the registration of Registrable Securities in a registration, and the
disposition of such securities, including, without limitation, all
registration, filing, securities exchange listing fees, all registration,
filing, qualification and other fees and expenses of complying with securities
or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
transfer taxes and fees of transfer agents and registrars, all
word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, the fees and
disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for Regency,
including the expenses of any special audits or "comfort letters" required by
or incident to such performance and compliance. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 2.08 hereof, Regency shall not be responsible for legal fees
incurred by Holders in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights
hereunder. In addition, Regency shall not be responsible for any " _Selling
Expenses_ ," which means all underwriting fees, discounts and selling
commissions allocable to the sale of the Registrable Securities.

 

(b) _Expenses_. Regency will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with
any registration statement filed pursuant to this Agreement, whether or not
the registration statement becomes effective or any sale is made pursuant to
the registration statement. Each Selling Holder shall pay all Selling Expenses
in connection with any sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder.

 



-9- Section 2.08 _Indemnification._

 

(a) _By Regency_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, Regency will indemnify
and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder, its directors and officers
and each underwriter pursuant to the applicable underwriting agreement with
such underwriter and each Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder or
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), joint
or several, to which such Selling Holder or underwriter or controlling Person
may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise,
insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or
threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
registration statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or
are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading, and will reimburse each such Selling Holder, its
directors and officers, each such underwriter and each such controlling Person
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection
with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions or proceedings;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Regency will not be liable in any such case if
and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made
in conformity with information furnished by such Selling Holder, such
underwriter or such controlling Person in writing specifically for use in the
registration statement or any prospectus contained therein or any amendment or
supplement thereof. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder or
any such director, officer or controlling Person, and shall survive the
transfer of such securities by such Selling Holder.

(b)  _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless Regency, its directors and officers,
and each Person, if any, who controls Regency within the meaning of the
Securities Act or of the Exchange Act against any Losses to the same extent
as the foregoing indemnity from Regency to the Selling Holders, but only with
respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by
or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in the
registration statement or any prospectus contained therein or any amendment or
supplement thereof relating to the Registrable Securities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the liability of each Selling Holder shall not be greater in
amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses)
received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities
giving rise to such indemnification.

 

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but such
indemnified partys failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified party other than under this Section 2.08. The indemnifying

 



-10-  party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish,
to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and
undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
such indemnified party under this Section 2.08 for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of
liaison with counsel so selected; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) if the
indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or
(ii) if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have
concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified
party that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably
may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, then
the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to
assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such
action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of one such separate counsel
(firm) and other reasonable expenses related to such participation to be
reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no indemnified party shall settle any action
brought against it with respect to which it is entitled to indemnification
hereunder without the consent of the indemnifying party, unless the settlement
thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete and
unconditional release from all liability of, the indemnifying party.

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.08
is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to Regency or any Selling Holder or is insufficient to hold it
harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu
of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid
or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses as between
Regency, on the one hand, and such Selling Holder, on the other hand, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Regency, on the
one hand, and of such Selling Holder, on the other, in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in
excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by
such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of Regency, on the one hand, and each
Selling Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been
made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to
be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in
the first sentence of this paragraph. The amount paid by an indemnified party
as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any legal and

 



-11-  other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with investigating or defending any Loss which is the subject of this
paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this Section 2.08 shall be in
addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

Section 2.09  _Rule 144 Reporting_.

With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations
of the Commission that may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to
the public without registration, Regency agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to:

 

(a) make and keep public information regarding Regency available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, for a
period of at least twelve (12) months from and after the date hereof; and

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of Regency under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
for a period of at least twelve (12) months from and after the date hereof.

 

Section 2.10 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_.

 

The rights to cause Regency to include Registrable Securities in a
registration statement pursuant to this Agreement may be transferred
or assigned by HEP to one or more transferee(s) or assignee(s) of such
Registrable Securities, provided that (a) such transferee or assignee is (i)
an Affiliate of HEP, (ii) receives at least 20% of the Common Units covered by
this Agreement, or (iii) receives Common Units covered by this Agreement
prior to six months after the date of this Agreement, but such rights shall be
effective until only six months after the date of this Agreement, (b) Regency
is given written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the
name and address of each such transferee and identifying the securities with
respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned,
and (c) each such transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility
for its portion of the obligations of HEP under this Agreement and agrees to
be bound by the terms hereof.

 

Section 2.11 _Information by Holder_.

 

Any Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities included in any registration
statement shall promptly furnish to Regency such information regarding such
Holder or Holders and the distribution proposed by such Holder or Holders as
Regency may reasonably request and as shall be required in connection with any
registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein.

EXHIBIT F

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Transition Services Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of 
, 20 , by and between Regency Energy Partners LP, a Delaware limited
partnership (" _Regency_ "), on behalf of Regency HEP LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Regency Sub_ "), and Hoover Energy Partners LP, a
Delaware limited partnership (" _HEP_ ") (Regency and HEP, each a " _Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Parties_ "). Capitalized terms used but not defined
herein have the meanings given to them in the Contribution Agreement (defined
below).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Contribution Agreement, dated as of December
22, 2013 (the " _Contribution Agreement_ "), by and among Regency, Regency
Sub and HEP, HEP has agreed to contribute to Regency Sub all of HEPs equity
interests in the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries (as such terms are defined
in the Contribution Agreement) (the "Acquired Companies") pursuant to the
terms and conditions specified therein; and

WHEREAS, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Contribution Agreement, Regency desires that HEP provide, or cause to
be provided, to Regency Sub certain interim and transitional services to
facilitate the operation of the business of the Hoover LLCs and the
Subsidiaries following the date hereof in accordance with the terms set forth
herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

 

1\. _Transition Services_.

 

1.1 During the term of this Agreement as set forth in Section 3 hereof, HEP
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Regency Sub, the services listed
on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the " _Service Schedule_ "), which services
collectively shall be referred to as the " _Transition Services_."

 

1.2 Regency shall pay HEP a monthly fee of $175,000 (the " _Monthly Transition
Services Fee_ ") for providing the Transition Services, which is a reasonable
approximation of the costs, including any allocated overhead expenses that are
directly related to the provision of the Transition Services to Regency Sub,
incurred by HEP to provide the Transition Services.

 

1.3 HEP shall not be obligated to provide any service to Regency Sub other
than the Transition Services. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, in no case shall HEP be required to render or provide any
professional advice or opinion, including, but not limited to with regard to
tax, legal, treasury, finance or employment issues. 1.4 HEP shall provide, or cause to be provided, the Transition Services in all
material respects (including accuracy, quality, completeness, timeliness,
priority and responsiveness) consistent with the quality, timing, level and
volume of services provided to the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries within the
twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date (the " _Performance Standard_
"). EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES, HEP HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
OTHER WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSITION SERVICES OR THIS AGREEMENT,
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE MANNER, MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. If Regency believes that any Transition
Service has failed to meet the Performance Standard, Regency shall notify HEP
of such failure and, if requested by HEP, shall meet with HEP (in person, by
videoconference, or by teleconference) as promptly as practicable (but in any
event during the following fifteen (15) days) to discuss possible actions
to cure such failure. If a particular Transition Service does not meet the
Performance Standard and Regency and HEP determine that it is necessary to re-
perform such Transition Service, HEP shall re-perform such Transition Service
at no additional cost or expense to Regency. To enable HEP to meet the
Performance Standard, Regency shall, and shall cause Regency Sub, the Hoover
LLCs and the Subsidiaries to, ensure that their respective employees cooperate
with HEP and provide the same level of response and information as was
provided to HEP within the twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date.

1.5 HEP shall be solely responsible for payment of compensation to its
employees engaged to provide any Transition Services. HEP shall assume full
responsibility for payment of all taxes or contributions imposed or required
under unemployment insurance, social security and income tax laws with
respect to such persons. Each of the Parties shall be solely responsible for
any injury or loss suffered by any of such Partys employees or agents in
connection with the Transition Services, including any such injury or loss
suffered at any of the facilities of the other Party, other than due to the
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the other Party.

 

1.6 HEP agrees to reasonably cooperate with, facilitate and advise Regency Sub
and its service providers in the provision of the Transition Services during
the term of this Agreement and transition to Regency Sub and its service
providers independent provision of such Transition Services, as the case may
be, as reasonably requested by Regency during the term of this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, (a) the provision of relevant
output data in HEPs standard system format to Regency Sub or its service
providers, and (b) making appropriate personnel from HEP or affiliates
available for periods of time as set forth in the Services Schedule to
facilitate the provision of the Transition Services, based on the costs sets
forth in the Service Schedule.

 

1.7 Each of the Parties shall keep books and records of the Transition
Services provided or received and reasonable supporting documentation of all
charges and expenses incurred and paid in providing or receiving such
Transition Services and shall produce written records that verify the dates
and times during which the Transition Services were performed. Each Party
shall make such books and records reasonably available to the other Party (a)
at the cost of the other Party, (b) upon reasonable notice, during normal
business hours and at the principal office of the Party making such books and
records available, and (c) subject to reasonably imposed security protocols,
limitations and any applicable confidentiality requirements.

 



2 1.8 HEPs provision of the Transition Services shall not be deemed a transfer
of any intellectual property rights with respect to any intellectual property
owned by HEP or its affiliates. HEP shall retain any intellectual property
rights it may have as of the date hereof. In no case shall the provision of
any Transition Service require HEP to violate any of its internal policies,
including, but not limited to, its data protection policies particularly
related to its customer information.

 

2\. _Payment; Disputes_.

 

2.1 The Monthly Transition Services Fee is due and shall be paid by Regency to
HEP on the date of this Agreement and on [March 1], 2014. If extended
pursuant to Section 3, the Monthly Transition Services Fee for such extension
is due and shall be paid by Regency to HEP on [April 1], 2014. Payments not
timely made shall bear interest per annum equal to the prime rate of
interest reported from time to time in _The Wall Street Journal_ plus three
percent (3%), calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
from the original date due over 360.

 

2.2 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the Monthly Transition
Services Fee is exclusive of any applicable sales, transfer, goods, services,
value added, gross receipts or similar taxes, fees, charges or assessments in
respect of such Transition Services (the " _Sales Taxes_ "). In addition to
the Monthly Transition Services Fee, Regency shall also pay the amount of any
applicable Sales Taxes, which HEP shall give notice to Regency of the amount
of such Sales Taxes on the date hereof. The Sales Taxes amount is due and
shall be paid by Regency on the same payment date of each Monthly Transition
Services Fee as set forth above. HEP shall timely remit any applicable Sales
Taxes to an appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined in the Contribution
Agreement) and shall be responsible for any penalties or interest imposed by
the Governmental Authority as a result of a failure to timely remit such
Sales Taxes, unless such failure is due to any failure of Regency to pay Sales
Taxes to HEP.

 

2.3 For the avoidance of doubt, Regency shall not be responsible or liable for
(a) any taxes imposed on or measured by HEPs income or profit, payroll or
other withholding taxes imposed on payments to HEP or its employees for
providing the Transition Services, and (b) any penalties or interest caused by
HEPs bad faith, willful neglect or gross negligence.

 

2.4 To the extent that the provision of any of the Transition Services to
Regency Sub under this Agreement requires any new or additional third party
consents, licenses, rights, approvals or permissions (the " _Third Party
Consents_ ") to receive and enjoy the full benefit of the Transition Services,
and to use or benefit from any deliverables or products provided
in connection therewith, HEP shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such Third Party Consents as promptly as practicable. In the event that

satisfaction by HEP of any material term, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement to be performed or satisfied by HEP and such default is not
remedied within ten (10) days of receipt by HEP of written notice from
Regency of such default, Regency may terminate this Agreement in its entirety
by delivering to HEP a notice from Regency terminating this Agreement (the "
_Regency Termination Notice_ ") not less than ten (10) days prior to the
termination date set forth in Regency Termination Notice. Any Regency
Termination Notice delivered under this Section 4.2 shall be deemed to be
withdrawn in the event that HEP cures the breach alleged in such Termination
Notice before the termination date set out in such Regency Termination Notice.

4.3 If:

 

(a) Regency fails to pay HEP undisputed charges (together with any applicable
interest as provided for herein) within ten (10) days of the date such
charges became due under this Agreement; or

(b) Regency defaults in any material respect in the due performance or

(20) days of receipt by Regency of written notice from HEP of such default or
if such default cannot be remedied within twenty (20) days, fails to take
commercially reasonable steps to remedy the default within such period and
thereafter, but in any case, such default is not remedied within thirty (30)
days from the original default;

 



4 HEP may terminate this Agreement in its entirety by delivering to Regency a

less than twenty (20) days prior to the termination date set forth in the HEP
Termination Notice if the termination is pursuant to Section 4.3(b). Any
Termination Notice delivered by the HEP under this Section 4.3 shall be deemed
to be withdrawn in the event that Regency cures the breach alleged in such
HEP Termination Notice or, if the breach cannot be cured within twenty (20)
days, takes commercially reasonable steps to cure the breach before the

and thereafter, or, such breach is cured within the above-mentioned thirty
(30) days from the original default.

 

4.4 Subject to Section 4.5, if (a) Regency delivers a Regency Termination
Notice to HEP, (b) HEP delivers a HEP Termination Notice to Regency or (c)
the Parties agree to terminate this Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed
to be terminated as of the date specified in the HEP Termination Notice,
Regency Termination Notice or as agreed by the Parties, as applicable, and,
from and after such date, each of the Parties shall be released from all
obligations under this Agreement, unless any such Party has breached this
Agreement or is in default under this Agreement at the time of termination, in
which case, such Party shall not be relieved of any liability or
responsibility for such breach or default.

4.5 Upon the termination of this Agreement, HEP shall complete any work in
progress and such termination shall not affect HEPs rights to payment for the
Transition Services so provided or require reimbursement of any portion of the
Monthly Transition Services Fee. Upon termination, if one Party holds books,
records, files or any other documents owned by the other Party, the Party
holding such items will return all books, records, files and any other
documents as directed by the other Party as soon as reasonably practicable.

5\. _Implementing Agreement; Cooperation; Point of Contact_. If, after the
date hereof, HEP and Regency mutually agree, or if it is otherwise necessary
to more fully or accurately document the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Parties shall, without further consideration, upon the request of the other
Party, execute and deliver such agreements, documents and instruments as such
requesting Party may reasonably request to consummate more effectively the
provision of the Transition Services as contemplated hereby. The Parties agree
that any such agreements, documents and instruments shall be
consistent (unless otherwise required by law) with the rights and obligations
of Regency and HEP provided for in this Agreement and shall not expand or
limit the rights and obligations of the Parties beyond those provided under
this Agreement or provide for any additional rights or obligations of the
Parties that are not provided for in this Agreement. The Parties shall
reasonably cooperate in the preparation of any agreements, documents and
instruments, which shall be prepared in a form suitable for use by the
Parties.

6\. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of Regency and HEP may transfer or assign in whole or in part its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its affiliates, and HEP
hereby consents to any collateral assignment by Regency, in whole or in part,
of its rights under this Agreement to Regencys financing sources; provided,
however, that HEPs consent to such collateral assignment by Regency shall not
be construed or 

 



5  interpreted as creating any obligation by HEP to Regencys financing sources
(to provide notice, seek consent or otherwise), or as creating any direct
rights by such financing sources against HEP, unless and until such financing
sources shall have acquired an ownership interest in Regency by foreclosure or
otherwise. In the event of any assignment permitted by this Section 6, the
assigning Party shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Each such assignee shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights
and remedies of its predecessor-in-interest hereunder. Any attempted
assignment or delegation in contravention hereof shall be null and void. 

7\. _Indemnification_.

 

7.1 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, HEP AND ITS
AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES (THE "HEP INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") SHALL HAVE NO
LIABILITY TO REGENCY OR ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS,
MANAGERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES (THE
"REGENCY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") FOR ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THE HEP
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND

6 8\. _Service Disruptions_ ;

 

8.1 _Contingency Plans_. HEP agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts,
consistent with its practices for itself and its affiliates, to avoid any
inability to provide the Transition Services. In the event of a disaster, HEP
agrees to use the same degree of care to restore the Transition Services as

scheduled downtime affecting the delivery of any Transition Services, HEP
shall provide Regency with as much advance notice as is reasonably possible
under the circumstances.

 

8.2 _Non-Performance_. Except for the occurrence of an event as discussed in
Section 10, if HEP ceases to perform in any material respect any of the
Transition Services in whole or in part for more than thirty-six (36)
consecutive hours and such non-performance has a material adverse impact on
the Hoover LLCs and the Subsidiaries (" _Interrupted Services_ "), Regency
shall promptly notify HEP of such non-performance. Upon receipt of such
written notice, (a) HEP shall have five (5) days to resume providing such
Interrupted Services or (b) if HEP is unable to resume providing
such Interrupted Services, the Parties agree to discuss in good faith a
reasonable resolution for the Interrupted Services.

association of any kind, each Party hereto being individually responsible only
for its obligations as set forth in this Agreement. All activities by HEP or

and as an independent contractor and not as an agent for the other Party.

10\. _Force Majeure_.

 

10.1 No Party shall be liable for any default or delay in the performance of
its obligations under this Agreement (other than payment obligations) if and
to the extent such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by acts
of God, fire, storm, flood, ice, lightning, explosion, power failure,
earthquake, governmental regulation or direction, acts of the public enemy,
war, rebellion, insurrection, acts of terrorism, riot, invasion, strike or
lockout or other labor conflict, failure in whole or in part of suppliers to
deliver on schedule any materials, equipment or machinery, interruption of or
delay in transportation, a national, provincial, state, regional or local
health emergency, or compliance with any applicable law, license, order or
regulation of any Governmental Authority or any contract or agreement
(collectively, the " _Force Majeure Events_ "), provided that the non-
performing Party is without fault in causing such default or delay and such
default or delay could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions and
cannot reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the
commercially reasonable use of alternate sources, work around plans or other
means.

 



8 10.2 Subject to the provisions of Section 10.3, if a Force Majeure Event
occurs, the non-performing Party shall be excused from further performance or
observance of the obligations so affected for as long as the Force Majeure
Event prevails and such Party continues to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to recommence performance or observance whenever and to whatever
extent possible without delay. Any Party so delayed in its performance shall
promptly notify the Party to whom performance is due by telephone (to be
confirmed in writing within forty-eight (48) hours of the inception of such
delay) and describe at a reasonable level of detail the circumstances causing
such delay.

10.3 If a Force Majeure Event has occurred and either Party has advised the
other Party in writing that the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement will be substantially prevented, hindered or delayed as a result of
such Force Majeure Event (each a " _Declaration of a Force Majeure Event_ "),
then the following shall apply:



     | (a) | HEP shall immediately begin to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to engage an alternate source to perform such obligations
or recommence such performance itself. HEP shall continue such efforts until
HEP recommences performance of such obligations in accordance with this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If, within thirty (30) days after delivery or receipt by HEP
of a Declaration of a Force Majeure Event, HEP has not directly or indirectly
through alternative sources recommenced performance of its obligations under
this Agreement, Regency may terminate this Agreement by notice to HEP. 
---|---|--- 

11\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all matters arising from or relating
to this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
substantive laws of the State of Texas without reference to principles of
conflicts of law.

 

12\. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Venue_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
CONSENTS TO, AND CONFERS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION UPON, THE COURTS OF THE STATE
OF TEXAS AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN
HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS, AND APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM, OVER ANY
ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, AND AGREES
NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY SUCH ACTION THAT IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH
JURISDICTION OR THAT SUCH ACTION MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN
THOSE COURTS OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY THOSE COURTS
OR THAT ITS PROPERTY IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM EXECUTION, THAT SUCH ACTION IS
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, OR THAT THE VENUE OF SUCH ACTION IS
IMPROPER. SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH ACTION MAY BE SERVED ON ANY PARTY
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, WHETHER WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE STATE OF TEXAS, AS
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

 



9 13\. _Prevailing Party_. If any litigation or other court action is commenced
by any Party to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other
Party, all fees, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by the prevailing Party in such
litigation, action, arbitration, or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the
losing Party; provided, that if a Party to such litigation or action prevails
in part, and loses in part, the court or other adjudicator presiding over such
litigation or action shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such Party on an equitable basis.

14\. _Form of Payment_. All payments hereunder shall be made in United States
dollars and, unless the parties making and receiving such payments shall agree
otherwise or the provisions hereof provide otherwise, shall be received by
wire or interbank transfer of immediately available funds on the date such
payment is due to such account as the party receiving payment may designate at
least three business days prior to the proposed date of payment.

 

15\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement and the
Service Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person
or entity any rights or remedies hereunder; and (c) shall not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise. Each Party agrees that (i) no other Party
(including its agents and representatives) has made any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement to or with such Party relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than those expressly
set forth herein, and (ii) such Party has not relied upon any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than those referred to in clause (i) above. No
supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless
executed in writing by each Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver
of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

16\. _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any person or entity other than the Parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations
hereunder.

17\. _Severability_. If any provision of the Agreement is rendered or declared
illegal or unenforceable by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted
legislation or by decree of a court of last resort, HEP and Regency shall
promptly meet and negotiate substitute provisions for those rendered or
declared illegal or unenforceable, but all of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

18\. _Multiple Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or .pdf), each of which shall be deemed
an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 



10 19\. _Construction_. The Parties and their respective counsel have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
addition, each of the Parties acknowledges that it is sophisticated and has
been advised by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary,
other advisors in connection with the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties
and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
Any reference to any law will be deemed to refer to all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The
headings preceding the text of articles and sections included in this
Agreement and the headings to the schedules are for convenience only and are
not be deemed part of this Agreement or given effect in interpreting this
Agreement. References to sections, articles or schedules are to the sections,
articles or schedules contained in, referred to or attached to this Agreement,
unless otherwise specified. The word "including" means "including without
limitation." The use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender or the
singular or plural form of words will not limit any provisions of this
Agreement.

20.  _Confidentiality_. Each Party agrees that any confidential information
of the other Party received in the course of performance under this Agreement
shall be kept strictly confidential by the Parties and furthermore, agree to
use all confidential information received in connection with this Agreement
solely in connection with the provision or receipt of the Transition Services,
and for no other purpose whatsoever. If a Party is requested or required by
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process to disclose any
confidential information of the other Party received in the course of
performance under this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent legally
permitted to do so, promptly notify the Party who disclosed such confidential
information of such request or requirement and shall cooperate with such
disclosing Party such that the disclosing Party may seek an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Party is
required to disclose the confidential information the Party may disclose only
so much of the confidential information to the Party compelling disclosure as
is required by law. The Party shall exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such confidential information.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Party is requested or
required to disclose any confidential information of the other Party received
in the course of performance under this Agreement to any judicial, regulatory
or administrative body having jurisdiction over such Partys business, such
Party may disclose such confidential information and shall, to the extent
legally permitted to do so, promptly notify the Party who disclosed
such confidential information of such request or requirement.

21\. _Conflict_. In case of conflict between the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and any schedule, the terms and conditions of such schedule shall
control and govern as it relates to the Transition Services to which those
terms and conditions apply.

 

22\. _Survival_. The provisions of Sections 2, 4, 6, 7, 21 and this Section 22
shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The provisions of Section 20
shall survive until twelve (12) months following any termination of this
Agreement.

executed as of the date first written above.
