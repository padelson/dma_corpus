virtue of the Merger, will be amended and restated in its entirety to read in
the form of _Exhibit B_ , and as so amended, will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in

amended prior to the date hereof, by and among the Members (as that term is
defined therein) from time to time party thereto (the " _LLC Agreement_ ")
and the Certificate of Incorporation:

(i) each Unit (as defined in the LLC Agreement) (each an " _LLC Unit_ ") not
held by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, whether vested or unvested,
together with one Share of Class B Common Stock, will be exchanged for one
Share of Class A Common Stock (the " _Exchange_ "), which Exchange will be
consummated by way of (A) first, an automatic surrender of such LLC Units not
held by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to Opco LLC; (B) second, a
contribution by the Company to Opco LLC of a number of Shares of Class A
Common Stock equal to the number of LLC Units surrendered to Opco LLC as
described in _clause (A)_ above in exchange for the issuance by Opco LLC to
the Company of an equal number of LLC Units; and (C) third, a distribution to
each member of Opco LLC that surrendered any number of LLC Units and Class B
Common Stock to Opco LLC pursuant to Section 3.9(a)(iii) of the LLC Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby of a number of shares of Class A
Common Stock equal to the number of LLC Units so surrendered, in a transaction
treated as a "disguised sale" of partnership interests for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes between such member and the Company; and

(ii) each Share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically be canceled
immediately upon the consummation of the Exchange, such that no shares of
Class B Common Stock remain outstanding at the Effective Time.

(b) The Company Board shall take (or cause to be taken) all necessary and
appropriate actions so that all LLC Units shall be vested in full as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

equity incentive plan, inducement award program or other similar plan,

outstanding (the " _Company Equity Plans_ " and each such plan or program, a "
_Company Equity Plan_ ")) has adopted, or, as soon as practicable following
the date hereof (and, in any event, prior to the Effective Time), shall adopt,
resolutions providing that:

(i) each option to acquire Shares of Class A Common Stock (each such option,
a " _Company Stock Option_ ") and each restricted stock unit (each, a "
_Company RSU_ " and collectively with any Company Stock Options, the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not then subject to any performance or other
condition, will, automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, vest in full at the Effective Time;

(ii) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that has an exercise price per Share that is less than the
Merger Consideration will be cancelled, and the former holder

 



-3- 

    

 of such cancelled Company Stock Option will be entitled to receive (without
interest), in consideration for the cancellation of such Company Stock Option,
an amount in cash (less applicable tax withholdings pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.7_) equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the
unexercised portion of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (determined after giving effect to the accelerated vesting
described in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)(_ _i_ _)_ ) multiplied by (y) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per
Share under such Company Stock Option;

(iii) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled at the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of the holder of such Company Stock Option, and
the holder of such Company Stock Option shall not be entitled to receive any
payment in exchange for such cancellation; and

(iv) each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be cancelled, and the former holder of such cancelled
Company RSU will be entitled to receive (without interest), in consideration
for the cancellation of such Company RSU, an amount in cash (less applicable
tax withholdings pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_) equal to the product of
(x) the total number of Shares subject to (or deliverable pursuant to) such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined after giving
effect to the accelerated vesting described in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)(_ _i_
_)_ ) multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration;

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make all payments to former holders of Company Equity Awards
required under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, and in any event, no later than three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time, in accordance with the foregoing and the terms of
the applicable Company Equity Plans and applicable agreements pursuant to
which such Company Equity Awards were issued and to which the Company Equity
Awards are subject.

Section 2.4. _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has not voted to adopt this Agreement or consented to the adoption of this
Agreement in writing and properly demands appraisal rights of such Shares
pursuant to, and who has complied in all respects with, the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder
of Dissenting Shares (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or otherwise lost such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any
Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares (by the holder thereof
effectively withdrawing, failing to perfect, or otherwise losing such holders
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such Shares), then, as of the
later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such Shares
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.1(a)_, without interest, and shall not thereafter be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares.

(b) The Company shall provide Parent with prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal (including copies of such written demands), withdrawals
of such demands, and any other instruments received by the Company from
holders of Shares relating to rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to direct the conduct of all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

Section 2.5. _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") cash in an amount sufficient to pay the

 



-4- 

    

 aggregate Merger Consideration, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
timely make all payments contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_. Such cash
may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ (i)
that such investments must be in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, (ii) no such investment will relieve Parent, Merger
Sub, or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _ARTICLE
II_ , and (iii) no such investment will have maturities that could prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs. No loss incurred with respect to such investments
will decrease the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement. In the event
that the amount of cash held by the Paying Agent is insufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to
be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make all such payment
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_. The aggregate Merger Consideration as so
deposited with the Paying Agent will not be used for any purpose other than
to fund payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement. Any portion of the cash made available to the
Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent,
upon demand.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or a book-entry share
(" _Book-Entry Share_ "), which represented outstanding Shares of Class A
Common Stock that were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ _(a)_ into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal in
form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate to the Paying Agent or,
with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon adherence with the procedures
set forth in such letter of transmittal) and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and properly completed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered will be cancelled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and will not evidence any
interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other
equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

(c) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, Parent may require the Paying Agent to deliver to Parent any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that have been
made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to holders
of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders will be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat, or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Parent shall pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. If any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to
such time become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any individual, corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, association, trust, unincorporated organization, other
entity or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) ("
_Person_ ") previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the

 



-5- 

    

 Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any funds delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws. 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company or if payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, a check or wire transfer for any
cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may, in the
reasonable discretion of the Paying Agent, be issued to such transferee or
other Person if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other
similar Taxes have been paid or, to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, are
not applicable. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation will be closed, and no subsequent transfers of Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
registered. After the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer will be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in,
this _ARTICLE II_.

 

(f) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen, or destroyed,
upon the holders delivery of an affidavit of loss to the Paying Agent (and,
if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a
bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by
Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver in exchange for
the lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate.

Section 2.6. _Section 16_ _Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all necessary and appropriate action to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the related rules and regulations thereunder,
the disposition of Shares and Company Equity Awards in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any director or officer of the Company who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company and cause such disposition to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 2.7. _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and the
Paying Agent is entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Shares or Company Equity Awards such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld therefrom under the United States Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or the Treasury Regulations thereunder,
or any other Tax Law. Any compensatory amounts payable pursuant to or as
contemplated by this Agreement, including pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_,
will be remitted to the applicable payor for payment to the applicable Person
through regular payroll procedures, as applicable. To the extent that any
amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

Section 2.8. _Transfer Taxes_. If any payment of Merger Consideration pursuant
to the Merger is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it will be a
condition to such payment that (a) such Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered must be properly endorsed or must otherwise be in proper form and
(b) the Person presenting such Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying
Agent for payment must pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or must establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
required to be paid. Parent shall pay any other transfer Taxes.

Section 2.9. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the number
of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time shall have been changed into a different number of Shares or securities
or a different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Exchange and any
other exchange of LLC Units or Shares of Class B Common Stock made pursuant to
the LLC Agreement), the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to provide the holders thereof the same economic effect
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change; provided, however, that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ shall be construed to permit the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in (x) the SEC Reports filed and publicly available on or
prior to the Business Day immediately prior to the date hereof (without
giving effect to any amendment to any such SEC Reports filed after the
Business Day immediately prior to the date hereof and excluding disclosure
under the heading "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" to the
extent such disclosures are primarily predictive, cautionary or forward-
looking in nature or any other similar disclosure contained in such SEC
Reports) (other than with respect to, in the case of this _clause (x)_ , 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.4_) or
(y) the corresponding section of the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this

matter disclosed in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter
will only be deemed to be disclosed with respect to another section or
subsection to the extent to which the relationship to the matter disclosed is
reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 

Section 3.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity validly existing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and is in good standing (to the extent
that such concept is recognized in the relevant jurisdiction) under the Laws
of its respective jurisdiction of organization, with all corporate or similar
power and authority necessary to own or lease its property and conduct its
business as currently conducted. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign entity
authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business
transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except as has not had and
would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any circumstance,
fact, change, effect, event, development, inaccuracy, occurrence, or other
matter that (a) has a material adverse effect on the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), assets, operations, or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (b) prevents, or materially
impairs or delays, the consummation of the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, solely with respect to the foregoing _clause (a)_ , any circumstances,
facts, changes, effects, events, developments, inaccuracies, occurrences, or
other matters resulting from any of the following will not be deemed to
constitute a Material Adverse Effect and will be disregarded in determining
whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred: (i) matters generally
affecting the U.S. or foreign economies, financial or securities markets,
or political, legislative, or regulatory conditions, or the industry in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, except to the extent such matters
have a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, relative to the impact on other companies in the industry
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (ii) the negotiation,
execution, announcement, or pendency of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) any change in the market price or trading volume
of the Shares; _provided_ that this exception will not preclude a
determination that a matter underlying such change has resulted in or
contributed to a Material Adverse Effect; (iv) acts of war or terrorism (or
the escalation of the foregoing) or natural disasters, except to the extent
such matters have a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the impact on other companies in
the industry or

 



-7- 

    

 territory in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (v) changes in
Laws, regulations, or accounting principles, or interpretations thereof,
except to the extent such changes have a disproportionate adverse effect on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the impact on
other companies in the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate; (vi) the performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including compliance with covenants set forth herein, or
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Company at the request of
Parent (but excluding any actions taken by the Company that would result in a
breach of _Section_ __ _ 3.5_); (vii) the initiation or settlement of any
legal proceedings commenced by any Governmental Entity or which otherwise
involves any Governmental Entity, in each case in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; or (viii) any failure by
the Company to meet any internal or analyst projections or forecasts or
estimates of revenues, earnings, or other financial metrics for any period;
_provided_ that this exception will not preclude a determination that a
matter underlying such failure has resulted in or contributed to a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.2. _Organizational Documents_. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent true, correct, and complete copies of the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect (respectively,
the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ " and " _Bylaws_ "), the LLC Agreement
and any similar organizational document of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries. The Company is not in violation of the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws or the LLC Agreement, and Opco LLC is not in

outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible securities or
other similar rights, agreements, commitments or contracts of any kind to

(d) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares
that may be issued pursuant to the Company Equity Plans will be, when issued
in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable and not subject to preemptive rights.

 

(e) The outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the
Companys Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable, and all such shares of capital stock or other equity interests
are owned beneficially and of record by the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in voting rights, charges, or other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever (" _Liens_ ") other than Permitted
Liens. There are not outstanding or authorized any options or other rights to
acquire from any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or any obligations of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other equity
interests, voting securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Subsidiary Securities_ "). No
Subsidiary Securities are subject to or were issued in violation of the
preemptive rights of any stockholder or any purchase option, call option,
right of first refusal, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision of applicable Law, the organizational documents of any of the
Companys applicable Subsidiaries or any agreement to which the Company or

outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire any Subsidiary Securities, and there
are no other options, calls, warrants, or other rights, relating to
Subsidiary Securities to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a

not have any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which (i) have the right to vote or (ii) are convertible into or
are exercisable for securities having the right to vote, in each case with the
holders of Shares on any matter. Other than the LLC Agreement, there are no
voting agreements, voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other

interests having ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board
of directors or other governing body of such corporation or other legal
entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Opco LLC).

in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium, and other
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, general
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law),

thereto, enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may
be, and, to the knowledge of the Company, against the other party or parties
thereto, in each case, in accordance with its terms. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has performed or is performing in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under the Franchise Agreements and

default thereunder, and has not waived or failed to enforce any rights or
benefits thereunder, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no other party to
any of the Franchise Agreements is (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) in material breach or default thereunder, except as otherwise set forth

Franchising," as amended, 16 C.F.R., Part 436 (the " _FTC Rule_ "), the
Registration Laws and all rules, ordinances and regulations and any applicable
orders, consents, or decrees from any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction
with respect to the offer and sale of franchises by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries (including any applicable foreign Law), except as otherwise set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.18(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete

made any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, as has not had and would not be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each FDD
was prepared and maintained in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Law (including the FTC Rule) and the NASAAs 2008 Franchise
Registration and Disclosure Guidelines (the " _NASAA Guidelines_ ").

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have made all necessary filings to be

Adverse Effect, to the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any

advances or allowances to or for the benefit of any or all Franchisees that
are inconsistent with the FDDs or Franchise Agreements. Since January 1, 2017,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made to any Franchisee, or
any of the Franchisees employees or agents, or to any other Person, any
commitment to provide any special discount allowance or accommodation other

Franchisees that are prohibited by such Franchisees Franchise Agreement or

knowledge of the Company, oral notice from any Franchisee setting forth any
grounds for dispute with respect to any Franchise Agreement, and, to the

Section 5.3. _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries respective directors, officers and employees not to, and shall
instruct its and its Subsidiaries respective other Representatives not to,

knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making or submission
of any offer or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or otherwise participate in
negotiations or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
provide any non-public information to any Person (other than Parent, Merger

its and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers and employees to,
and shall instruct its and its Subsidiaries respective other Representatives
to, immediately cease any solicitation, discussions, or negotiations with any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub, or any designees of Parent or Merger
Sub) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and, to the extent the Company
has the right to do so, shall promptly request the return or destruction of
all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to any such Person and its Representatives. The Company shall
also promptly terminate such Persons and its Representatives access to any
data room relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal containing any such
information. Subject to the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the
Company and its Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify and
understand the terms and conditions of any unsolicited inquiry or proposal
made by any Person solely to determine whether such inquiry or proposal
constitutes a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and (B) inform a Person that
has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this _ Section 5.3_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any communication contemplated by the foregoing sentence
shall be solely limited to the matters contemplated by the foregoing _clauses
(A)_ and _(B)_. Any action taken or failed to be taken by any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives that provided services to the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
which, if taken or failed to be taken by the Company, would constitute a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ shall be deemed to constitute a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, (i) the Company has received a _bona
fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ and (ii) the Company Board (acting
on the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys or
the Special Committees independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, as applicable, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
, that (x) the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall
instruct its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives not to,
disclose any non-public information to such Person unless the Company entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such Person prior to the date hereof or
first enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms that,
taken as a whole, are not less favorable to the Company than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement
need not contain any standstill provisions) (any such confidentiality
agreement, an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (y) the Company
shall provide or make available to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries promptly after such
information is provided or made available to such Person but only to the
extent such information was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. The Company agrees that it and its Affiliates will not enter into any
agreement with any Person following the date hereof (including any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) which prevents the Company from complying with, or
otherwise restricts or interferes with the Companys ability to comply with,
its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

 



-34- 

    

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours) notify Parent (orally or in writing) of the receipt by the Company of
(i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any written indication by any Person that
it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any _bona fide_
offer, proposal or inquiry (whether written or oral) that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent
promptly (and in any event by the end of such forty-eight (48) hour period)
the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, indication,
offer, proposal or inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication, offer or proposal or, if not in writing, a
written description of the material terms thereof). The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis as to the status of
any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, offer, proposal or inquiry.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, none of the Company Board
or any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) shall, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or any other
agreement (including any joint venture agreement, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement) (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) relating to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (ii) make a Change of Board
Recommendation or (iii) resolve, publicly propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

Agreement, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained:

(i) the Company Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee)
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ to enter
into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal if
(A) the Company receives a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_ that the Company Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special
Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys or the Special Committees independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, as applicable, constitutes a
Superior Proposal; (B) the Company delivers to Parent a Determination Notice
notifying Parent that it intends to take such action; (C) during the Notice
Period, the Company has, and has caused its Representatives to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives (to the extent Parent requests) to consider amendments or
modifications to this Agreement; (D) in the event of any change to the
financial terms or the other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall have delivered an additional Determination Notice; and (E) no
earlier than the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board (acting on the
recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines
in good faith, after taking into consideration the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement that Parent has irrevocably
committed to make during the Notice Period and after consultation with the
Companys or the Special Committees independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, as applicable, that the Acquisition Proposal that is subject
of the Determination Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(ii) The Company Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee)
or the Special Committee may make a Change of Board Recommendation if (A) the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not directly result from a
material breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ and the Company Board (acting on
the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys or the Special
Committees independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, as
applicable, constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) the Company has notified
Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation;
(C) during the Notice Period, the Company has, and has instructed its
Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good
faith with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent requests) to
consider amendments or modifications to this Agreement; (D) in the event of
any change to the financial terms or the other material terms of such
Superior Proposal, the

 



-35- 

    

 Company shall have delivered an additional Determination Notice; and (E) no
earlier than the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board (acting on the
recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines
in good faith, after taking into consideration the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement that Parent has irrevocably
committed to make during the Notice Period and after consultation with the
Companys or the Special Committees independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, as applicable, that the Acquisition Proposal that is subject of
the Determination Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
and

 

(iii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
(acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee may make a Change of Board Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event if (A) the Company delivers to Parent a Determination Notice
notifying Parent that it intends to make a Change of Board
Recommendation; (B) during the Notice Period, the Company has, and has
instructed its Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent
Parent requests) to consider amendments or modifications to this Agreement;
and (C) no earlier than the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board
(acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee determines in good faith, after taking into consideration the terms
of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement that Parent has
irrevocably committed to make during the Notice Period and after consultation
with the Companys or the Special Committees outside legal counsel, as
applicable, that the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

committee thereof from (A) taking and disclosing to the holders of Shares a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the

applicable Law; or (ii) the Company or the Company Board from making any

Section 5.4. _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its other
Subsidiaries to, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time, maintain for each
individual employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective
Time (each, a " _Current Employee_ ") (i) each of base compensation and a
target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity at least as favorable as
that provided to the Current Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) benefits that are at least as favorable in the aggregate as
the benefits maintained for and provided to the Current Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) severance benefits that are
at least as favorable as the severance benefits provided by the Company to the
Current Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its other Subsidiaries to honor and assume
all severance obligations pursuant to the terms and conditions of any existing
employment agreements and offer letters with the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, and any other agreements or arrangements, disclosed in
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by Current Employees to the Company and its Subsidiaries, prior to
the Effective Time to be taken into account for all purposes under employee
benefit plans of Parent or its Affiliates (the " _Parent Plans_ "), the
Surviving Corporation, and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such
service was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to benefits under a defined benefit pension plan or to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to not, and to
cause the Surviving Corporation to not, subject Current Employees to any
eligibility requirements, waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations under any Parent Plans or employee benefits
plans of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for
which they would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding
Company Plan in which they participated prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Current Employee to be given
credit under the Parent Plans that are group health plans for any eligible
expenses incurred by such Current Employees and their covered dependents
under a Company Plan during the portion of the year prior to the Effective
Time for purposes of satisfying all co-payment, co-insurance,
deductibles, maximum out-of-pocket requirements, and other out-of-pocket
expenses applicable to such Current Employees and their covered dependents in
respect of the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. Unless Parent,
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries are required under applicable Law to
make a payment in settlement of vacation time of a Current Employee, as of
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to credit to each Current Employee the amount of vacation
time that such employee had accrued under any applicable Company Plan or
under applicable Law as of the date of Closing.

(d) Unless otherwise notified by Parent no less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, take all actions that are necessary or appropriate to deliver
to Parent written resolutions duly adopted and authorizing, contingent on
the consummation of the Merger, the termination of each Company Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, effective as of no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, no provision of
this Agreement (i) constitutes the establishment or adoption of, or amendment
to, any Company Plan or employee benefit plan, (ii) creates any third-party
beneficiary or other rights in any current or former employee, director,
officer or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, or (iii) creates any rights to
continued employment with the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or
any other Person or in any way limits the ability of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to
terminate the employment of any individual at any time or for any reason.

Section 5.5. _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities
of present and former directors, officers, and employees of the Company than
are currently provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which
provisions may not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals for
a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and in the event that any
Proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until
the disposition of any such Proceeding or claim, unless such amendment,
modification, or repeal is required by applicable Law, in which case Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, make such changes to the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws as to have the least adverse
effect on the rights of the individuals referenced in this  _Section_ __ _
5.5_.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
agreement or Company Plan, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present
(as of the Effective Time) or former director or officer of the Company (each,
together with such Persons heirs, executors, or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), against all obligations to pay a judgment, settlement,
or penalty, and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or
investigative, and whether formal or informal, arising out of or pertaining to
any action or omission occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, including
any action or omission in connection with the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary, or agent of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, or of another entity if such service was at the request
of the Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent the Surviving Corporation would be
permitted under the DGCL. In the event of any such Proceeding, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall advance to each Indemnified Party reasonable
expenses incurred in the defense of the Proceeding ( _provided_ that any
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced shall have provided, to the
extent required by the DGCL, an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
finally determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may purchase prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company does not
purchase prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to purchase at or after the Effective Time, a tail policy with
respect to the current directors and officers liability insurance policies
(" _D andO Insurance_") maintained as of the date hereof by the Company, which
tail policy (i) will be effective for a period from the Effective Time through
and including the date six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at
the Effective Time, (ii) will contain coverage that is at least as protective
to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by such existing
policies and (iii) may be obtained from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the insurance carrier of such directors and officers
liability insurance policies; _provided_ that the Company shall not, and the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation to, purchase any such
policy to the extent the premium for such tail policy exceeds three hundred
percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company with respect
to the DandO Insurance prior to the date hereof. Parent shall cause such tail
policy to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term, and cause
all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) Without limiting any of the rights or obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 5.5_, the Surviving Corporation shall keep each of the indemnification
agreements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The Company
has provided Parent true, correct and complete copies of each such agreement,
or such agreement has been filed with the SEC and is publicly available on or
prior to the Business Day immediately prior to the date hereof.

 

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
is intended to benefit, and is enforceable by, any Person referred to in this

the Proxy Statement from the SEC, but not without first providing Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and propose comments thereon, which comments
shall be considered in good faith by the Company. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Shares promptly after the
resolution of any comments thereon from the SEC or, if the SEC does not inform
the

 Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement on or before the tenth
(10th) calendar day following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement,
promptly following such tenth (10th) calendar day.

Approval, regardless of whether the Company Board or any committee thereof
(including the Special Committee) has effected a Change of Board
Recommendation. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
its terms or except to the extent that the Company Board or the Special
Committee shall have made a Change of Board Recommendation, the Company Board
shall recommend such adoption and include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
such adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to such solicitation. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company may not adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting except (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required to be sent by
applicable Law or at the request of the SEC or its staff is provided to the
holders of Shares at least five (5) Business Days in advance of a vote on the
adoption of this Agreement in order to give the holders of Shares sufficient
time to evaluate any information or disclosure contained in such supplement or
amendment, (ii) in the event any Acquisition Proposal is structured as a
tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act, to the
extent necessary to ensure that the Company shall have ten (10) Business Days
after the commencement thereof to take or disclose to the holders of Shares a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act at
least five (5) Business Days in advance of a vote on the adoption of this
Agreement, (iii) if the Company reasonably believes it is necessary and
advisable to do so in order to solicit additional proxies in order to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, or (iv) if, as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders
Meeting; provided, however, that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not
be adjourned or postponed pursuant to the foregoing clauses (iii) and (iv) (A)

delayed), except any release or announcement required by applicable Law or any
rule or regulation of Nasdaq or any other stock exchange to which the relevant
party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance; it being understood that the final form and content of any such
release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final

7.4(b)_; or

 

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ (but only if at such time Parent had the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_) or
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_ or (2) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.4(a)_ (arising solely from a breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Company), (B) any Person has publicly disclosed an Acquisition Proposal after
the date hereof and has not publicly withdrawn such Acquisition Proposal, in
each case prior to (x) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.2(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_, such termination or (y) in the case of

be made (1) pursuant to _clause (i)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_ will be

Parents right to receive a termination fee is the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub in respect of any breach of, or inaccuracy contained
in, the Companys covenants, agreements, representations, or warranties in
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply in
the event of a material Intentional Breach by the Company.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in  _Section_ __ _
7.5(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b) _and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in
a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in  _Section_ __ _
7.5(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub interest on such amount
at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

Section 7.6. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
each party will bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.7. _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment shall require further approval of
the holders of Shares, the effectiveness of such amendment shall be subject to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval with respect to such amendment. At
any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance by the other with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver will
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or
remedies will not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court

EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN

referred to in _Section_ __ _ 8.10(a)_ in any such action or proceeding by
mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to

Section 8.12. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any breach

entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law
or in equity, to seek to compel specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement in any action
without the posting of a bond or undertaking, and (ii) the parties hereto
shall, and hereby do, waive, in any action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and any other objections to specific
performance of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the parties rights to specific performance pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.12(a)_, each party may pursue any other remedy available to
it at law or in equity, including monetary damages; _provided_ that it is
understood and agreed that claims for monetary damages following termination
of this Agreement shall be (i) limited to those arising from or relating to
any Intentional Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination and (ii)
subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, no party hereto is permitted to make any claim or
commence any Proceeding seeking monetary damages against any other party
hereto in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger;
_provided_ that the foregoing is without prejudice to the right of any party
to seek such monetary damages following such termination in accordance with,
and subject to the limitations set forth in, this Agreement.

Section 8.13. _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference will be to a Section of this Agreement unless

are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto," and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will refer

Agreement. The word "or" will not be exclusive. Whenever used in this
Agreement, any noun or pronoun will be deemed to include the plural as well as
the singular and to cover all genders. This Agreement will be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted. Time is of the essence with respect to the performance of the
obligations set forth in this Agreement and the provisions hereof will be
interpreted as such.

meeting.

(b) The stockholders may elect the board of directors by written consent in

 delivered to the chairman of the board or the president. The chairman of the
board or the president, as the case may be, shall fix a date, time and place
for the meeting as promptly as practicable following receipt of the written
request.

2.3 REMOTE COMMUNICATION

 

The board of directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that a
stockholders meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held
solely by means of remote communication. Further, the board of directors may,
in its sole discretion, authorize stockholders and proxyholders not physically
present at a meeting of stockholders to, by means of remote communication and
subject to such guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may
adopt: (a) participate in a meeting of stockholders and (b) be deemed present
in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such meeting is to be
held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication. If the
board of directors authorizes a meeting solely by remote communication or
authorizes presence, participation and voting at a meeting by means of remote
communication, the corporation must (i) implement reasonable measures to
verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by
means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder, (ii) implement
reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters
submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the
proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings,

2.4 NOTICE OF MEETINGS

Except as provided in Section 230 of the General Corporation Law of the State

or special meeting of the stockholders shall be given to each stockholder
entitled to vote at the meeting. The notice (i) shall state the place, if
any, date, time, means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for
which the meeting is called, (ii) shall be given not less than 10 days nor
more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, and (iii) shall be given in
a manner provided by and subject to Article 9 of these bylaws.

2.5 STOCKHOLDERS LIST

 

At least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, the officer having
charge of the stock ledger shall prepare a complete list of the stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting. The list must be arranged in alphabetical
order and show the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of the stockholder. Electronic mail addresses or
other electronic contact information need not be included on the list. The
list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose
germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting:
(a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to the list is provided with the notice of
the meeting or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the corporation. In the event the corporation determines to make
the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place,
then the list shall be produced and kept at the place of the meeting during
the whole time of the meeting, and may be inspected by any stockholder
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication,
then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting.

 

2.6 QUORUM

The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled
to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall be requisite for,
and shall constitute, a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders of

 



C-2

    

 the corporation for the transaction of business, except as otherwise
required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. If,
however, a separate vote by class or series is required with respect to any
matter, the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or series, as
the case may be, shall constitute a quorum (as to such class or series) with
respect to the matter. If a quorum is not present or represented at
any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting present in person or represented by proxy shall have power to adjourn
the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present or represented.

 

2.7 ADJOURNED MEETINGS

When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, notice need not be
given of the adjourned meeting if its time and place, if any, and the means of
remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at the adjourned meeting, are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned
meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder
of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 

2.8 VOTE REQUIRED

Except as otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation, or
these bylaws, when a quorum is present at a meeting: (a) the affirmative vote
of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled
to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders; and (b)
where a separate vote by class or series is required, the affirmative vote of
the majority of shares of such class or series present in person or
represented by proxy shall be the act of such class or series.

2.9 PROXIES

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. No
proxy may be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the
proxy provides for a longer period. At each meeting of the stockholders, and
before any voting commences, all proxies filed at or before the meeting shall
be submitted to and examined by the secretary or a person designated by the
secretary. No shares may be represented or voted under a proxy that has been
found to be invalid or irregular.

 

Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize a proxy, the
following shall constitute valid means of doing so:

 

(a) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person to act for
the stockholder as proxy. Either the stockholder or the stockholders
authorized officer, director, employee or agent may sign the writing.
Alternatively, such person may cause his or her signature to be affixed to the
writing by any reasonable means, including facsimile signature.

 

(b) A stockholder may authorize another person to act for the stockholder as
proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram,
cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be
the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service
organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the
holder of the proxy to receive such transmission. Any such transmission must
either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the stockholder authorized the transmission. If it is
determined that the transmission is valid, the inspectors or, if there are no
inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the
information upon which they relied.

 

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of such
writing or transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the original
writing or transmission for all purposes for which the original writing

 



C-3

    

 or transmission could be used, provided that the reproduction is a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

 

2.10 VOTING OF CERTAIN SHARES

With respect to shares entitled to vote:

(a) Shares standing in the name of another corporation or other entity,
domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent, or proxy as the (i)
bylaws or other governing document of such corporation or entity may prescribe
or, (ii) in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors or other
governing body of such corporation or entity may determine.

(b) Shares held in a fiduciary capacity may be voted by the fiduciary.

 

(c) Shares standing in the name of a trustee, receiver or pledgee may be voted
by such trustee, receiver or pledgee either in person or by proxy as provided
by statute.

If the shares stand of record in the names of two or more persons, whether
fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common,
tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same
fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the secretary of the
corporation is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a
copy of the instrument or order appointing such persons or creating the
relationship, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following
effect:

 

if only one votes, the voters act binds all;

 

(d) if more than one vote, the act of the majority so voting binds all;

 

(e) if more than one vote, but the vote is evenly split on any particular
matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionately
unless otherwise ordered by a court having jurisdiction.

If the instrument so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal
interests, a majority or even split shall be a majority or even split in
interest.

2.11 ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT OR ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION

(a) Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, any
action required or permitted to be taken at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders may be taken by written consent without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, as follows:

 

(i) The holders of outstanding capital stock of the corporation having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted must sign and date the written consent setting forth the action so
taken. Consents may be executed in counterparts.

 

(ii) The consent(s) must be delivered to the corporations registered office
in Delaware, to its principal place of business, or to an officer or agent of
the corporation having custody of the book(s) in which proceedings of meetings
of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the registered office must
be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and
will be deemed delivered upon actual receipt by the registered office.

(b) All consents properly delivered in accordance with this section shall be
deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective

cablegram or other electronic transmission. The stockholder, the proxyholder
or a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder
must transmit the consent. The consent shall be deemed to be written, signed
and dated if the transmission sets forth or is delivered with information
from which the corporation can determine (i) that the transmission was
transmitted by the stockholder, proxyholder or authorized person(s), and (ii)
the date on which it was transmitted. The date on which the transmission is
transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which the consent was signed. No
consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been

with Section 2.11(a), _provided, however_ , that it may be otherwise delivered
to the principal place of business of the corporation or to an officer or
agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings
of meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner
provided by the board of directors.

(d) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in

purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that the
reproduction is of the entire original writing.

 

(e) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who
have not consented in writing and who, if action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such
meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number
of holders to take the action were delivered to the corporation as provided
above.

2.12 TREASURY STOCK

 

Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election
of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by
such corporation, shall not be entitled to vote nor counted for quorum
purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation may vote shares of
its own stock that it holds in a fiduciary capacity.

ARTICLE 3

 

DIRECTORS

3.1 NUMBER, ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE

The board of directors shall consist of not less than one nor more than five
members, which number shall be fixed from time to time by action of the board
of directors or the stockholders. The initial board of directors shall consist
of one director. Except as provided in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, the directors
shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders. Elections of
directors need not be by written ballot unless the board of directors votes to
require a written ballot. If the election is to be by written ballot, then, if
the board of directors authorizes it, a ballot submitted by
electronic transmission may satisfy the requirement of a written ballot. Any
such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with
information from which the corporation can determine that it was authorized by
the stockholder or proxyholder. The directors shall be elected by a plurality
of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote in the election of directors. Each director shall
hold office until such directors successor is duly elected and qualified or
until such directors earlier death, resignation or removal as hereinafter
provided.

3.2 MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS OF CORPORATION

The property and business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the
direction of its board of directors. The board of directors may exercise all
such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are
not reserved exclusively to the stockholders by law, the certificate of
incorporation or these bylaws.

 



C-5

    

3.3 RESIGNATIONS AND VACANCIES

 

Any director may resign at any time by giving notice to the board of
directors, the chairman of the board or the president in writing or
by electronic transmission. Any such resignation shall take effect on the
date of the receipt of the notice or at any later time specified in the
notice. Acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective. If, at any time other than the annual meeting of the stockholders,
any vacancy occurs in the board of directors or any new directorship is
created by an increase in the authorized number of directors, a majority of
the directors then in office (even if less than a quorum) may choose a
successor or fill the newly created directorship. Unless removed sooner, the
director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election of
directors by the stockholders and until such directors successor is
duly elected and qualified. Whenever the certificate of incorporation
entitles holders of any class or series of stock to elect one or more
directors, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or series
may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or series
then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.

3.4 REMOVAL AND VACANCIES

 

Any director or the entire board of directors may be removed by the holders of
a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors
except as follows: (a) if the stockholders are entitled to exercise cumulative
voting rights, then no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast
against such directors removal would be sufficient to elect such director if
then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors, and
(b) if there are classes of directors, then the stockholders may effect such
removal only for cause. The successor to any director so removed may
be elected at the meeting at which the removal was effectuated. The remaining
directors may fill any remaining vacancies created by the removal. Whenever
the holders of any class or series are entitled to elect one or more directors
by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, the provisions of this
section shall apply, in respect to the removal without cause of a director or
directors so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of
that class or series and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a
whole.

3.5 ANNUAL AND REGULAR MEETINGS

 

The annual meeting of the board of directors shall be held, without other
notice than this bylaw, immediately after, and at the same place as, the
annual meeting of the stockholders. Regular meetings of the board of
directors, other than the annual meeting, may be held at such time and at such
place as the board may from time to time fix by resolution and no notice
(other than the resolution) need be given as to any regular meeting.

3.6 SPECIAL MEETINGS

 

Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by the chairman of
the board or the president and shall be called by the secretary at the
request of any director, to be held at such time and place, either within or

the time of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law or these bylaws,
meetings may be held at any time without notice if all of the directors are
present or if, at any time before or after the meeting, those not
present waive notice of the meeting in writing.

the board of directors, the presence of not less than a majority of the whole
board shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business; and (b) the act of a majority of the directors
present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the
board of directors. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of directors,
the directors present may adjourn the meeting, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.

 

3.9 COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, any member
of the board of directors or of any committee designated by the board may
participate in a meeting of the directors or committee by means of conference
telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a
meeting by means of such equipment shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting.

 

3.10 PRESUMPTION OF ASSENT

Unless applicable law provides otherwise, a director of the corporation who
is present at a meeting of the board of directors at which action is taken on
any corporate matter shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken
unless: (a) the directors dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting;
or (b) the director files a written dissent to the action with the person
acting as secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or forwards
the dissent by registered mail to the secretary of the corporation
immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to dissent shall
not apply to a director who voted in favor of any action.

 

3.11 ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a
meeting, if all members of the board or of such committee, as the case may
be, consent to the action in writing or by electronic transmission, and the

disqualified from voting, whether or not such members constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the
meeting in place of the absent or disqualified member.

3.15 QUORUM AND MANNER OF ACTINGCOMMITTEES

 

The presence of a majority of members of any committee shall constitute a

the act of a majority of those present shall be necessary for the taking of
any action at the meeting.

3.16 COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, BOOKS AND RECORDS, ETC.

The chairman of each committee shall be selected by the board of directors
from among the members of the committee. Each committee shall fix its own

of attendance, may be allowed for attendance at each regular or special
meeting of the board. Members of the board shall be allowed their reasonable
traveling expenses when actually engaged in the business of the
corporation. Members of any committee may be allowed like fees and expenses
for attending committee meetings. Nothing in these bylaws shall be construed
to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity
and receiving compensation therefor.

3.18 RELIANCE UPON RECORDS

 

Every director of the corporation, or member of any committee designated by
the board of directors, shall, in the performance of such directors duties,
be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the
corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements
presented to the corporation by any of the corporations officers or
employees, or committees of the board of directors, or by any other person as
to matters the director reasonably believes are within such other persons
professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable
care by or on behalf of the corporation.

clerk acting on behalf of the corporation and a registrar, the signature of
any officer of the corporation may be facsimile. In case any officer whose
facsimile signature has thus been used on any such certificate shall cease to
be such officer before the certificate has been issued, the certificate may
nevertheless be issued with the same effect as if he or she were such officer
at the date of issue. All certificates properly surrendered to the

Section 7.2 below, no new certificate shall be issued to evidence transferred
shares until the former certificate for at least a like number of shares has

applicable taxes on the transfer.

7.2 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES

 

The corporation may direct a new certificate or uncertificated shares to be
issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the corporation
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and may also require the owner

representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it
against any claim that may be made against the corporation on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate or the issuance of a
new certificate or uncertificated shares.

 

7.3 TRANSFERS OF STOCK

Transfers of shares of stock shall be made only on the books of the

duly authorized as evidenced by documents filed with the secretary or transfer
agent of the corporation. Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer
agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or
accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to
transfer, and in compliance with any restrictions on transfer of which the
corporation has notice applicable to the certificate or shares represented
thereby, the corporation shall issue a new certificate to the person entitled
thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon
its books. The board of directors may adopt such additional rules and
regulations as it deems advisable concerning the transfer and registration of
certificates of stock of the corporation.

 

7.4 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER

Any stockholder may enter into an agreement with other stockholders or with
the corporation providing for any reasonable restriction on the right of such
stockholder to transfer shares of stock of the corporation held by such
stockholder. If such restriction is set forth conspicuously on the
certificates representing the shares or, in the case of uncertificated shares,
is contained in a notice sent pursuant to Section 151(f) of the Delaware GCL,
the corporation or the transfer agent shall not be required to transfer such
shares upon the books of the corporation without receipt of satisfactory
evidence of compliance with the terms of such restriction.

(a) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment

not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more
than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record
date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

 

(b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of
directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of
directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of
directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of
directors is required, shall be the first date on which a signed written
consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to
the corporation by delivery to its registered office, its principal place of
business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book
in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record
date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board
of directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be
at the close of business on the day the board of directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action.

(c) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to
such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

 

7.6 STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD

The corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any shares
of stock as the holder in fact of such shares. Accordingly, the corporation
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in
such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it has express or
other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by Delaware law.

ARTICLE 8

to be made, a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he

serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee,
member, trustee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust, nonprofit entity or other enterprise (including, but not
limited to, service with respect to employee benefit plans) (any such entity,
an " _Other Entity_ "), against all liability and loss suffered (including,
but not limited to, expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys fees
and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding).
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the corporation shall be required to
indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof)
commenced by such Indemnitee only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or
part thereof) by the Indemnitee was authorized by the Board of Directors of
the corporation or the Proceeding (or part thereof) relates to the enforcement
of the corporations obligations under this Section 8.1.

8.2 ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

 

The corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law
pay, on an as-incurred basis, all expenses (including, but not limited to
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition. Such advancement shall be
unconditional, unsecured and interest free and shall be made without regard
to Indemnitees ability to repay any expenses advanced; provided, however,
that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
unsecured undertaking by the Indemnitee to repay all amounts advanced if it
should be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Section 8 or otherwise.

 

8.3 CLAIMS

If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such
proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Section 8 is not paid in
full within sixty days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnitee has
been received by the corporation, the Indemnitee may file suit to recover the
unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be
entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest
extent permitted by law. In any such action the corporation shall have the
burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to the requested
indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.

 

8.4 INSURANCE

The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee,
member, trustee or agent of the corporation, or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of an
Other Entity, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred
by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as
such, whether or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation
to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
Section 8 or the Delaware GCL.

8.5 NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS

The rights conferred on any Indemnitee by this Section 8 are not exclusive of
other rights arising under any bylaw, agreement, vote of directors or
stockholders or otherwise, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and
legal representatives of such Indemnitee.

 

8.6 AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM AN OTHER ENTITY

 

Subject to Section 8.7, the corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify or
to advance expenses to any Indemnitee who was or is serving at the
corporations request as a director, officer, employee or agent of an Other
Entity shall be reduced by any amount such Indemnitee may collect as
indemnification or advancement of expenses from such Other Entity.

8.7 INDEMNIFICATION PRIORITY

 

As between the corporation and any other person (other than an entity directly
or indirectly controlled by the corporation) who provides indemnification to
the Indemnitees for their service to, or on behalf of, the corporation
(collectively, the " _Secondary Indemnitors_ ") (i) the corporation shall be
the full indemnitor of first resort in respect of indemnification or
advancement of expenses in connection with any Jointly Indemnifiable Claims
(as defined below), pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Section 8, irrespective of any right of indemnification, advancement
of expenses or other right of recovery any Indemnitee may have from any
Secondary Indemnitor or any right to insurance coverage that Indemnitee may
have under any insurance policy issued to any Secondary Indemnitor (i.e., the
corporations obligations to such Indemnitees are primary and any obligation
of any Secondary Indemnitor, or any insurer of any Secondary Indemnitor, to
advance expenses or to provide indemnification or insurance coverage for the
same loss or liability incurred by such Indemnitees is secondary to the
corporations obligations), (ii) the corporation shall be required to advance
the full amount of expenses incurred by any such Indemnitee and shall be
liable for the full amount of all liability and loss suffered by such
Indemnitee (including, but not limited to, expenses (including, but not
limited to, attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee
in connection with such Proceeding), without regard to any rights any such
Indemnitee may have against any Secondary Indemnitor or against any insurance
carrier providing insurance coverage to Indemnitee under any insurance policy
issued to a Secondary Indemnitor, and (iii) the corporation irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases each Secondary Indemnitor from any and all
claims against such Secondary Indemnitor for contribution, subrogation or any
other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The corporation shall
indemnify each Secondary Indemnitor directly for any amounts that such
Secondary Indemnitor pays as indemnification or advancement on behalf of any
such Indemnitee and for which such Indemnitee may be entitled
to indemnification from the corporation in connection with Jointly
Indemnifiable Claims. No right of indemnification, advancement of expenses or
other right of recovery that an Indemnitee may have from any Secondary
Indemnitor shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of the Indemnitee or
the obligations of the corporation hereunder. No advancement or payment by any
Secondary Indemnitor on behalf of any such Indemnitee with respect to any
claim for which such Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the
corporation shall affect the foregoing and the Secondary Indemnitors shall be
subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights
of recovery of such Indemnitee against the corporation. Each Indemnitee shall
execute all papers reasonably required and shall do all things that may be
reasonably necessary to secure the rights of such Indemnitees Secondary
Indemnitors under this Section 8.7, including the execution of such documents
as may be necessary to enable the Secondary Indemnitors effectively to bring
suit to enforce such rights, including in the right of the corporation. Each
of the Secondary Indemnitors shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect
to this Section 8.7, entitled to enforce this Section 8.7. As used in this
Section 8.7, the term " _Jointly Indemnifiable Claims_ " shall be broadly
construed and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit, proceeding
or other matter for which an Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification,
reimbursement, advancement of expenses or insurance coverage from both a
Secondary Indemnitor (or an insurance carrier providing insurance coverage to
any Secondary Indemnitor) and the corporation, whether pursuant to Delaware
law (or other applicable law in the case of any Secondary Indemnitor), any
agreement or certificate of incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreement,
operating agreement, certificate of formation, certificate of
limited partnership or other organizational or governing documents of the
corporation or the Secondary Indemnitors or any insurance policy providing
insurance coverage to any Secondary Indemnitor, as applicable.

 

8.8 AMENDMENT OR REPEAL

Any right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses of any Indemnitee
arising hereunder shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to or
repeal of this Section 8 after the occurrence of the act or omission that is
the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action,
suit, proceeding or other matter for which indemnification or advancement of
expenses is sought.

 



C-15

    

8.9 OTHER INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

 

This Section 8 shall not limit the right of the corporation, to the extent and
in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to
persons other than Indemnitees when and as authorized by appropriate corporate
action.

8.10 RELIANCE

 

Indemnitees who after the date of the adoption of this Section 8 become or
remain an Indemnitee described in Section 8.1 will be conclusively presumed
to have relied on the rights to indemnity, advancement of expenses and other
rights contained in this Section 8 in entering into or continuing the service.
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in
this Section 8 will apply to claims made against any Indemnitee described in
Section 8.1 arising out of acts or omissions that occurred or occur either
before or after the adoption of this Section 8 in respect of service as a
director or officer of the corporation or other service described in Section
8.1.

8.11 SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE

 

In the event that any proceeding to which an Indemnitee is a party is resolved
in any manner other than by adverse judgment against the Indemnitee
(including, without limitation, settlement of such proceeding with or without
payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that the
Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such proceeding
for purposes of Section 145(c) of the Delaware GCL. Anyone seeking to
overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of
persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.

 

ARTICLE 9

NOTICE 

9.1 MANNER OF NOTICE

Whenever under law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws notice
is required to be given to any stockholder, director or member of any
committee of the board of directors, it shall not be construed to require
personal delivery. Such notice also may be given in writing by depositing it
in the United States mail (postage prepaid), by express overnight courier, or
by facsimile or other electronic transmission. For purposes of these bylaws,
"electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly
involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may
be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be
directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated
process.

9.2 NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION

 

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation shall be
effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the
stockholder to whom notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by
the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent
shall be deemed revoked if (a) the corporation is unable to deliver by
electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in
accordance with such consent and (b) such inability becomes known to the
secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or the transfer agent,
or other person responsible for giving of notice; provided, however, the
inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not
invalidate any meeting or other action.

 

9.3 EFFECTIVENESS OF NOTICE

Notice given by mail shall be deemed to be given at the time it is deposited
in the United States mail. Notice given by overnight courier service shall be
deemed to be given when delivered to the overnight courier service for 

 



C-16

    

 delivery. Notice given by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall
be deemed given: (a) if by facsimile transmission, when directed to a number
at recipient has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when
directed to an electronic mail address at which the recipient has consented to
receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with
separate notice to the recipient of such specific posting, upon the later of
(i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by
any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the recipient. An
affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent
or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of
electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein. The requirement for notice shall be
deemed satisfied, except in the case of a stockholder meeting with respect to
which written notice is required by law, if actual notice is received orally
or in writing by the person entitled thereto as far in advance of the event
with respect to which notice is given as the minimum notice period required
by law or these bylaws.

9.4 WAIVER OF NOTICE

 

Whenever under law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws notice is
required to be given, a waiver thereof in writing signed by the person or
persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the
person entitled to notice, whether before, at or after the time stated
therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance by a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders, directors or committee of directors need be specified in any
written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission, unless so
required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
