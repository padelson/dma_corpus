jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this _Section 9.4_ is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that

term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be

to Buyer shall thereafter be appointed by an instrument in writing signed by
such successor Sellers' Representative and by the Sellers, and such
appointment shall become effective as to any such successor Sellers'
Representative when a copy of such instrument shall have been delivered to
Buyer.

(b) _Authority_. The Sellers' Representative is hereby authorized and
empowered to act for, and on behalf of, any or all of the Sellers and ILTS
(with full power of substitution in the premises) in connection with this
agreement and such other matters as are reasonably necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions including, without limitation, (i) to receive
all payments owing to the Sellers and ILTS under this Agreement, (ii) to
terminate, amend, waive any provision of, or abandon, this Agreement or any
other agreement entered into in connection herewith, (iii) to act as the
representative of the Sellers and ILTS to review and authorize all claims and
disputes or question the accuracy thereof, (iv) to negotiate and compromise on
their behalf with Buyer any claims asserted thereunder and to authorize
payments to be made with respect thereto, (v) to take such further actions as
are authorized in this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in
connection therewith, and (vi) in general, do all things and perform all
acts deemed by the Sellers' Representative to be necessary or desirable in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Buyer shall be entitled
to rely on such appointment and to treat the Sellers' Representative as the
duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Seller and ILTS. The Sellers and ILTS
shall cooperate with the Sellers' Representative and any accountants,
attorneys or other agents whom it may retain to assist in carrying out its
duties hereunder. Each Seller and ILTS by execution of this Agreement, and
without any further action, confirms such appointment and authority. Notices
given to the Sellers' Representative in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement shall constitute notice to the Sellers for all purposes under
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Extent and Survival of Authority_. The appointment of the
Sellers' Representative is an agency coupled with an interest and
is irrevocable and any action taken by the Sellers' Representative pursuant
to the authority granted in this _Section 11.1_ shall be effective and
absolutely binding on each Seller and ILTS notwithstanding any contrary action
of or direction from such Seller or ILTS, except for actions or omissions of
the Sellers' Representative constituting willful misconduct or gross
negligence. The death or incapacity, or dissolution or other termination of
existence, of any Seller or ILTS shall not terminate the authority and agency
of the Sellers' Representative. Buyer, in dealing with the Sellers'
Representative, may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon
any act of the Sellers' Representative as the act of the Seller or ILTS.

  



  

(d) _Release from Liability; Indemnification_. Each Seller and ILTS
hereby releases the Sellers' Representative from, and each Seller and ILTS
agrees to indemnify the Sellers' Representative against, liability for any
action taken or not taken by the Sellers' Representative in his capacity as
such (including the expenses referred to in _Section 11.1(e)_ hereof), except
for the liability of the Sellers' Representative to a Seller or ILTS for loss
which such Seller or ILTS may suffer from the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Sellers' Representative in carrying out his duties
hereunder. The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable to any Seller or
ILTS or to any other Person with respect to any action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Sellers' Representative in his role as Sellers' Representative
under or in connection with this Agreement, unless such action or omission
results from or arises out of willful misconduct or gross negligence on the
part of the Sellers' Representative, and the Sellers' Representative shall
not be liable to any Seller or ILTS in the event that, in the exercise of his
or its reasonable judgment, the Sellers' Representative believes there will
not be adequate resources available to cover potential costs and expenses to
contest a claim made by Buyer against the Sellers or ILTS.

 | | 
---|---|--- 

    

(e) _Reimbursement of Expenses_. The Sellers' Representative shall
receive no compensation for service as such but shall receive
reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, the Sellers or ILTS, pro rata in
accordance with the number of shares of Common Stock held by each Seller or
ILTS as of the Closing Date, for any and all expenses, charges and
liabilities, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees,
incurred by the Sellers' Representative in the performance or discharge of his
duties pursuant to this _Section 11.1_.

  



  

(f) _ILTS_. The appointment of the Sellers' Representative as the
agent and attorney-in-fact for ILTS shall terminate at the Closing and
thereafter Sellers' Representative shall have no further right to act on
behalf of ILTS under this _Section 11.1_.

  



  

11.2 _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing,
neither the Company nor the Sellers or ILTS and the Sellers or ILTS shall not
permit Holdings or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company to, issue any press
release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement without the prior written approval of Buyer, and Buyer shall
not issue any press release or make any public announcement related to the
subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written consent of
Sellers' Representative; provided, however, that any Party may make any
public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable law or
any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in
which case the disclosing Party will use its reasonable best efforts to
advise the other Parties prior to making the disclosure).

  



  

11.3 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall not confer
any rights or remedies upon any Person other than (i) the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) as provided in _Section
9.6_ which is intended for the benefit of Buyer's former and current officers
and directors, (iii) after the Effective Time, the right of the stockholders
of Buyer to receive the merger consideration specified in _Section 2.3(b)_
and (iv) after the termination of this Agreement, the rights of stockholders
of Buyer to pursue claims for damages and equitable relief for the Sellers',
ILTS' or the Company's willful breach of any of their representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement.

  



  

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents
referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or
between the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to
the subject matter hereof.

  



  

11.5 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Prior to the Closing, (i) none
of the Sellers, ILTS, or the Company may assign this Agreement or any of
their rights, interests or obligations hereunder, without the prior written
approval of Buyer and (ii) Buyer may not assign this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the Company and the Sellers' Representative.

Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims,

Party notice in the manner herein set forth.

  



  

11.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

  



  

11.10 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement prior to the Closing shall be valid unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by Sellers' Representative, the Company and Buyer. No
amendment of any provision of this Agreement after the Closing shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Sellers' Representative and
Holdings. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the Party making such waiver nor shall such
waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in
any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant.

  



  

11.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

11.12 _Expenses_. Each Seller, ILTS, the Company and its Subsidiaries
and Holdings and Buyer will bear his, her, or its own costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this
Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing.

  



  

11.13 _Transfer Taxes_. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees
and charges (including any penalties and interest) imposed on the Company in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions shall be paid by the
Company when due, and the Company will, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes,
fees and charges, and, if required by applicable law, the Parties will, and
will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

  



   

-49-

 | | 
---|---|--- 

    

11.14 _Construction_. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or
non-U.S. statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
The word "including" shall mean including without limitation. Nothing in the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein unless the Disclosure Schedule
identifies the exception with reasonable particularity and describes the
relevant facts in reasonable detail. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other
item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation
or warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty has to do with
the existence of the document or other item itself). The Parties intend that
each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the
same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that
the Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that
the Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant.

  



  

11.15 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and
Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof.

  



  

11.16 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any provision of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
otherwise is breached, so that a Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in addition
to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled, at law or in equity.
In particular, the Parties acknowledge that the Business is unique and
recognize and affirm that in the event Sellers or the Company breach
this Agreement prior to the Closing, money damages would be inadequate and
Buyer would have no adequate remedy at law, so that Buyer shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to
enforce its rights and the other Parties' obligations hereunder not only by
action for damages but also by action for specific performance, injunctive,
and/or other equitable relief.

  



  

11.17 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties submits to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court. Each Party also agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives
any bond, surety, or other security that might be required of any other
Party with respect thereto.
