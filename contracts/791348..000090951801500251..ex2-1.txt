amount equal to Four Hundred Thirty Million Dollars
($430,000,000.00), (hereinafter, the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment
as provided in Section 3.2, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account of Seller designated in writing by Seller at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.   3.2 Purchase Price Adjustment.
(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 45 days after the
Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with an audited balance sheet of the
Business as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date prepared in
accordance with GAAP utilizing the same methodology and adjustments as were
used in preparing the Business Financial Statements, and a statement of
Working Capital (the "Statement of Working Capital") setting forth a true,
correct and complete listing of each of the components making up Working
Capital, as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date and setting
forth in reasonable detail, adjustments, if any, to the Working Capital set
forth in the Business Financial Statements. Buyer and its
independent auditors and other representatives shall have the right to review
and to verify the Statement of Working Capital when received. As used in this
Section, the term "Working Capital" consists of the following items relating
to the Business and the Purchased Assets: (i) Accounts Receivable net of
reserves; plus (ii) Inventory, plus (iii) Other Current Assets transferred to
Buyer; plus (iv) Construction in Progress; plus (v) Deferred Charges; minus
(vi) Accounts Payable; minus (vii) all other Current Liabilities assumed by
Buyer.   (b) Buyer shall have 30 days following receipt by it of
the Statement of Working Capital during which to dispute the Statement of
Working Capital in writing. If Buyer fails to notify Seller of any such
dispute within such 30-day period, the Statement of Working Capital shall be
the "Final Statement." If Buyer timely notifies Seller of any such dispute,
and Seller and Buyer cannot resolve any such dispute within 30 days of
receipt by Buyer of such notice, such dispute shall be resolved by a "big
five" accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the parties (the accounting
firm so engaged shall act as an expert and shall hereinafter be referred to
as the "Independent Accounting Firm"); the determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be made as promptly as practicable and shall be final
and binding on both Buyer and Seller. Any expenses relating to engagement of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.
In the event of a dispute, the Statement of    13  Working Capital, as
modified by resolution by Buyer and Seller, or by the Independent Accounting
Firm, shall be the "Final Statement."   (c) If the Working Capital, as set
forth in the Final Statement exceeds the Working Capital as reflected by the
May 31, 2001 Business Financial Statements of Seller, the Purchase Price
shall be increased by such excess, and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to such excess. If the Working Capital as set forth in the Final
Statement is less than the amount reflected by the May 31, 2001 Business
Financial Statements of Seller, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by such
deficit, and Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such deficit. The
Purchase Price as adjusted is hereafter referred to as the "Final Purchase
Price."   (d) Any payments to be made by Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be, pursuant to Section 3.2(c) shall be made by wire transfer in
immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after the date upon
which the Statement of Working Capital becomes the Final Statement (either
upon expiration of the 30-day period referred to in Subsection (b) above or
resolution of any dispute with respect to the Statement of Working Capital),
in an amount determined pursuant to Section 3.2(c), together with interest
thereon from the Closing Date through the date such payment is made at the
prime lending rate as announced as of the date of such payment by Citibank,
N.A.   3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. Prior to Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall mutually agree upon a preliminary allocation of the Purchase
Price among the Purchased Assets in a manner which shall comply with Section
1060 of the Code. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Purchased
Assets in accordance with the relative fair market value of the Purchased
Assets. No later than thirty (30) days after the date upon which the
Statement of Working Capital becomes the Final Statement, Seller and Buyer
shall mutually agree upon the final allocation of the Purchase Price (the
"Final Purchase Price Allocation") among the Purchased Assets to reflect any
adjustment in the Purchase Price provided for in Section 3.2(c). The Final
Purchase Price Allocation shall be made in the manner prescribed in the
second preceding sentence. The parties will each report the federal, state,
local and other Tax consequences of the purchase and sale contemplated hereby
(including of the filing of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in a manner
consistent with such allocation.    ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND

Transferred Employees. To the extent permitted under any applicable plan,
Buyer shall waive all pre-existing conditions, limitations or exclusions and
waiting periods for the Transferred Employees under all pension, profit

such proceeds, then Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the net amount of such
proceeds or, if less, the amount of such indemnity payment. Buyer shall (and

promptly recover insurance proceeds that may be due to Buyer or any such
Person. Buyer agrees that it will use commercially reasonable

directly or indirectly, such proceeds, then Seller shall promptly pay to
Buyer the net amount of such proceeds or, if less, the amount of such
indemnity payment. Seller shall (and shall cause any other Person entitled to
indemnity under Section 13.3(a)) to promptly recover insurance proceeds that
may be due to Seller or such Person.   13.4 Claims. As soon as is
reasonably practicable after becoming aware of the commencement of any claim,
suit, action or proceeding (each a "Claim") brought by a Third Party, with
respect to which indemnity may be claimed pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall promptly give notice to the
Indemnifying Person of such claim or the commencement of any such suit,
action or process, and a good faith estimate of the amount the Indemnified
Person will be entitled to receive hereunder from the Indemnifying Person;
provided, that the failure of the Indemnified Person to    43  give
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations
under this Article XIII except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying
Person shall have been actually prejudiced thereby. A Claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party claim may be
asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought without
the need to comply with Sections 13.5 through 13.7.   13.5 Assumption of
Defense. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense (a) participate in
the defense of any Claim, and (b) upon notice to the Indemnified Person and
the Indemnifying Person\'s delivering to the Indemnified Person a written
agreement that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 13.2 or 13.3 for all Losses arising out of such Claim, at any time
during the course of any such Claim, assume the defense thereof; provided,
that (i) the Indemnifying Person\'s counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall thereafter consult
with and update the Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified Person\'s
reasonable request for such consultation or update from time to time with
respect to such Claim. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense,
the Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute any such Claim, all of
the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof.   13.6 Settlement or Compromise. Any settlement or compromise made
or caused to be made by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person, as
the case may be, of any such Claim, shall also be binding upon the
Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the
same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise;
provided, that subject to Section 13.7 hereof no obligation, restriction or
Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person or the Business, as the case
may be, as a result of such settlement without the prior written consent of
such Indemnified Person. The Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person,
as the case may be, will give the other party hereto at least thirty (30)
days\' prior written notice of any proposed settlement or compromise of any
Claim it is defending, during which time such other party may reject such
proposed settlement or compromise; provided, that from and after such
rejection, such other party shall be obligated to assume the defense of, and
full and complete liability and responsibility for, such Claim, and any and
all Losses in connection therewith in excess of the amount of Losses which
the Indemnified Person would have been obligated to pay under the proposed
settlement or compromise.   13.7 Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act. In
the event that the Indemnifying Person does not elect to assume the defense
of any Claim, then (a) the Indemnified Party shall (upon further notice to
the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise
or settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party, subject to the Indemnifying Party\'s election to assume
the defense of such Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or
final determination thereof; and (b) any failure of the Indemnified Person to
defend or to participate in the defense of    44  any such Claim or to
cause the same to be done, shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations hereunder.   13.8 Exclusive Remedy/Limitations. Except as
provided in Section 14.8, or otherwise expressly provided by the Ancillary
Agreements, the rights and remedies set forth in this Article XIII shall,
from and after the Closing constitute the sole and exclusive rights and
remedies of (a) Seller Group against Buyer or Buyer Group and (b) Buyer Group
against Seller or Seller Group, in each case with respect to the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Obligations, the Business, this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements. The parties hereby waive, release and agree not to
assert any other right, whether arising by statute, common law, equity or
otherwise, including without limitation contribution or cost recovery claims
under Environmental Laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state laws, in connection
therewith or otherwise relating to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Obligations, the Business, this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. In no
event shall either party be liable for any punitive, exemplary or other non-
compensatory damages.    ARTICLE XIV  DISPUTE RESOLUTION   14.1 Mutual
Dispute Resolution. Any dispute or difference arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or the formation of this Agreement after Closing (other
than disputes arising under Section 3.2 but including, without limitation,
any contested claim for indemnification pursuant to Article XIII above),
shall be first submitted for resolution pursuant to the following procedure.
First, an executive officer of each party will meet to resolve the dispute.
If such executive officers were unable to resolve the dispute, the Chief
Executive Officers of each party or a designee will attempt to resolve
the dispute. If the Chief Executive Officers are unable to resolve the
dispute within 60 days following the original notice of such claim or
dispute, such dispute shall be submitted to mediation pursuant to the
remaining provisions of this Article XIV.   14.2 Mediation. If the parties
are unable to resolve, pursuant to Section 14.1, any dispute or differences
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, (including, without
limitation, any contested claim for indemnification pursuant to Article
XIII), the dispute or differences shall be submitted to non-binding mediation
in accordance with this Article XIV.   14.3 Mediator. Mediation of each
dispute shall be facilitated by a single licensed or certified mediator,
selected by the parties, knowledgeable and experienced in the matter and in
resolution of commercial disputes. If the parties are unable to reach
agreement on a single mediator, each of Buyer and Seller shall designate a
representative of its own choosing, and the two persons so designated shall
select a third mediator who shall mediate the dispute.   14.4 Specifics of
Mediation. The mediation shall take place in Minneapolis, Minnesota or in
such other place as the parties may agree, within sixty (60) days following
the date one or both of the Chief Executive Officers    45  conclude that
they are unable to resolve the matter pursuant to Section 14.1 (the
"Mediation Period").   14.5 Procedures. If the mediation is unsuccessful in
resolving the dispute or any person fails or refuses to participate in the
mediation, then at the expiration of the Mediation Period either party may
bring an action for relief in any court having jurisdiction thereof.   14.6
Confidentiality. All proceedings under this Article XIV, and all evidence
given or discovered pursuant hereto, shall be maintained in confidence by all
parties in accordance with Section 6.4.   14.7 Continued Performance. The
fact that the dispute resolution procedure specified in this Article XIV
shall have been or may be invoked shall not excuse any party from performing
its obligations under this Agreement, and during the pendency of any such
procedure all parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations
in good faith, subject to any rights to terminate this Agreement that may be
available to any party.   14.8 Equitable Relief. Nothing contained in this
Article XIV shall limit the right of any party to seek or obtain specific
performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary remedies in any court of
competent jurisdiction.    ARTICLE XV  MISCELLANEOUS   15.1 Disclosure
Schedules. The inclusion of any matter on any Schedule shall not constitute
an admission by Seller that such matter is material or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller may update any Schedules
referred to in this Agreement prior to or at the Closing by giving notice to
Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such updates will be
effective to cure and correct, for all purposes, any breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant which would have existed if
Seller had not made such update, so long as such update(s) individually or in
the aggregate do not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business. All
references to any Schedule which is updated pursuant to this Section 15.1
shall, for all purposes, be deemed to be a reference to such Schedule as
updated.   15.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party
hereto shall bear its own expenses with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby.   15.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented only by a writing signed by Buyer and Seller.  
15.4 Interpretation. The headings preceding the text of articles and sections
included in this Agreement and the headings to schedules and
exhibits attached to this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
deemed part of this Agreement or be given any effect in interpreting this
Agreement. The terms as set forth in this Agreement have been arrived at
after mutual negotiation and, therefore, it is the intention of the parties
that its terms    46  may not be construed against any of the parties by
reason of the fact that it was prepared by one of the parties.   15.5
Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by a party hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been given (a) when received if given in person or by courier or a
courier service, (b) on the date of transmission if sent by telex, facsimile

15.6 Waivers. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or
of any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one
or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such    47  condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any
other condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or
warranty.   15.7 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns; provided, however, that neither this
Agreement, nor any Ancillary Agreements nor any right or obligation hereunder
or thereunder may be assigned by any party hereto other than to an Affiliate
of such party without the prior written consent of the other parties;
provided further, that no such assignment shall relieve a party from its
obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; provided
further, that Buyer may make a collateral assignment of its rights under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to any lender who provides working
capital or other financing to the Buyer. Buyer may designate one or more
Affiliates to take title to certain of the Purchased Assets, but no such
designation shall relieve Buyer from any obligation under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement.   15.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in Article XIII, this Agreement is solely for
the benefit of the parties hereto and, to the extent provided herein, their
respective Affiliates, and no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
confer upon any other third parties any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, cause of action or other right, including without limitation,
rights in any Affected Employee in respect of any right to contract or any
right to employment or continued employment with Buyer.   15.9 Publicity.
Prior to the Closing Date, except as required by Law or the rules of any
stock exchange, no public announcement or other publicity regarding the
transactions referred to herein shall be made by Buyer or Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives
or agents, without the prior written agreement of Seller and Buyer,
respectively. Any announcement or disclosure required by Law or the rules of
any stock exchange shall be made only after consultation with the other
party as to the contents of any such announcement or disclosure. Any
announcement shall be agreed to by the parties as to form, content, timing
and manner of distribution or publication. Nothing in this Section 15.9 shall
prevent such parties from discussing such transactions with those Persons
whose Consent, approval, agreement or opinion, as the case may be, is
required for consummation of such transactions. Such parties shall exercise
all reasonable efforts to assure that such Persons keep confidential any
information relating to this Agreement or any agreement, document or
instrument contemplated herein.   15.10 Further Assurances/Cooperation.
Seller, Cargill and Buyer agree to cooperate fully with each other in
connection with obtaining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Articles VIII and IX. Seller, Cargill and Buyer agree to execute and deliver

Agreement and any agreement, document or instrument contemplated herein.
After the Closing, Buyer will cooperate with Seller in    48  providing

purpose of managing and resolving any matters arising from the
Excluded Obligations.   15.11 Transition Services. For a six month period
immediately following the Closing, Seller shall provide certain transition
services to Buyer to assist in the transition of the Business from Seller to
Buyer. Services will be provided on reasonable terms and conditions to be
negotiated by the parties prior to Closing and pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
D.   15.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby,

legal and enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at
issue.   15.13 Entire Understanding. This Agreement and the

parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and supersede any and all prior agreements, arrangements and
understandings among such parties relating to the subject matter hereof.

enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.   15.15

the courts of the State of Delaware or the United States of America for the
District of Delaware are to have jurisdiction to settle any claims,
differences or disputes which may arise out of or in connection with this
Agreement.   (b) Each party hereto irrevocably waives any objection it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any proceedings in
any court referred to in subsection (a) of this Section 15.15 and any claim
that any proceedings brought in any such court have been brought in an
inconvenient forum and further irrevocably agrees that a judgment in any
proceedings brought in a court of the State of Delaware or of the United
States of America for the District of Delaware shall be conclusive and
binding upon Buyer and may be enforced in the courts of any other
jurisdiction.   15.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in

SERVICES AGREEMENT    This Transition Services Agreement ("Agreement") is
dated as of ____________, 2001 by and between, Lone Star Technologies, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("LST"), Star Seamless, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Star," together with LST, the "Buyer"); Cargill, Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation ("Cargill"), North Star Steel Company, a Minnesota corporation
("North Star"), and Universal Tubular Services, Inc., a Texas corporation
("UTS") (Cargill, North Star and UTS being individually and collectively
referred to herein as "Seller").   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, pursuant to the
terms of a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of ________________, 2001, to
which Seller and Buyer are parties (the "Purchase and Sale Agreement"), Buyer
will, contemporaneously with the effectiveness of this Agreement, acquire the
Business (the "Acquisition"); and   WHEREAS, Buyer has requested that Seller
provide Buyer with those certain transition services described on Schedule A
(or the individual Addendums thereto) attached hereto and made a part hereof
(the "Transition Services", and each a "Transition Service"), for a period of
time after the Closing Date.   NOW, THEREFORE, and in consideration of the
premises and the mutual covenants herein contained and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:  1. DEFINITIONS.
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the
meanings given those terms in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  2.
TRANSITION SERVICES; LIMITATIONS.   A. Subject to the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, Seller shall provide to Buyer the Transition Services as
described on Schedule A or the Addendums thereto. Detailed costs and precise
services (including additional services as may be agreed to by the parties)
are reflected to the extent presently possible on Schedule A or the Addendums
thereto, or shall be negotiated in good faith subsequent to the Closing by
the Parties.   B. The provider of a Transition Service hereunder (Seller or
a particular Affiliate of Seller, as the case may be) shall be referred to
as "Service Provider" and the recipient of a Transition Service hereunder
(Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, as the case may be) shall be referred to as
"Service User". The Service Provider shall provide the Transition Services to
Buyer in good faith, in substantially the same manner, at substantially the
same quality, and with substantially the same degree of care the Service
Provider has provided such Transition Services to the Business during the
12-month period immediately    prior to the execution of the Purchase and
Sale Agreement. Service Provider shall have no obligation to supply
Transition Services hereunder (i) that are not of the type presently being
supplied by Seller to the Business and (ii) if a third party\'s consent is
necessary for Service Provider to provide such Transition Services and such
third party\'s consent has not been obtained after Service Provider has
notified Service User of the failure to obtain such consent within ten (10)
days prior to the Closing, and the reasons therefor, if known to Service
Provider, and shall have used best efforts (to the extent legally possible)
to obtain such consent.   C. In providing the Transition Services, Service
Provider, as deemed necessary or appropriate in its reasonable discretion,
may (i) use its own personnel, or (ii) employ the services of third parties
(at the market rates charged by such third parties, and without further
markup by Service Provider) to the extent such third party services are
routinely utilized to provide similar services to Service Provider\'s own
businesses or are reasonably necessary for the efficient performance of any
Transition Service. Prior to entering into any new agreement with any third
party service provider for the provision of Transition Services, Service
Provider shall give not less than ten (10) business days written notice to
Service User.   D. As needed from time to time during the term of this
Agreement, and upon termination of any Transition Service or this Agreement,
the Service Provider will provide Buyer all records, whether such are in
written electronic or other format, related to the provision of the
Transition Services hereunder in such format, whether written, electronic or
other, as may be reasonably requested by Buyer. Upon termination of this
Agreement, each party hereto shall, at the request of the other party,
promptly return to such requesting party or its designated representatives or
otherwise dispose of as the requesting party may instruct all materials that
contain confidential or proprietary information in written, recorded, or
other tangible form that such party may have in its possession, custody, or
under its direct or indirect control.   E. Buyer and Seller shall designate
a representative to act as their primary contact person with respect to the
provision of all Transition Services (each such person being a "Responsible
Person"). The initial Responsible Person for Buyer shall be _______________
and for Seller shall be Terry Forrest.  3. TERM OF AGREEMENT/TRANSITION
SERVICES. The obligation of Service Provider to provide each Transition
Service will commence on the Closing Date and, unless otherwise specified in
Schedule A or a particular Addendum thereto, will terminate on the "Service
Termination Date" for such Transition Service, which shall be the earliest to
occur of (i) the date specified on the applicable Addendum, which shall in no
event be a date later than six (6) months after the Closing Date, or (ii) the
date on which Service User, by notice to Service Provider at any time prior
to the termination of such Transition Service set forth on the applicable
addendum, terminates such Transition Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) either Buyer or Seller may, by giving written notice, terminate this
Agreement if the other party is in material breach of its obligations
hereunder and has failed to cure said breach within thirty (30) days after
receipt of written notice of such breach from the other party. Each   
2  Service User shall use reasonable commercial efforts to transition and
terminate the Transition Services as soon as possible after the Closing
Date.  4. COSTS. In consideration for the performance of each Transition
Service, Service User agrees to pay to Service Provider the amounts set forth
Schedule A or the Addendums thereto ("Costs"). Any Taxes (other than income
Taxes of Seller) assessed on the provision of Transition Services hereunder,
shall be paid by Service User.  5. INVOICE. Service Provider shall invoice
Service User monthly for Transition Services provided during the preceding
month and all invoices shall reflect in reasonable detail the nature and
quantity of the Transition Services rendered during the previous month and
the charges therefor. Service User agrees to pay to the invoicing entity each
invoice within thirty (30) days after Service User\'s receipt of each such
invoice.  6. COOPERATION. The parties will use good faith efforts to
cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the provision and
receipt of Transition Services. Each party will provide such facilities,
information, books, records, files, supplies, etc., as may be necessary or
desirable for Service Provider to provide the Transition Services and Service
User shall provide, from time to time, timely decisions on such matters as
required for the performance of the Transition Services by Service
Provider.  7. CONFIDENTIALITY. The parties each acknowledge and agree that
the confidentiality provisions of Section 6.4 of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement apply with respect hereto.  8. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND
REGULATIONS. Service User will use the Transition Services and Service
Provider shall perform or provide the Transition Services only in accordance
with all applicable Laws. Each party reserves the right to take all actions,
including termination of any particular Transition Service, upon not less
than twenty (20) days written notice to the other party, without penalty or
liability to the other party, that is reasonably believed, based upon the
advice of counsel, to be necessary to assure compliance with applicable
Laws or to avoid being subjected to regulation as a common carrier or
utility. No such termination or refusal to perform shall be deemed a breach
hereunder.  9. NO WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION.   A. SERVICE PROVIDER MAKES
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY OTHER MATTER WITH
RESPECT TO ANY TRANSITION SERVICE OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF.   B. Service
User shall indemnify and hold harmless Service Provider and its Affiliates
and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively,
"DOEAs") from and against any and all Losses incurred by Service Provider,
its Affiliates or their respective DOEAs as a result of the performance of
the Transition Services; provided, however, the foregoing    3  indemnity
shall not apply to any such Losses to the extent caused by acts or omissions
of Service Provider, its Affiliates or their respective DOEAs constituting
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The above indemnity includes, but is
not limited to, (a) any injury to or death of any persons or damage to or
loss or destruction of any property, (b) any contamination of or injury or
damage to or adverse effect upon persons, vegetation, air, land, water or the
environment, and (c) any governmental agency related claims,
losses, liabilities, damages and expenses.   C. Service Provider shall
indemnify and hold harmless Service User, its Affiliates and their respective
DOEA\'s from and against any and all Losses actually incurred by Service
User, its Affiliates or their respective DOEA\'s to the extent but only to
the extent arising out of any acts or omissions of Service Provider or its
Affiliates constituting willful misconduct. However, in no event shall
Service Provider be liable to Service User for special, consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages. Service Provider and its Affiliates shall have
no liability to Service User or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective DOEA\'s for any Losses arising out of this Agreement except as
expressly provided in the Section 9(c).   D. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, to the extent that Service Provider utilizes third
parties to provide Transition Services hereunder, Service Provider shall not
have any liability to Service User or their respective DOEAs for the acts and
omissions of such Third Party Suppliers; provided, however, if Service User,
any of its Affiliates or any of their respective DOEAs suffer Losses, due to
an act or omission of a Third Party Supplier which constitutes gross
negligence or willful misconduct, Service Provider will first present a claim
to the Third Party Supplier on behalf of Service User to the extent permitted
under Service Provider\'s agreement with the Third Party Supplier and will
pursue the claim in the same manner as Service Provider would pursue a claim
with respect to its other businesses and any recovery shall be remitted to
the affected indemnitee(s). Nothing contained herein shall require Service
Provider to institute any litigation or other proceeding against such Third
Party Supplier. Service Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Service User to be a third party beneficiary under any contracts with
third party service providers providing Transition Services.   E.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Service User hereby waives
for itself and its Affiliates any and all rights of recovery, claims, actions
or causes of action for any and all Losses to the extent it receives
insurance proceeds with respect thereto.   F. The provisions of this Section
9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  10. FORCE MAJEURE.
Service Provider shall not be liable for any failure to perform or delay in
performing its obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the extent its
failure to do so is caused by or results from any act of God; war, riot,
fire; explosion; accident; flood; sabotage, lack of (despite
reasonable efforts of such party to obtain) adequate fuel, power, raw
materials, labor, containers or transportation facilities; compliance with
Laws, national defense    4  requirements; or any other cause or
circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the affected party. The
Service Provider which is rendered unable to perform its obligations as a
result of the foregoing shall notify the Service User as soon as reasonably
possible to discuss the circumstances and potential solutions of such force
majeure event, including reasonable efforts as to mitigation of such force
majeure event and provision of substitute Transition Services by a Third
Party Supplier at Service User\'s sole cost and expense and the parties shall
reasonably cooperate in respect thereto.  11. THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS.   A.
Service User understands that the provision of some Transition Services may
involve services historically provided by a third party (a "Third Party
Supplier") to Service Provider or the lease or license of
property (including, without limitation, computer software) to Service
Provider by a Third Party Supplier. If permitted by the agreement governing
the provision of such services or property by a Third Party Supplier (a
"Third Party Agreement"), Service Provider will provide, or arrange for such
Third Party Supplier to provide, such Transition Service for Service User in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, if the
provision of such Transition Service would result in the breach of the terms
of such Third Party Agreement, then Service Provider shall be relieved of its
obligation to provide such Transition Service and shall instead use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to assist Service User in obtaining an
amendment to such Third Party Agreement or such other authorization from such
Third Party Supplier which would allow Service Provider to provide such
Transition Service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the
event that Service Provider is unable to obtain an amendment of such Third
Party Agreement or an authorization from such Third Party Supplier that would
allow Service Provider to provide such Transition Service to Service User,
Service Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Service User in obtaining a similar service (in both quality and quantity)
from another Third Party Supplier. Service User shall be solely responsible
for the cost of any such Third Party Supplier Transition Services.   B. At
its option and upon reasonable notice to Service User, Service Provider may
terminate or fail to renew any Third Party Agreement and contract with
another Third Party Supplier to provide the affected Transition Service
or, alternatively, perform such Transition Service itself.  12. AMENDMENT;
ADDITIONAL SERVICES. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented
only by a writing signed by the parties. The parties agree to amend this
Agreement to add additional services as Transition Services hereunder so long
as the parties agree such services would have been included as
Transition Services hereunder had the parties given consideration to such
services as of the date hereof.  13. NOTICES. Any notice, request,
instruction or other document to be given hereunder by a party hereto shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when received if
given in person or by courier or a courier service, (b) on the date of
transmission if sent by telex, facsimile or other wire    5  transmission
(receipt confirmed) or (c) five (5) Business Days after being deposited in
the mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid:   If to Seller,

individual or address as a party hereto may designate for itself by notice
given as herein provided.  14. WAIVERS. The failure of a party hereto at any
time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no
manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a
party of any condition or of any breach of any term, covenant, representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing,
and no waiver in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or
continuing waiver of any such condition or breach in other instances or a
waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term, covenant,
representation or warranty.    6  15. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, provided, however, that neither
this Agreement nor any right or obligation hereunder or thereunder may be
assigned by a party without the prior written consent of the other party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided further that
Buyer may assign this Agreement to its controlled affiliates. Buyer and
Seller shall remain responsible for the full and timely performance of this
Agreement by their respective Affiliates.  16. APPLICABLE LAW. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof.  17. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original,
but all of which together shall constitute one and the same original
instrument.  18. ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING. This Agreement sets forth the entire
agreement and understanding of Buyer and Seller with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede any and all prior
agreements, arrangements and understandings among such parties relating to
the subject matter hereof.  19. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement
is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and, to the extent provided
herein, their respective Affiliates, and no provision of this Agreement shall
be deemed to confer upon any other third parties any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.  20.
SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability
of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall
be deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and
enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at
issue.  21. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto recognize that if the
Service Provider fails or refuses to perform under this Agreement, monetary
damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Buyer for its injuries. The
Buyer shall, therefore, be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that
may be available, to obtain specific performance of this Agreement. If any
action is brought by the Buyer to enforce this Agreement, the Service
Provider shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law and
waive the requirement in respect of posting a bond.    7   IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by
their respective duly authorized representatives as of the day and year first
above written.   LONE STAR TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

EXHIBIT E  TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENT   THIS AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is
entered as of this ___ day of _________, 2001, by and between North Star
Steel Company, a Minnesota corporation ("Licensor"), Lone Star Technologies,
Inc. a Delaware corporation, ("LSS"), and Star Seamless, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("SSI") (LSS and SSI being referred to individually and
collectively hereinafter as "Licensee").   WHEREAS, Licensor is the owner of
the trade names and trademarks "NORTH STAR STEEL" and its corporate symbol
registered and used in the United States in connection with the Business and
shown on Attachment I hereto (such marks and derivations therefrom as
currently used by Licensor in connection with the Business are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the "Trademarks"); and   WHEREAS, Licensor and
Licensee have entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with respect to the
Business dated as of ___________, (which, together with the exhibits and
schedules thereto, is hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase and Sale
Agreement"); and   WHEREAS, Licensor utilizes the Trademarks in marking
its Inventory, Equipment and Fixed Assets and upon purchase orders, invoices,
and other business documents (such use of the Trademarks are referred to
herein as the "Current Use"); and   WHEREAS, the sale of the Business to
Licensee contemplates the licensing of the Trademarks within their Current
Use to Licensee on an interim basis to facilitate the transition of the
Business from Licensor to Licensee.   NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereby agree as follows:   1. Definitions.   Any capitalized
terms used but not defined in this Agreement, shall have the meaning given
those terms in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.   2. Grant of License.  
Subject to existing licenses, if any, in the Purchased Contracts, Licensor
hereby grants a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license (the
"License") to use the Trademarks within their Current Use in connection with
the Business, in the United States, for the term of this Agreement in order
to facilitate Licensee to sell, distribute and otherwise dispose of the
Inventory bearing the Trademarks and to utilize the Trademarks within their
Current Use.    1   3. Limitations on Use of the Trademarks.   3.1
Title to and ownership of the Trademarks is and shall always be vested solely
in Licensor. It is understood that the present license will not in any way
affect the ownership by Licensor of the Trademarks, which shall continue to
be the exclusive property of the Licensor and Licensee shall not represent
that it has any right, title or interest in the Trademarks other than the
rights expressly granted by this Agreement.   4. Covenants by Licensor.  
4.1 Licensor need not maintain the registrations, if any, of the Trademarks
if, in Licensor\'s sole discretion, Licensor determines not to do so.   4.2
Should it become necessary to record Licensee as a registered user of the
Trademarks in any country, Licensor shall prepare and file the appropriate
documents to effectuate such recording. Licensee shall cooperate in the
completion of such documentation. Expenses incurred by Licensor, or the
Licensee in the process of documentation and completion of said recording
shall be for the account of Licensee.   4.3 Licensor makes no representation
or warranty with respect to the Trademarks and the use thereof other than
those expressly set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.   5. Term and
Termination.   5.1 Unless such rights are otherwise terminated
in accordance with this Section 5, the Licensee\'s rights to use the
Trademarks under this Agreement shall terminate with respect to Inventory
upon the earlier of (i) the two year anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii)
the sale or other disposal of all Inventory, and shall terminate with respect
to other items bearing the Trademarks upon the earlier of (i) the ninth month
anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii), the sale disposal or remarking of
other items bearing the Trademarks. Licensee agrees to remove the Trademarks
from all Equipment and Fixed Assets and to utilize or replace other
consumable items which bear the Trademarks with items which do not bear the
Trademarks as expeditiously as reasonably possible after the Closing
Date.   5.2 In the event that the Licensee is, in Licensor\'s
sole judgment, in material breach of any provision of this Agreement, or in
the event, in Licensor\'s sole judgment, the use by the Licensee of the
Trademarks, does not comply in all material respects with the terms of this
Agreement, Licensee shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of written
notice from Licensor to fully cure, to Licensor\'s satisfaction, such breach,
failure or deficiency. If Licensee does not so cure, Licensor shall notify
Licensee in writing that the License has been terminated.   5.3 This
Agreement shall also be terminated in the following events: (i) dissolution
or liquidation of the Licensee; (ii) mutual written agreement of the parties
or (iii) Licensee makes an assignment for the    2  benefit of creditors,
experiences bankruptcy or any proceeding under the law pertaining to the
relief of debtors.   5.4 Upon the termination of this Agreement, Licensee
agrees that it will immediately cease using the Trademarks, make no further
shipments of Inventory bearing the Trademarks, destroy all unsold Inventory
bearing any of the Trademarks and have no further rights, interest or claims
to any of the Trademarks. Licensee shall thereafter not use any of the
Trademarks (or any trademarks confusingly similar to the Trademarks) for any
purpose whatsoever.   6. Assignment.   The Licensee shall not have any
right to assign this Agreement or to sublicense any of its rights hereunder
(other than to an Affiliate) without the express written consent of Licensor,
which consent may be withheld for any reason.   7. Infringement
Actions.   In the event that the Trademarks and/or the
Trademarks registration shall be infringed by any third party, Licensor shall
have the sole right to bring any action for infringement, at Licensor\'s cost
and expense, and to recover and retain any and all damages. The Licensee
shall give Licensor prompt notice of any such infringement that comes to its
attention and provide all cooperation and documentation requested by
Licensor.   8. Goodwill.   Licensee recognizes and acknowledges that the
Trademarks and all rights therein and goodwill pertaining thereto belong
exclusively to Licensor and Licensor\'s Affiliates, that the Trademarks have
a secondary meaning in the mind of the public, and that the use by Licensee
pursuant to this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Licensor and its
Affiliates.   9. Miscellaneous.   9.1 Notices. Any notice, request,
instruction or other document to be given hereunder by a party hereto shall
