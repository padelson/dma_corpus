dated as of April&nbsp;10, 2019 (this &#147;<U>Guarantee</U>&#148;), by MTY Food Group Inc., a corporation created under the Canada Business Corporations Act with its registered and head office at 8150 Autoroute Transcanadienne, Suite 200, Ville
Saint-Laurent, Quebec H4S 1M5, Canada (&#147;<U>Guarantor</U>&#148;), in favor of Papa Murphy&#146;s Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U>Guaranteed Party</U>&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1. <U>Guarantee</U>. To induce the Guaranteed Party to enter into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as
amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the &#147;<U>Merger Agreement</U>;&#148; capitalized terms used herein but not defined will have the meanings given thereto in the Merger Agreement), by and among
MTY Franchising USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), MTY Columbia Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;), and the Guaranteed Party, Guarantor hereby
irrevocably guarantees to the Guaranteed Party the due and punctual payment, observance, performance and discharge of all of the obligations, covenants and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, including, without
limitation, Article II and Section&nbsp;5.11 of the Merger Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement (as such obligations, covenants and agreements may be modified, amended or waived in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement, collectively, the &#147;<U>Obligations</U>&#148;); <U>provided that</U> in no event will Guarantor&#146;s liability under this Guarantee exceed an amount equal to the aggregate sum of the aggregate Merger Consideration, aggregate
amounts payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.3 of the Merger Agreement, the Payoff Amount, and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney&#146;s fees and expenses) incurred by the Company in connection with the enforcement of its rights
under Section&nbsp;8.15 of the Merger Agreement (such aggregate sum, the &#147;<U>Cap</U>&#148;), and the Guaranteed Party hereby agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Guarantee or the Merger Agreement, Guarantor
will in no event be required to pay the Guaranteed Party or any other Person pursuant to this Guarantee, more than the Cap, and that this Guarantee shall not be enforced against Guarantor for any other remedy, other than the payment of a sum of
money owing to Guarantor hereunder, in an amount not to exceed the Cap. It is acknowledged and agreed that this Guarantee will expire and will have no further force or effect, and the Guaranteed Party will have no rights hereunder, upon the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Guarantee, the Guaranteed Party hereby agrees that to the extent that Parent or Merger Sub is relieved from its payment obligations under the Merger Agreement by satisfaction thereof or
pursuant to any agreement with the Guaranteed Party, Guarantor will be similarly relieved, to such extent, of its obligations under this Guarantee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2. <U>Nature of Guarantee</U>. The Guaranteed Party will not be obligated to file any claim relating to any Obligation in the event that Parent
or Merger Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Guaranteed Party to so file will not affect Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Guaranteed Party in
respect of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor will remain liable hereunder with respect to the Obligations as if such payment had not been made. This is a guarantee of payment and not of
collectability. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

Party may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any Obligation, and may also make any agreement with Parent or Merger Sub for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise,
discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Guaranteed Party and Parent or Merger Sub without in any way impairing or affecting Guarantor&#146;s obligations under
this Guarantee. Guarantor agrees that the obligations of Guarantor hereunder will not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a)&nbsp;the failure or delay on the part of the Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub, (b)&nbsp;any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor, (c)&nbsp;any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub, (d)&nbsp;any amendment or modification of the Merger Agreement, or change in the manner, place or terms of payment or performance, or any change or extension of the time of payment or performance of,
renewal or alteration of, any Obligation, or any amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the terms of the Merger Agreement, (e)&nbsp;the adequacy of any other means the Guaranteed Party may have of obtaining repayment of any of
the Obligations, (f)&nbsp;the addition or substitution or release of any Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (g)&nbsp;the existence of any claim, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">set-off</FONT> or other right
that Guarantor may have at any time against the Guaranteed Party, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates, whether in connection with any Obligation or otherwise, (h)&nbsp;any right by statute or otherwise to require the Guaranteed Party
to institute suit against Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor/Parent Affiliate (as defined below) or to exhaust any rights and remedies which the Guaranteed Party has or may have against Parent, Merger Sub, or any of the Guarantor/Parent Affiliates
or (i)&nbsp;any other act or omission that may vary the risk of Guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Guarantor hereby irrevocably and expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any law which would otherwise
require any election of remedies by the Guaranteed Party. Guarantor hereby irrevocably and expressly waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Guarantee and of any Obligation, presentment, demand for payment, notice of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-performance,</FONT> default, dishonor and protest, notice of the incurrence of any Obligation and all other notices of any kind, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent or Merger Sub, and all
suretyship defenses generally (other than defenses to the payment of the Obligations under the Merger Agreement). Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. Guarantor agrees to pay on demand all reasonable
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by the Guaranteed Party in connection with the enforcement of its rights hereunder if
(x)&nbsp;Guarantor asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that this Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms and (y)&nbsp;the Guaranteed Party prevails in such litigation or proceeding. </P>
