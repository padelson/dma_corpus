(c) Examination and Review.

Company Member shall have 30 days (the "Review Period") to review the Closing
Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Company Member and
Company Members Accountants shall have full access to the books and records
of the Surviving Entity or any successor thereof, the personnel of, and work
papers prepared by, the Surviving Entity, Parent, their respective Affiliates
and/or their respective accountants to the extent that they relate to the
Closing Working Capital Statement and to such historical
financial information (to the extent in such persons or the Surviving
Entitys possession) relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement as
Company Member may reasonably request (at reasonable times) for the purpose of
reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of
Objections (defined below), _provided, that_ such access shall be in a manner
that does not interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or the
Surviving Entity.

 



16 (ii) _Objection._ On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Company
Member may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to
Parent a written statement setting forth objections of Company Member in
reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for
Company Members disagreement of therewith (the "Statement of Objections").
If Company Member fails to deliver the Statement of Objections before the
expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working
Capital Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Company Member. If
Company Member delivers the Statement of Objections before the expiration of
the Review Period, Parent and Company Member shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such objections within 30 days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within
the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working
Capital Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed in
writing by Parent and Company Member, shall be final and binding.

 

(iii) _Resolution of Disputes._ If Company Member and Parent fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period (any amounts remaining
in dispute, "Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the
"Undisputed Amounts"), then Parent and Company Member shall appoint by mutual
agreement the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants other than Company Members Accountants or
Parents Accountants (the "Independent Accountant") who, acting as experts
and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any
adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital
Statement. If Company Member and Parent are unable to so select the
Independent Accountants within twenty (20) days after the end of the
Resolution Period the American Arbitration Association shall make such
selection. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without
regard to materiality. The Independent Accountant shall only decide the
specific items under dispute by the parties and their decision for each
Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such item
in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections,
respectively.

(iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountant._ The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountant shall be paid by Company Member, on the one hand,
and by Parent, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the amount
actually contested but not awarded to Company Member or Parent, respectively,
bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by Company Member and
Parent.

(v) _Determination by Independent Accountant._ The Independent
Accountant shall make a determination as soon as practicable within 30 days
(or such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments
to the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

 



17 (vi) _Payments of Post-Closing Adjustment._ Except as otherwise provided
herein and subject to Section 2.05(d), any payment of the amounts set forth
in Section 2.05(b)(ii) in respect of the Post-Closing Adjustment, together
with interest calculated as set forth below, shall (A) be due (x) within
ten Business Days of acceptance of the applicable Closing Working Capital
Statement or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then within ten Business Days
of the resolution described in clause (v) above; and (B) be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account as is directed by
Parent or Company Member, as the case may be, or to the extent required by
Section 2.05(d) to be paid by the issuance of Parent common stock. The Post-
Closing Adjustment shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to
but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to five percent.
Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the
actual number of days elapsed.

 

(d) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or otherwise, if the value of the aggregate NCM Shares to be
received by the Company Member in Merger 1 would be less than forty percent
(40%) of the value of the aggregate consideration paid, payable or deemed to
be paid or payable to the Company Member (the "Aggregate Consideration")
under this Agreement, then the number of NCM Shares that the Company Member is
entitled to receive shall automatically be increased and the cash
consideration otherwise payable to the Company Member shall automatically
be decreased, such that, after such adjustment, the value of the NCM Shares
is equal to forty percent (40%) of the Aggregate Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, for
purposes of this Section 2.05(d) (including the last sentence of this Section
2.05(d)), the NCM Shares shall be valued at $15.15 per share. The intent of
this Section 2.05(d) is to ensure that the "continuity of
proprietary interest" requirement of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)
is met and shall be construed to effectuate such intent. In no event shall any
change in the composition of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Section 2.05(d) increase or reduce the aggregate amount of consideration
paid by Parent to the Company Member hereunder.

 

Section 2.06 Withholding Tax. Parent and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price all Taxes that Parent, the
Acquiror or the Company is required to deduct and withhold under any provision
of Tax Law; provided, that Parent provides advance notice to the Company
Member of any such requirements to deduct and withhold from any amounts paid
to the Company Member hereunder. To the extent Parent, the Acquiror or the
Company deducts and withholds any such Taxes with respect to any Person and
remits such Taxes to the applicable Governmental Authority, all such withheld
amounts shall be treated as having been delivered to or on behalf of such
Person hereunder.

 



18 Section 2.07 Stock Adjustment. Without limiting Section 5.08 and
subject thereto, if, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date, Parent is recapitalized or reclassified or Parent effects any
stock dividend, stock split, or reverse stock split or otherwise effects any
transaction that changes its common stock into any other securities, then the
NCM Shares to be delivered to Company Member under this Agreement will be
appropriately and equitably adjusted to the kind and amount of shares of stock
and other securities and property which the Company Member would have been
entitled to receive had the shares comprising the NCM Shares been issued and
outstanding as of the record date for determining stock holders entitled to
participate in such corporate event.

Section 5.09 Governmental Approvals and Consents; Defense of Lawsuits.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible (i) make, or cause or be
made, all filings and submissions (including those under the HSR Act)
required under any Law applicable to such party or any of its Affiliates; (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, promptly all
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals from all
Governmental Authorities (including under the HSR Act) that may be or become
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its
Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto shall not take
any action (including acquiring any business) that could reasonably be
expected to delay, impair or impede the receipt of any required consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals.

(b) Company Member and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to give all
notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are
described in Section 3.05 of the Disclosure Schedules.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the parties undertakings pursuant to
subsections (a) and (b) above, each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable best efforts prior to Closing to:

 

(i) respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority regarding antitrust
or other matters with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any agreement or document contemplated hereby;

(ii) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would

any agreement or document contemplated hereby; and

 



44 (iii) in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any agreement or document contemplated hereby has been issued, to have such
Governmental Order vacated or lifted.

 

(d) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between Company Member or the Surviving Entity with Governmental Authorities
in the ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by
Law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed
to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or
attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each
party shall give notice to the other party with respect to any meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff
or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being
sufficient to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

 

(e) Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend against
all lawsuits or other legal or regulatory proceedings challenging either of
the Mergers or their respective consummation, unless the parties mutually
consent to settlement of other resolution of the litigation or proceedings.
None of the parties shall commit to or agree (or permit their
respective Affiliates to commit to or agree) with any Governmental Entity to
stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, without
the prior written consent of the other parties (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.09 shall require,
or be construed to require, either party or any of its Affiliates, before or
after the Closing Date, to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, license,
discontinue or limit any of its or its Affiliates assets, businesses,
contracts or interests; (ii) any conditions relating to, changes in, or
restrictions on the operation of any of its or its Affiliates assets,
businesses, contracts or interests; (iii) any material modification or waiver
of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; or (iv) take any action
(or fail to take any action) which could adversely affect the Tax treatment
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as described in Section
2.02(f) and Section 6.05, except to the extent, in the case of
preceding clauses (i) and (ii), that such agreement could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



45 Section 5.10 Repayment of Indebtedness. Prior to or at the Closing, Company

of the deferred purchase price of property (excluding accounts payable in the

procedures with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and
estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the
Audited Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end.

Section 5.11 Roll-up of Company Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing, Company
Member shall have caused all of the Acquired Companies to have merged into,
combined with, the Company, liquidated with all assets distributed to the
Company, converted into single-member limited liabilities companies that
are treated as entities disregarded as separate from the Company for U.S.
federal income tax purposes or otherwise "rolled up" and combined so that upon
the Closing the Company, as a single entity, is treated as owning all of the
assets of the Company and the Acquired Companies for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (the "Company Roll-up").

 

Section 5.12 Books and Records.

be retained pursuant to the periods set forth in Article VI.

party with access to any books or records (including personnel files)
pursuant to this Section 5.12 to the extent such access would violate any Law.

party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as
are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof.

Section 5.14 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
requirements of the Nasdaq stock exchange (based upon the reasonable advice
of counsel), no party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise
communicate with any news media without the prior written consent of the
other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and
the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such
announcement _provided_ , that to the extent disclosure is so required by
applicable Law requirements of the Nasdaq stock exchange, the party intending
to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with the other parties in advance of such release with respect to the text
thereof.

procure the necessary funds.

 

Section 5.16 Post-Closing NCM Stock Matters. Within 30 days following the
Closing, Parent will file and cause to be effective a prospectus supplement
to its currently effective registration statement on Form S-3 (file no.
333-17055) or a substantially identical shelf registration statement to the
extent the existing shelf registration statement  

 



47  is no longer in effect (the "Shelf Registration Statement") to facilitate
the public resale of the NCM Shares by Company Member and/or the members of
Company Member to whom it distributes the NCM Shares in compliance with the
Securities Act. Parent shall keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective
and free of material misstatements or omissions (including the preparation and
filing of any amendments and supplements necessary for that purpose) until
the date on which Company Member and/or the members of the Company Member that
received the NCM Shares have transferred their respective NCM Shares to third

Section 5.17 EBITDA Price Adjustment. Promptly after the date hereof,
Company Member shall engage the Company Members Accountants to calculate the
EBITDA, on a consolidated basis, for the twelve month period ended April 30,
2014 (the "Adjusted EBITDA"). The Company Members Accountants shall then
deliver to the Company Member and Parent a statement setting forth the
Adjusted EBITDA and supporting details as to the calculation thereof (the
"EBITDA Statement"). The EBITDA Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles,
policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of
the Audited Financial Statements for the fiscal year 2013 as if such EBITDA
Statement was being prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end. The Adjusted
EBITDA so calculated by the Company Members Accountants shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto. Parent and Company Member shall each pay
one-half of the expenses of the Company Members Accountants to perform this
calculation.

 

Section 5.18 Employees. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Entity or its Affiliates to provide the employees of the
Surviving Entity and the Acquired Companies, as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date ("Business Employees"), with compensation and benefits that are,
in the aggregate, no less favorable than provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its subsidiaries. Parent further agrees that, from and
after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity and
its Affiliates to grant all Business Employees credit for any service with the
Company or any Acquired Company prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility
and vesting purposes, and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance benefit determinations under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that may be established or maintained by
Parent, Surviving Entity or any of their respective Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date (the "Acquiror Plans"), determined in a manner so as not to
create any duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent shall or shall cause
the Surviving Entity or its Affiliates to (A) cause to be waived all pre-
existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Acquiror Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a
Business Employee under the comparable  

 



48  Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and (B) cause any covered expenses
incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Business Employee (or covered
dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after
the Closing Date under any applicable Acquiror Plan. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Business Employee or any
other Person any right to continued employment or service relationship for any
period. The provisions of this Section 5.18 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including, without limitation, any Business Employee), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided
for in this Section 5.18 under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement
or otherwise. The provisions of this Agreement do not constitute an amendment
to any Benefit Plan.

Section 5.19 Representation and Warranty Insurance. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to find a representations and warranties insurance
policy as soon as practicable following the date hereof to protect Parent from
losses incurred as a result of the breach of any of the representations and
warranties of Company Member in Article III with coverage of $28.5 million
and retention no greater than $6,000,000, on terms reasonably acceptable to
the parties (the "RandW Insurance"). Company Member and Company shall provide
any and all information reasonably requested by the insurance underwriters
selected by Parent necessary to underwrite the RandW Insurance. Parent shall
purchase the RandW Insurance at Closing. Parent and Company Member will each pay
one-half of the premium of the RandW Insurance policy.

that may be suffered based upon, resulting from or arising out of the
circumstances giving rise to such termination, and upon payment of the Initial
Termination Fee and Subsequent Termination Fee in accordance with
this Section 8.03 none of the Company Member or any of Company Members
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this.

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. If Parent fails promptly to pay the Reverse Termination Fee or the
Company Member fails to pay the Initial Termination Fee or Subsequent
Termination Fee, as the case may be, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company Member or Parent, as the case may be, commences an action or
proceeding that results in a judgment against the other party for payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee, the Initial Termination Fee or the Subsequent
Termination Fee, as applicable, the Party responsible for the payment of any
such fee shall pay to the other party, together with the Reverse Termination
Fee, the Initial Termination Fee or the Subsequent Termination Fee, as
applicable (a) interest on the Reverse Termination Fee, the Initial
Termination Fee or the Subsequent Termination Fee, as applicable, from the
date of termination of this Agreement, or in the case of the payment of a
Subsequent Termination Fee, the date of such payment of the fee would have
otherwise been due and payable, at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the
Termination Date or the date a Subsequent Termination Fee would have been
otherwise due and payable, and (b) any and all reasonable legal fees incurred
by the Company Member or Parent, as the case may be, in connection with
any such action or proceeding.

the words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; (c) the
words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole; and (d) the phrases "in the ordinary course" or "in the
ordinary course of business" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase
"taking into account the impact that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have or would have on such Persons business". Unless the context
otherwise requires, references herein: (x) to Articles, Sections, Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement,
instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or other
document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent
permitted by the provisions thereof and (z) to a statute means such statute as
amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto and
any regulations promulgated thereunder. This Agreement shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred to
herein shall be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to
the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. All representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be qualified by
the Remedies Exception insofar as such representations and warranties relate
to a Contract or license being legal, valid, binding or enforceable.

 

Section 9.04 Headings. The table of contents and headings in this Agreement
are for reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this
Agreement.

Section 9.05 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
any other jurisdiction. Except as provided in Section 5.07(b), upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this

 



58  Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

Section 9.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the schedules
hereto, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes
all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, both written and
oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement, the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in
the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement will
control.

Section 9.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided,
however_ , after the Merger 2 Effective Time, Parent may, without the prior
written consent of Company Member, assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to one or more of its subsidiaries that are consolidated
for financial statement purposes so long as any such assignment satisfies the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k). No assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 9.08 No Third-party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the members of Company Member shall be express
third party beneficiaries of the rights set forth in Section 5.16.

 

Section 9.09 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by a duly
authorized officer of each party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the
provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing
and signed by the party so waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or
be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not
expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different
character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to
exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege
arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

 



59 Section 9.10 Specific Performance. Subject to Section 8.03 and this Section
9.10 each of Parent and Company Member hereto acknowledges and agrees that the
parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
is otherwise breached, so that, in addition to any other remedy that a party
hereto may have under law or equity, each Parent and Company Member shall be
entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof, including the Closing. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that (a) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief, and only to the extent provided in
this Section 9.10 to prevent breaches of this Agreement and enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement and (b) the right of specific performance and enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, none of the parties hereto would have entered into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01 then the parties hereto agree that the sole and
exclusive remedy in connection with the failure to consummate the Closing
shall be the right to terminate this Agreement and receive the Reverse
Termination Fee, the Initial Termination Fee and the Subsequent Termination
Fee, as applicable, pursuant to Section 8.03 and in the specified amounts.
Subject to Section 8.03, each of the parties hereto agree that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate
remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party hereto seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 9.11 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes
between the parties under or related to this Agreement or the facts and
circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction).

 

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE
FEDERAL COURTS

 



60  OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN
EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE CITY OF WILMINGTON AND COUNTY OF NEW CASTLE, AND EACH
PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER
DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE
SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY
SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO
THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN
AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11(C).

 

Section 9.12 Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement and the covenants hereunder which
by their terms are to be complied with, or performed, prior to the Closing
shall expire upon the Closing and not survive thereafter.

 

Section 9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement, it being understood that all the
parties need not sign the same counterpart. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.
