contracted), and each Suspense Share remitted to the Company prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of repayment of the ESOP Loan as contemplated by
_Section 5.17_, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

Plan, the Allegheny Valley Bancorp, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan and the
Standard Financial Corp. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the
"Company Stock Plan") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Option"), whether vested or unvested,
shall, automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from
Parent (or the Company, as directed by Parent) an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, _multiplied by_ the excess of
the Merger Consideration over  the exercise price per share of such Company
Stock Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be withheld from such
cash payment any applicable taxes required to be withheld by applicable law
with respect to such payment.

  



  

(d) At the Effective Time, any vesting restrictions on each outstanding
restricted stock award (a "Company RSA") under the Company Stock Plan shall
automatically lapse and such Company RSAs shall be treated as fully vested,
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the purposes of
this Agreement, including but not limited to, the provisions of _Section
2.5(a)_. The Company shall withhold any applicable taxes required to be
withheld by applicable law as a result of this _Section 2.5(d)_

2.6 Payment Procedures.

  



  

(a) Appropriate transmittal materials ("Letter of Transmittal") in a form
satisfactory to Parent and the Company shall be mailed as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
thereafter, to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time. A Letter of Transmittal will be deemed properly completed only
if, in the case of holders of certificated shares of Company

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

Common Stock, the completed Letter of Transmittal is accompanied by one or
more stock certificates representing, prior to the Effective Time, Company
Common Stock relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
(referred to collectively as "Certificate(s)") (or customary affidavits and,
if required by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.6(h)_, indemnification
regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed
delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of Company Common Stock
to be converted thereby. The Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall
include applicable provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's
message" or other appropriate instructions with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock that are book-entry shares.

  



  

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate and book-entry share
shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (it being
understood that any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed to also
include reference to book-entry ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)
and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto or any dividends or
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that were
declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time
and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with a bank, trust company, transfer agent and registrar or other similar
entity selected by Parent and consented to by the Company, whose consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld, which shall act as paying agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this _Section 2.6_, an amount of cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, (ii) be in a form and
contain any other provisions as Parent may reasonably determine and (iii)
include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefore a check in the amount equal to the
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5_.
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as
practicable following receipt of the properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, the Paying Agent
shall distribute the Merger Consideration as provided herein. If there is a
transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration shall be issued
to the transferee thereof if the Certificates representing such Company Common
Stock are presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Paying Agent, to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

  



  

(e) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of
Company Common Stock. If,

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this _Section 2.6_.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.5_ or any proceeds from any investments thereof that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be repaid by the Paying Agent to Parent upon the written
request of Parent. After such request is made, any stockholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.6_ shall look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to
_Section 2.5_ of this Agreement, without any interest thereon. If
outstanding Certificates are not surrendered prior to the date on which such
payments would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the
extent permitted by any abandoned property, escheat or other applicable laws,
become the property of Parent (and, to the extent not in its possession,
shall be paid over to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Paying Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any affiliate
thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(g) Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
Company's stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Certificate, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to
any claims thereto.

  



  

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Paying
Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.5_.

  



  

(i) The Paying Agent or Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the IRC, or any applicable provision of
U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such
amounts are properly withheld by the Paying Agent or Parent, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made by the Paying Agent or Parent.

Merger"), with Parent surviving the Second Step Merger and continuing its
corporate existence under its Charter, Bylaws and the laws of the United
States and its name and separate corporate existence, with all of its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger or the Second Step Merger, and the separate corporate existence of
the Surviving Corporation ceasing as of the Second Effective Time. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall cause to be filed with the SDAT,
in accordance with the MGCL, articles of merger (the "Second Articles of
Merger") relating to the Second Step Merger. The Second Step Merger shall
become effective as of the date and time specified in the Second Articles of
Merger (such date and time, the "Second Effective Time"). At and after the
Second Effective Time, the Second Step Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the MGCL.

purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such revised
structure shall not (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration or (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that Parent elects
to make such a revision, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents
to reflect the revised structure.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

2.13 Absence of Control. It is the intent of the parties hereto that
Parent and Merger Sub by reason of this Agreement shall not be deemed (until
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to control, directly or
indirectly, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to exercise, directly
or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

2.14 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall consider or be advised that any
further deeds, documents, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts
are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in Parent or any of its Subsidiaries its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes

ARTICLE III 
 Representations and Warranties

  



  

3.1 Disclosure Letters; Standard.

  



  

(a) Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company have each delivered to the other a letter (each, its
"Disclosure Letter") setting forth, among other things, facts, circumstances
and events the disclosure of which is required or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more of their respective representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.2 or Section 3.3, as applicable, or to one
or more of its covenants contained in Articles IV or V (and making specific
reference to the Section of this Agreement to which they relate). Disclosure
in any paragraph of the Disclosure Letter shall apply only to the indicated
Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably clear on
the face of such disclosure that it is relevant to another paragraph of the
Disclosure Letter or another Section of this Agreement.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

(b) No representation or warranty of the Company or Parent contained in
_Sections 3.2_ or _3.3_ , as applicable (other than (i) the representations
and warranties contained in _Sections 3.2(c)_ , _3.2(j)(i)_ and _3.3(g)_ ,
which shall be true in all respects, and (ii) the representations and
warranties contained in _Sections 3.2(a)_ , _3.2(b)_ , _3.2(d)_ , 
_3.2(e)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , _3.2(u)_ , _3.2(x)_ , _3.3(a)(i)_ , _3.3(b)_ ,
_3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)(i)_ and  _(ii)_ , which shall be true in all material
respects) will be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no party will be deemed to
have breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence
of any fact, event or circumstance, unless such fact, event or circumstance,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances
inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in _Sections 3.2_
or _3.3_ , has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may be (it being
understood that, except with respect to _Section 3.2(j)_ and  _3.3(g)_ , for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties,
all "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other materiality
qualifications contained in such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded).

  



  

3.2 Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company
represents and warrants to Parent that, except as disclosed in the Company's
Disclosure Letter:

  



  

(a) _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Maryland. The Company is on the date of this Agreement registered
with the FRB as a bank holding company. As of the Closing, the Company will
be registered with the FRB as a savings and loan holding company to the extent
required by the FRB to obtain the Charter Conversion Approvals or Section 10(
_l_ ) Approvals, as applicable, and to permit the Merger and the Second Step
Merger to be effected and Parent to hold Standard Bank as its wholly owned
subsidiary. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the business currently
being conducted by it. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it
or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
On the date of this Agreement the Company engages only in activities (and
holds properties only of the types) permitted for bank holding companies
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the rules
and regulations of the FRB promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(b) _Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(i) _Section 3.2(b) of the Company's Disclosure Letter_ sets
forth with respect to each of the Company's direct and indirect
Subsidiaries its name, its jurisdiction of incorporation, the Company's
percentage ownership, the number of shares of stock or other equity interests
owned or controlled by the Company and the name and number of shares held by
any other person who owns any stock of the Subsidiary. The Company owns of
record and beneficially all the capital stock of each of its Subsidiaries free
and clear of any Liens. There are no contracts, commitments, agreements or
understandings relating to the Company's right to vote or dispose of any
equity securities of its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement the

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

Company's ownership interest in each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to equity investments
by bank holding companies.

  



  

(ii) Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited
liability company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, has all requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the business
currently being conducted by it and is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(iii) The outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary
have been validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. No shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company
are or may be required to be issued by virtue of any options, warrants or
other rights, no securities exist that are convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of such capital stock or any other debt or equity security of any
Subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, agreements or
understandings of any kind for the issuance of additional shares of capital
stock or other debt or equity security of any Subsidiary or options, warrants
or other rights with respect to such securities.

  



  

(iv) Standard Bank is a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank. No
Subsidiary of the Company other than Standard Bank is an "insured
depository institution" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as
amended, and the applicable regulations thereunder. Standard Bank's deposits
are insured by the FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by law, and, since
January 1, 2017, Standard Bank has paid all premiums and assessments and
filed all reports required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the PDBS.
Standard Bank is a member in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Pittsburgh and owns the requisite amount of stock therein. Standard Bank's
asset composition would allow it to qualify as a Qualified Thrift Lender.

  



  

(c) _Capital Structure_.

  



  

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
40,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and
10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are (i) 4,679,849 shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding, including (A) 11,150 shares of Company RSAs and

rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No
trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of

  



  

   

15

forth in _Section 3.2(c) of the Company's Disclosure Letter_, there are no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements
obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any such securities. Except to the
extent disclosed pursuant to _Section 3.2(r) of the Company's Disclosure
Letter_ with respect to the ESOP, the Company and its Subsidiaries are not a
party to any voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of the Company
Common Stock or other equity interests of the Company.

Letter_ are: (a) a complete and accurate list of all outstanding Company
Stock Options, including the names of the optionees, dates of grant, exercise
prices, dates of vesting, dates of termination, shares subject to each grant,

appreciation, limited or other similar rights were granted in connection with
such options; and (b) a complete and accurate list of all outstanding shares
of Company RSAs, including the names of the grantees, dates of grant, dates of
vesting and shares subject to each grant.

  



  

(d) _Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder, subject to the consents, approval and filings set forth in
_Section 3.2(f)_, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate actions on the part of the Company's board of
directors, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than the approval and adoption of this
Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Company's board of directors
has determined that this Agreement is advisable and has directed that this
Agreement be submitted to the Company's stockholders for approval and adoption
and has unanimously adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect and
recommend that the stockholders adopt this Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally
and to general principles of equity, whether applied in a court of law or a
court of equity.

  



  

(e) _No Violations_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.2(e) of the
Company's Disclosure Letter, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) assuming that the consents,
approvals and filings referred to in _Section 3.2(f)_ have been obtained and
the applicable waiting periods have expired, violate any law, rule or
regulation or any judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or license to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective
properties) is subject, (ii) violate the articles of incorporation or bylaws
of the Company or the similar organizational documents of any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default

under (or an event which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default under), or result in the termination of, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, indenture, deed of
trust, loan agreement or other agreement, instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or to which any of their
respective properties or assets may be subject.

election under section 10( _l_ ) of HOLA to be deemed a savings association
and/or the Company being deemed a savings and loan holding company under

permit the Merger and Second Step Merger to be effected and Parent to hold
Standard Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary), (iii) the filing of the Articles
of Merger with the SDAT pursuant to the MGCL, (iv) the approval by the
Company's stockholders required to approve the Merger under the MGCL, and (v)
as disclosed in Section 3.2(f) of the Company's Disclosure Letter, no

Entity or any third party are required to be made or obtained in connection
with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the
consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has no Knowledge of any reason
pertaining to the Company or Standard Bank why any of the approvals referred
to in this _Section 3.2(f)_ should not be obtained without the imposition of
any material condition or restriction described in _Section 6.2(e)_.

  



  

(g) _Governmental Filings_.

  



  

(i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all
reports, schedules, registration statements and other documents,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
they were required to file since January 1, 2017 with the FDIC, FRB, PDBS or
any other Governmental Entity (collectively, the "Company's Reports"). No
administrative actions have been taken or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened or orders issued in connection with any of the Company's Reports.
As of their respective dates, each of the Company's Reports complied in all
material respects with all laws or regulations under which it was filed (or
was amended so as to be in compliance promptly following discovery of such
noncompliance). Any financial statement contained in any of the Company's
Reports fairly presented in all material respects the financial position of
the Company on a consolidated basis, the Company alone or each of the
Company's Subsidiaries alone, as the case may be (subject, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, to year-end audit adjustments as permitted by
GAAP and immaterial in nature and amount), and was

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP or applicable
regulations (except as may be expressly disclosed in the financial statements
or notes thereto).

  



  

(ii) The Company has filed (or furnished, as applicable) to the SEC
all registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules and
definitive proxy statements and exhibits thereto that it has been required to
file (or furnish, as applicable) with the Company since January 1, 2017 (the
"SEC Reports") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act")
or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). No
such SEC Report, as of the date thereof (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed (or furnished, as applicable) as of a later date (but before
the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an
earlier date. As of their respective dates, all SEC Reports filed (or
furnished, as applicable) under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto. No executive officer of the Company has

for the period ended June 30, 2020 filed with the SEC (collectively, the
"Company Financial Statements"). The Company Financial Statements (including
the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results
of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated

fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the
case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal and
immaterial in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates
of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP

indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. has not resigned (or informed the Company
that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants
of the Company as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with
the Company on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

(ii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic
process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse impact on the system of internal
accounting controls described below in this _Section 3.2(h)(ii)_. The
Company  has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known
to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company
by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of
the Company's board of directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures, if any, were made in writing by management to
the Company's auditor and audit committee and a copy of any such disclosure
has been made available to Parent. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is
no reason to believe that the Company's chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

conducts its business in compliance with all statutes, laws, regulations,

(x) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.2(r) of the Company's
Disclosure Letter_ or as required by this Agreement, neither the execution

Service that the ESOP meets the applicable qualification requirements of
Section 401(a) of IRC and, to the Knowledge of the Company, since the date of
such determination (i) such qualified status has not been revoked and (ii)
nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause revocation of
such qualified status or inability to rely on such determination. The shares
of Company Common Stock held by the Trust constitute "employer securities" as
defined in Section 409(l) of the IRC and "qualifying employer securities" as
defined in Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA. Other than the outstanding
indebtedness (as of the Closing Date) owed to the Company by the ESOP pursuant
to the Term Loan Agreement, dated as of October 6, 2010, by and between
Company and the Trust (the "ESOP Loan") and outstanding invoices from service
providers, there is no existing indebtedness of the ESOP. The ESOP Loan was
initiated, documented, repaid, and administered in accordance with its terms,
all applicable laws and the terms of the ESOP. Neither the transactions
contemplated hereby nor any conduct described in this Agreement with respect
to the ESOP violates any applicable law, including ERISA and the IRC, nor
could reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a breach of fiduciary duty
or non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the IRC, or result in the
imposition of any excise tax under the IRC.

any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, induce or encourage, or take
any other action to facilitate, any inquiries, offers, discussions or the

material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such

_Section 5.3_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or

or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such consent or approval will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such required consent or approval will be materially delayed.

  



  

5.5 Anti-takeover Provisions. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
take all steps required by any relevant federal or state law or regulation or
under any relevant agreement or other document to exempt or continue to exempt
Parent, the Agreement and the Merger from any provisions of an anti-takeover
nature in the Company's or its Subsidiaries' articles of incorporation and
bylaws, or similar organizational documents, and the provisions of any federal
or state anti-takeover laws.

  



  

5.6 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions and to do
promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or

make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
expeditiously as possible, including using efforts to obtain all necessary

shall be a joint press release mutually agreed to by the Company and the
Parent. Thereafter, the Company and the Parent agree that no public release
or announcement or statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by either party without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 5.7 _shall be deemed to prohibit any party from making any
disclosure which its counsel deems necessary in order to satisfy such party's
disclosure obligations imposed by law.

  



  

5.8 Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

(a) The Company will submit to its stockholders this Agreement and any
other matters required to be approved or adopted by stockholders in order to
carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation,
the Company will take, in accordance with applicable law and its articles of
incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to call and give notice of a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as
practicable to consider and vote on approval of this Agreement and the
transactions provided for in this Agreement. Subject to _Section 5.8(b)_, the
Company shall, (i) through the Company's board of directors, recommend to its
stockholders approval of this Agreement (the "Recommendation"), (ii) include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from its stockholders a vote approving and
adopting this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Stockholder Meeting, the Company's board of directors may,
if it concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
advisors) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, withdraw, modify or
change its recommendation that the stockholders of the Company approve this
Agreement in a manner adverse to Parent (a "Change of
Recommendation"); provided that prior to any such Change of Recommendation,
the Company shall have complied in all material respects with Section
5.1, given Parent written notice promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) advising it of the decision of the Company's board of
directors to take such action and, in the event the decision relates to an
Acquisition Proposal, given Parent the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the person making any such
Superior Proposal and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event the decision relates to
an Acquisition Proposal: (i) the Company shall have given Parent three (3)
Business Days after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and if Parent proposes to revise
the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall have negotiated, and shall
have caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, in good faith with
Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal; and (ii) the
Company's board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after
considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any
proposals,

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

amendments or modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event the
Company's board of directors does not make the determination referred to in
clause (ii) of this paragraph and thereafter determines to withdraw, modify
or change its recommendation that the stockholders of the Company approve this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.8(b)_ in connection with a new
Acquisition Proposal, the procedures referred to above shall apply anew and
shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change, except
that the three (3) Business Day period referred to above shall be reduced to
two (2) Business Days. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall
not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other
than the Merger. The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Stockholder
Meeting for at least fifteen (15) calendar days if, as of the time for which
such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such
meeting the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares necessary to approve the Merger, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit proxies from its stockholders in order to obtain
the votes required to approve the Merger; provided that the Company shall not
be required to adjourn or postpone the Stockholder Meeting more than one time
for the reasons set forth in this sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, but subject to the obligation to adjourn or postpone such
meeting as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Stockholder
Meeting shall be convened by the Company and this Agreement shall be submitted
to the Company's Stockholders.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying
of the Company Recommendation or the making of a Change of Recommendation by
the Company's board of directors shall not change the approval of the
Company's board of directors for purposes of causing any applicable
"moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "takeover,"  "interested
shareholder" or similar law to be inapplicable to this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in _Section 5.8_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company's board of directors from complying with the Company's
obligations required under Rules 14d-9 (as if such rule were applicable to the
Company) and 14e-2(a) (as if such rule were applicable to the Company)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a change in the
Company's Recommendation unless it is limited to a stop, look and listen
communication or the Company's board of directors reaffirms the Company's
Recommendation in such disclosure.

  



  

5.9 Proxy Statement.

  



  

(a) The Company shall prepare a proxy statement and related materials
relating to the matters to be submitted to the Company stockholders at the
Stockholder Meeting (such proxy statement and related materials and any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement"). Upon request,
Parent will furnish to the Company the information required to be included in
the Proxy Statement with respect to Parent's and its

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

business and affairs and shall have the right to review and consult with the
Company and approve the form of, and any characterizations of such information
included in, the Proxy Statement prior to its being filed on a preliminary
basis with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity for review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to
its filing with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent
or the Company, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by law,
rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

  



  

(b) _Company Information_. The Proxy Statement will, when filed, comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act. The information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
included in the Proxy Statement, and all amendments and supplements thereto,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, provided that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to information supplied by Parent or any affiliate or
representative of Parent specifically for use or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement. The information supplied, or to be supplied, by the
Company for inclusion in applications to Governmental Entities to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be accurate
in all material respects.

  



  

(c) _Parent Information_. The information regarding Parent to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

  



  

5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt
notice to the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other communication
relating to, a default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default, received by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent
to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any
contract material to the financial condition, properties, businesses or
results of operations of each party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to
which each party or any Subsidiary is a party or is subject; and (ii) any
event, condition, change or occurrence that individually or in the aggregate
has, or which, so far as reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its
occurrence, is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To
the extent permitted by law, the Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any new civil, criminal, administrative or regulatory action, suit, demand
letter, demands for indemnification, claim, hearing, notice of violation,
arbitration, investigation, order to show cause, market conduct examination,
notice of non-compliance or other proceeding of any nature pending or
threatened against the Company or any of its

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

Subsidiaries. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand, shall give prompt notice to the other of any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third
party is or may be required in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

5.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

  



  

(a) Parent shall endeavor to retain as many of Company's and Standard
Bank's employees ("Covered Employees") as it deems reasonably practical to
operate Standard Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement is not
intended to provide any Covered Employee a legally enforceable right to
continuing employment, or any particular terms and conditions of employment,
after the Effective Time, and any Covered Employees that continue employment
after the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") shall become
employees at will of Parent or continue as an at-will employee of Standard
Bank.

  



  

(b) Following the Effective Time and for at least twelve (12) months
thereafter, Parent shall maintain or cause to be maintained, except
with respect to employees that will enter into Cancellation Agreements as
provided in Section 5.11(e) of this Agreement, base salaries, health and
welfare benefits, retirement benefits and incentive compensation (specifically
excluding equity or equity-based plans, defined benefit pension plans, and
the ESOP) opportunities for the benefit of Continuing Employees that, in the
aggregate are; (i) substantially comparable to the base salaries, health and
welfare benefits, retirement benefits and incentive
compensation opportunities (specifically excluding equity or equity-based
plans, defined benefit pension plans, and the ESOP) that are generally made
available under the applicable Company Employee Plans, or, at Parent's sole
election, (ii) substantially comparable to the base salaries, health and
welfare benefits, retirement benefits and incentive compensation opportunities
provided by Parent or Dollar Bank to similarly situated employees of Parent
or Dollar Bank.

  



  

(c) Parent agrees that any Continuing Employee who is involuntarily
terminated by Parent, Standard Bank or Dollar Bank (other than for cause as
determined by Parent), upon executing an appropriate general release of claims
in a form reasonably determined by Parent, will receive severance payments
and benefits in accordance with _Section 5.11(c) of the Company's Disclosure
Letter_.

  



  

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent, Standard Bank
or Dollar Bank in which any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate or continues to participate on or after the Effective Time (the
"New Plans"), to the extent necessary, Parent agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) cause to be waived all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting period with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable such employees and their eligible dependents under
the New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting period would apply under the analogous Company Employee Plan; (ii)
provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the
Effective Time under a Company Employee Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under the analogous Company Employee Plan prior to the

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-
of-pocket requirements under any New Plan; and (iii) provide each Continuing
Employee with service credit for eligibility and vesting purposes and solely
for purposes of vacation, sick and paid time off policies or arrangements
benefit accrual under any New Plan in which Continuing Employees are eligible
to participate for all periods of employment with the Company or any its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing service recognition shall not apply to the extent it would result
in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, such service was
not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Plan, or for benefit
accrual purposes under any New Plan, other than vacation, sick and paid time
off.

  



  

(e) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company and
Standard Bank shall obtain from Timothy K. Zimmerman, Andrew W. Hasley
and Susan A. Parente, in the forms included in _Section 5.11(e) of the
Parent's Disclosure Letter_, an agreement (a "Cancellation Agreement") to
accept in full settlement of his or her rights under their respective
employment agreements and termination of the employment agreements, the
amounts and benefits determined under his or her Cancellation Agreement (the
aggregate amounts of such payments to be specified in _Section 5.11(e) of
the Parent's Disclosure Letter_) and pay such amounts to such individuals who
are employed at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of each Cancellation
Agreement. In addition, Parent intends to enter into new arrangements with
certain Company executives, as disclosed in _Section 5.11(e) of the Parent's
Disclosure Letter_, which will describe certain terms and conditions of their
"at will" employment and Company and Standard Bank will use reasonable
efforts to enter into Cancellation Agreements with Standard Bank employees
with a change in control agreement as specified in _Section 5.11(e) of the
Parent's Disclosure Letter_.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, references to "Parent" or the
"Company" in this _Section 5.11_ shall also include any Subsidiary of Parent
or Subsidiary of the Company, respectively, as the context requires.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this _Section 5.11_ will
not create any third-party beneficiary rights, nor will it be enforceable by
any employee, any person representing the interest of employees, or any
spouse, dependent, or beneficiary of any employee, nor will anything herein
be deemed an amendment to any employee benefit plan.

  



  

5.12 Indemnification.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party"), and any person who becomes
an Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the Effective Time, against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or was prior
to the Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a
director, officer, employee, trustee or partner of another corporation,
partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other entity or
(ii) any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to the fullest extent such person would have been indemnified
or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the Company's
articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and as permitted by applicable law, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, _provided_ that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such person
is not entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section 5.12(a)_, upon learning of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. Any
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under
_Section 5.12(a)_ unless and to the extent that Parent is actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure.

  



  

(c) (i) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause to be maintained, in
effect for six (6) years following the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies covering the officers
and directors of Company and Standard Bank (provided, that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions which are not materially less favorable) with respect to
claims against such officers and directors arising from facts or events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall Parent be required to expend in the aggregate pursuant to this
_Section 5.12(c)_ more than 225% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company or Standard Bank for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount");
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of the annual premium necessary
to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Insurance Amount,
Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of directors' and officers'
insurance that, in Parent's good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Insurance Amount;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may (i) request the Company to obtain an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy or (ii) substitute therefor "tail"
policies the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to such person's than the Company's
existing insurance policies as of the date hereof.

  



  

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves, transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then,
and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be
made so that such successor

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

and assign of Parent and its successors and assigns assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.12_.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her representatives.

  



  

(f) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Section 5.12_
are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1828(k)) and the regulations
promulgated thereunder by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (12
C.F.R. Part 359).

  



  

5.13 Separate Banking Subsidiary; Post-Closing Governance.

  



  

(a) _Separate Banking Subsidiary_. Standard Bank will be maintained as
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent for a period of at least one
year following the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) _Resignation of Directors_. Each director of Company and each
director of Standard Bank will resign such position with the Company and
Standard Bank by delivering, at least three days prior to Closing, a written
letter of resignation to be effective at the Effective Time. Effective at the
Effective Time, the persons listed in _Section 5.13(b) of the Parent's
Disclosure Letter_ shall be the directors of the Company and Standard Bank.

  



  

(c) _Advisory Board_. The current directors of Standard Bank listed in
_Section 5.13(c) of the Parent's Disclosure Letter_ shall be offered a
position, for a period of two years following the Effective Date, on an
advisory board (the "Advisory Board") to be established by Standard Bank.
Fees to be paid to Advisory Board members are set forth in _Section 5.13(c)
of the Parent's Disclosure Letter_; provided, however, that service on the
Advisory Board and fees paid to Advisory Board members remain subject to any
required regulatory approval.

  



  

(d) _Senior Officers of Standard Bank_. Certain senior officers of
Standard Bank shall be offered positions with Standard Bank, with the titles
set forth in _Section 5.13(d) of the Parent's Disclosure Letter_, and shall
be eligible to participate in any employee benefit plans and policies as may
be provided to employees of Standard Bank as a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent.

  



  

5.14 Company Charitable Foundation. The Company has listed the current
members of the board of directors of the Company Charitable Foundation in
_Section 5.14 of the Company's Disclosure Letter_, and Company shall use its
best efforts to cause such individuals to remain on the board of directors of
the Company Charitable Foundation until the Effective Time. Company agrees
that, as of the Effective Time, it will use its best efforts to take all
necessary action such that (i) the Company Charitable Foundation is merged
with the Parent Charitable Foundation, and the current directors of the
Company Charitable Foundation set forth on _Section 5.14 of the Company's
Disclosure Letter_ shall resign.

  



  

5.15 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

5.16 Exchange Act Deregistration. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable SEC
rules to enable the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

  



  

5.17 ESOP Matters. The Trustee and the Company shall take or cause to
be taken all such actions as may be necessary to effect the actions set forth
below relating to the ESOP prior to or simultaneous with the Closing, as
applicable: Effective at least five (5) business days before the Closing
(with relevant materials provided to Parent for its review and comment at
least three (3) business days prior to such date), the ESOP shall be
terminated (the "ESOP Termination Date"), no new participants shall be
admitted on or after the ESOP Termination Date, no further distributions in
the form of "qualifying employer securities" (as defined in Section 407 of
ERISA) will be permitted, and all existing ESOP participants' accounts shall
be fully vested and 100% non-forfeitable. The Company shall cause the ESOP's
plan administrator to direct the Trustee to remit a sufficient amount of the
Suspense Shares back to the Company to repay the outstanding ESOP Loan in
full, and the proceeds of the sale of the Suspense Shares shall be used to
repay the outstanding balance of the ESOP Loan as of the Effective Time, with
each remitted share to be valued equal to the Merger Consideration. All
remaining shares of Company Common Stock held by the ESOP as of the Effective
Time shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration within the ESOP in
accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_. After repayment of the outstanding ESOP
Loan and the exchange of the shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration, the cash received upon conversion of the remaining Suspense
Shares shall be deemed to be earnings and shall be allocated to ESOP
participants' accounts as earnings. Promptly, after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company will take such actions as may be necessary to request
a favorable determination letter with respect to the ESOP's termination. No
benefit distributions shall be made from the ESOP without the prior written
consent of Parent before the IRS issues a favorable determination letter with
respect to the tax-qualified status of the ESOP on termination, except that
distributions from the ESOP may be made earlier if required by law or upon
the occurrence of the ESOP participant's retirement, death, disability or
termination of employment or any other event, other than plan termination,
that requires a distribution from the ESOP. The Company also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating the ESOP as Parent may reasonably
request prior to the Closing, including the adoption of amendments to the
ESOP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Standard Bank will continue to make
regularly scheduled payments on the ESOP Loan and related share allocations
through the ESOP Termination Date.

  



  

5.18 Disclosure Supplements. From time to time prior to the Effective
Time, the Company and Parent will promptly supplement or amend their
respective Disclosure Letters delivered in connection herewith with respect to
any matter hereafter arising that, if existing, occurring or known at the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Disclosure Letters or that is necessary to correct any
information in such Disclosure Letters that has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

amendment to such Disclosure Letters shall have any effect for determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VI.

  



  

5.19 Charter Conversion or Section 10(l) Election. Company and
Standard Bank shall not take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause Standard Bank to not be eligible to be a Qualified Thrift
Lender or to obtain any required Charter Conversion Approval or Section 10(
_l_ ) Approval, as applicable, or fail to use reasonable efforts to ensure
that Standard Bank continues to be eligible to be a Qualified Thrift Lender at
the time of Closing or to obtain any required Charter Conversion Approval or
Section 10( _l_ ) Approval. Company and Standard Bank agree to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to, prior to the Effective Time, have Standard
Bank, upon consultation with Parent, either (i) convert from a Pennsylvania
chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank or
(ii) make an election under section 10( _l_ ) of HOLA to be deemed a savings
association for the purpose of the Company being deemed a savings and loan
holding company under section 10 of HOLA and to obtain any required Charter
Conversion Approval or Section 10( _l_ ) Approval.

termination is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,

omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement; or (b) will be construed

   | | Affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person not a party to this Agreement any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise and shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the rights under this Agreement
are assignable by Dollar to a majority-owned Affiliate or any successor-in-
interest of Dollar, but no such assignment shall relieve Dollar of its
obligations hereunder.  
---|---|--- 
  

  



   | 8.| _Remedies/Specific Enforcement_. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically
enforceable pursuant to its terms and that Dollar would be irreparably
harmed if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with its specific terms and that monetary damages would not
provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by the Stockholder of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which Dollar
may be entitled (including monetary damages), Dollar shall be entitled to
seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof, and
the Stockholder hereby waives any defense in any action for
specific performance or an injunction or other equitable relief that a remedy
at law would be adequate. The Stockholder further agrees that neither Dollar
nor any other person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this paragraph, and the Stockholder
irrevocably waives any right he or she may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

   | 9.| _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
without regard to any applicable conflict of law principles. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10.| _Notice_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by
electronic mail (with confirmation), mailed by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) or delivered by an express courier (with
confirmation) if to the Stockholder, to the address or e-mail address, as
applicable, set forth in _Schedule A_ hereto, and if to Dollar, in accordance
with Section 8.7 of the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 11.| _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.| _Amendments; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed (a) in the case of an

   | | amendment, by Dollar and the Stockholder, and (b) in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.| _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW
AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II)
THE PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER;
(III) THE PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) THE PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13_.

   | 14.| _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement in one or
more counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic signature. All
