(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not prior thereto have been terminated
in accordance with its express terms, the closing of the Merger (the "
**Closing** ") shall occur through the mail or at a place that is mutually
acceptable to Acquiror and the Company, or if they fail to agree, at the
offices of Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum and Nagelberg LLP, located at 200 West
Madison Street, Suite 3900, Chicago, Illinois 60606, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in **Article 8** and **Article 9** (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at
such other time and place as Acquiror and the Company may agree in writing
(the " **Closing Date** "). Subject to the provisions of **Article 10**,
failure to consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place
determined pursuant to this **Section 1.2** will not result in the
termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation
under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree to file on the Closing Date articles of merger
with the Nevada Secretary of State (the " **Nevada Articles of Merger** "),
and articles of merger with the Missouri Secretary of State (the " **Missouri
Articles of Merger** "). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and
time specified in the Nevada Articles of Merger (the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

 **Section 1.3** **_Effects of the Merger_.** At and after the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions
of the NRS and the GBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at
the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company shall be vested in the Surviving Entity, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

 



 

 **Section 1.4** **_Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity_**. The
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Acquiror, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

 **Section 1.5** **_Bank Merger_**. The parties will cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to effect the Bank Merger at a time to be determined
following the Merger. At the effective time of the Bank Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Bank will terminate. Acquiror Bank will be the
surviving bank and will continue its corporate existence under applicable
Legal Requirements. The Bank Merger shall be accomplished pursuant to a merger
agreement containing such terms and conditions as are ordinary and customary
for affiliated bank merger transactions of such type.

 



 

 **Section 1.6** **_Alternative Structure_.** Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, the parties
may mutually agree to change the method of effecting the Contemplated
Transactions if and to the extent that they deem such a change to be
desirable; _provided_ , that: (a) any such change shall not affect the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company Common
Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of
the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as
consideration in the Merger or (ii) materially impede

 



      
 

 



 

or delay consummation of the Merger. If the parties agree to make such a
change, they shall execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

 **Section 2.1** **_Consideration_**.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Acquiror, the Company, or the holder of any shares of Company
Common Stock and subject to **Section 2.3**, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
for shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or Acquiror (in each
case other than shares of Company Common Stock held in any Company Benefit
Plan or related trust accounts or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be converted
into the right to receive 0.79 fully paid and nonassessable shares (the "
**Exchange Ratio** ") of Acquiror Common Stock (the " **Merger Consideration**
").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this **Section 2.1** to the contrary, at the
Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock
held in the Companys treasury will be cancelled and no shares of Acquiror
Common Stock or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange
therefor.

 



 

 **Section 2.2** **_Cancellation of Shares_.** At the Effective Time, the
shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Certificates (it being
understood that any reference herein to a "certificate" shall be deemed to
include reference to a book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of Company Common Stock) that represented Company Common Stock before the
Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to
receive: (a) a certificate (or evidence of book-entry as determined by
Acquiror in its sole discretion) representing the number of whole shares of
Acquiror Common Stock into which they were converted pursuant to this
**Article 2**; (b) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such certificate have been converted into
the right to receive pursuant to **Section 2.1** and **Section 2.3**,
without any interest thereon; and (c) any dividends or distributions that the
holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to **Section 2.4(f)**.

 



 

 **Section 2.3** **_No Fractional Shares_.** Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock shall be issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of
Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional
share of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to this **Article 2** shall instead
be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the
nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying the Acquiror Common Stock Price
by the fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock to which such former holder
would otherwise be entitled.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 2.4** **_Exchange of Certificates_**.

 



 

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare Trust Company,
N.A. shall serve, pursuant to the terms of an exchange agent agreement, as the
exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the " **Exchange Agent** ");
and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent agreement at or prior to
the Effective Time. Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the payment of
any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall authorize the issuance
of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this **Article
2**: (i) a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for payment of
the Merger Consideration pursuant to **Section 2.1**, and (ii) sufficient
cash for payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock in accordance with **Section 2.3**. Such amount of cash and shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to in this
**Article 2** as the " **Conversion Fund**."

 



 

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (" **Company Stock
Certificates** ") a letter of transmittal (" **Letter of Transmittal** "), in
a form to be agreed by the parties, which specifies, among other things, that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the
Exchange Agent, together with instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Upon proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Merger Consideration plus cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with
**Section 2.3** deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Stock Certificate; thereupon such Company Stock
Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable upon surrender of a
Company Stock Certificate.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of Outstanding Company Shares.

 



 

(f) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Acquiror
Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with this **Article 2**. Promptly after the
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this **Article
2**, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were
converted at the Effective Time pursuant to **Section 2.1**.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
**Article 2** shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its
successors in interest, for issuance of Acquiror Common stock pursuant to the
Merger Consideration and the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares
deliverable in respect of such stockholders shares of Company Common Stock,
as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such
Acquiror Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws.

 



 

(h) In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with
this **Article 2**, shares of Acquiror Common stock pursuant to the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(i) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

 **Section 2.5** **_Company Equity Awards_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the
Acquiror shall assume the Company Stock Plans, and by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option granted by
the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under a Company Stock
Plan or otherwise, whether vested or unvested (a " **Company Stock Option**
"), that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be fully vested and be converted into an option award to purchase
Acquiror Common Stock with respect to the number of whole shares of Acquiror
Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at
an exercise price per share of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Company Stock Plan, if any, pursuant to which such Company
Stock Option was granted and/or any associated award agreement. It is intended
that the conversion of Company Stock Options

 



      
 

 



 

under this **Section 2.5(a)** shall comply with Sections 409A and 424 of the
Code, to the extent applicable, and this **Section 2.5(a)** shall be
construed consistent with such intent.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each restricted stock award in respect of a share of Company Common
Stock, subject solely to service vesting, granted under a Company Stock Plan
or otherwise, (a " **Company Restricted Stock Award** "), which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested and each holder
thereof shall become a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each Company Equity Award that is subject to a performance vesting
condition, in whole or in part, granted under a Company Stock Plan or
otherwise, including, but not limited to, performance stock or performance
stock units (a " **Company Performance Stock Award** "), that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed earned at target
performance (as listed in **Section 2.5(c)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules) and be converted into a service based restricted stock or
restricted stock unit award of Acquiror Common Stock with respect to the
number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole share), with full vesting occurring at the
end of the previous vesting term subject to early vesting upon an involuntary
termination without cause or retirement, and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Company Stock Plan, if any, pursuant to which such Company
Performance Stock Award was granted and/or any associated award agreement. It
is intended that the conversion of Company Performance Stock Awards under this
**Section 2.5(c)** shall comply with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
applicable, and this **Section 2.5(c)** shall be construed consistent with
such intent.

 



 

(d) Immediately following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall file a post-
effective amendment to the Form S-4 or an effective registration statement on
Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock subject to Company Equity Awards, shall distribute a prospectus
relating to such Form S-8, if applicable, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as such Company Equity Awards (as converted) remain outstanding.

 



 

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and its
compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take
any actions that are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
**Section 2.5**.

 



 

 **Section 2.6** **_Dissenting Shares_**. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who properly shall have demanded payment of the fair
value for such shares in accordance with the GBCL (collectively, the "
**Dissenters  Shares**") shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

Such stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the
GBCL, except that all Dissenters Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost
their rights as dissenting shareholders under the GBCL shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the
Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the
Merger Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of
the certificate(s) that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced
such shares. The Company shall give Acquiror: (a) prompt notice of any written
demands for payment of fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the GBCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders
dissenters rights; and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands under the GBCL consistent with the
obligations of the Company thereunder. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Acquiror, (x) make any payment with respect to such
demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any demand for payment of fair value or
(z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for payment of fair
value or timely take any other action to perfect payment of fair value rights
in accordance with the GBCL **.**

 **Section 3.7** **_Company SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports;
Regulatory Filings_**.

 



 

(a) The Company has timely filed all Company SEC Reports, except where the
failure to file any Company SEC Report, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, and all such Company SEC Reports complied as to form in all
material respects, as of their respective filing dates and effective dates, as
the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the Securities

 



       
 

 



 

Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder. The Company SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective
filing dates, none of the Company SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof,
there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC
with respect to any of the Company SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of the Company
is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the
Company SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such
statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements
presented in the Company SEC Reports (collectively, the " **Company Financial
Statements** ") are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly
and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities
and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Company Financial
Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of
unaudited Company Financial Statements. The Company Financial Statements do
not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities, absolute or
contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would render the
Company Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as of the
respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein. As of the
date hereof, KPMG LLP has not resigned (or informed the Company that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent registered public
accountants of the Company.

 



 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all of the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any
of its Subsidiaries. The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in reports that the Company is required to file under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. As of June 30, 2015, to the
Knowledge of the Company, such controls and procedures were effective, in all
material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

 



 

(d) The Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and
maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (within the
meaning of Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) (" **Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting** "). The Companys certifying officers have
evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed
quarterly report on Form 10-Q of the Company under the Exchange Act (the "
**Company Evaluation Date** "). The Company presented in such quarterly report
the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of the
Companys Internal Control Over Financial

 



      
 

 



 

Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Company Evaluation Date. Since
the Company Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in the Companys
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting. The Company has devised and maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that:
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

 



 

(e) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed since January 1, 2013, with all applicable
federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent
failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed
prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any event or
occurrence since January 1, 2013 that would result in a determination that the
Bank is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. §
303.2(r).

 



 

 **Section 3.8** **_Books and Records_.** The books of account, minute books,
stock record books and other records of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in
accordance with the Companys business practices and all applicable Legal
Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal
controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and
transactions included therein.

 



 

 **Section 3.9** **_Properties_**.

 



 

(a) **Section 3.9** of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists or describes
all interests in real property owned by the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, including OREO, as of the date of this Agreement, together with
the address of such real estate, and each lease of real property to which it
is a party, and in each case of either owned or leased real property, the
proper identification, if applicable, of each such property as a branch or
main office or other office.

 



 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to
all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible,
that it purports to own, subject to no liens, mortgages, security interests,
encumbrances or charges of any kind except: (i) as noted in the most recent
Company Financial Statements; (ii) statutory liens for Taxes not

 



      
 

 



 

yet delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and
for which appropriate reserves have been established and reflected in the
Company Financial Statements; (iii) pledges or liens required to be granted in
connection with the acceptance of government deposits, granted in connection
with repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or otherwise incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business; (iv) easements, rights of way, and other similar
encumbrances that do not materially affect the present use of the properties
or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair
the present business operations at such properties; (v) minor defects and
irregularities in title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use
thereof for the purposes for which they are held as of the date of this
Agreement; (vi) liens or deposits in connection with workers compensation,
unemployment insurance, social security or other insurance; (vii) liens
existing on any asset of any Person at the time such Person is acquired by or
is combined with the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, provided
the lien was not created in contemplation of that event; (viii) liens on
property required by Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve; and (ix)
liens incidental to the conduct of business or ownership of property of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which do not in the aggregate materially
detract from the value of the property or materially impair the use thereof as
of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " **Company Permitted
Exceptions** "). The Company and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the
right under valid and existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any
and all of the respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid
and without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the lessor. To the Knowledge of the Company, all buildings and
structures owned by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries lie wholly within
the boundaries of the real property owned or validly leased by it, and do not
encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the property rights
of, any other Person.

 



 

 **Section 3.10** **_Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_**.

 



 

(a) Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by the
Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension
thereof (the " **Company Loans** ") reflected as an asset on any of the
Company Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities
is evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all
material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of the Company, the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or equitable principles or doctrines.

 



 

(b) All Company Loans originated or purchased by the Bank were made or
purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of the
Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Bank. The Banks interest
in all Company Loans is free and clear of any security interest, lien,
encumbrance or other charge, and, the Bank has complied in all material
respects with all Legal Requirements relating to such Company Loans.

 



 

(c) **Section 3.10(c)** of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists, as of
September 30, 2015, each Company Loan: (i) under the terms of which the
obligor is more than ninety (90) days delinquent in payment of principal or
interest or in default of any other material provision as of the dates shown
thereon or for which the Bank has discontinued the accrual of

 



      
 

 



 

interest; (ii) that has been classified as "substandard," "doubtful," "loss,"
"other loans especially mentioned" or any comparable classifications by the
Bank; (iii) that has been listed on any "watch list" or similar internal
report of the Bank; (iv) that has been the subject of any notice from any
obligor of adverse environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of
any collateral for such Company Loan; (v) with respect to which the Bank has
Knowledge of potential violations of any Environmental Laws that may have
occurred on the property serving as collateral for such Company Loan or by any
obligor of such Company Loan; or (vi) that represents an extension of credit
to an executive officer or director of the Bank or an entity controlled by an
executive officer or director.

 



 

(d) The Banks allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the Company
Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on the basis
of the Banks continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of Company
Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established
in a manner consistent with the Banks internal policies, and, in the
reasonable judgment of the Bank, was adequate in all material respects under
the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide for possible or
specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Company Loans previously
charged-off, on outstanding Company Loans.

 



 

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company: (i) none of the Company Loans is subject
to any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan
balances in excess of the Banks allowance for loan and lease losses are,
based on past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms
(except as limited above) and all uncollectible loans have been charged off.

 



 

 **Section 3.11** **_Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed
(taking into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to be
filed by them, and each such Tax Return is true, correct and complete in all
material respects. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have paid, or made
adequate provision for the payment of, all Taxes (whether or not reflected in
Tax Returns as filed or to be filed) due and payable by the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries, or claimed to be due and payable by any Regulatory
Authority, and are not delinquent in the payment of any Tax, except such Taxes
as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have
been provided.

 



 

(b) There is no claim or assessment pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes
that they owe. No audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid
or payable by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is presently being
conducted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by any Regulatory
Authority. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, and there are no liens
for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the Companys
or its Subsidiaries assets. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has
executed an extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the
assessment or collection of any Tax that is currently in effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have delivered or made available
to Acquiror true, correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns relating to
income taxes and franchise taxes owed by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to the last three (3) fiscal years.

 



 

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have not engaged in any transaction that could materially affect the Tax
liability for any Tax Returns not closed by applicable statute of limitations:
(i) which is a "reportable transaction" or a "listed transaction" or (ii) a
"significant purpose of which is the avoidance or evasion of U.S. federal
income tax" within the meaning of Sections 6662, 6662A, 6011, 6111 or 6707A of
the Code or of the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury
promulgated thereunder or pursuant to notices or other guidance published by

 **Section 3.12** **_Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) **Section 3.12(a)** of the Company Disclosure Schedules includes a
complete and correct list of each Company Benefit Plan. The Company has
delivered or made available to Acquiror true and complete copies of the
following with respect to each material Company Benefit Plan: (i) a copy of
the Companys current employee policy manual, (ii) copies of each Company
Benefit Plan (or a written description where no formal plan document exists),
and all related plan descriptions and other material written communications
provided to participants of Company Benefit Plans; (iii) to the extent
applicable, the last three (3) years annual reports on Form 5500, including
all schedules thereto and the opinions of independent accountants; and (iv)
the following documents related to each Company Benefit Plan:

 



 

(i) all material contracts with third party administrators, actuaries,
investment managers, consultants, insurers, and independent contractors;

 



 

(ii) all notices and other material written communications that were given by
the Company, any Subsidiary, or any Company Benefit Plan to the IRS, the DOL
or the PBGC pursuant to applicable law within the six (6) years preceding the
date of this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) all notices or other material written communications that were given by
the IRS, the PBGC, or the DOL to the Company, any Subsidiary, or any Company
Benefit Plan within the six (6) years preceding the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of
employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or
acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under any Company Benefit
Plan or any other increase in the liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary
under any Company Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. No Company Benefit Plan provides for payment of any amount
which, considered in the aggregate with amounts payable pursuant to all other
Company Benefit Plans, would result in any amount being non-deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of Company ERISA Affiliates sponsors,
maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained,
administered or contributed to, or has, has had or, could have any liability
with respect to, (i) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA), (ii) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA), or (iii) any self-insured plan (including any plan
pursuant to which a stop loss policy or contract applies). With respect to any
Company Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section
413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional employer
organization, such Company Benefit Plan complies in all respects with the
requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither the Company nor any of the
Company ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or
remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled
individuals. Neither the Company nor any of the Company ERISA Affiliates
sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored,
maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any
liability with respect to, any Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any tax-qualified
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA). No Company
Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of accrued
liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

 



 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401
and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under the Code and
that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section 501 of the
Code (or the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an opinion
letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and, to the Companys Knowledge,
there are no facts or circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified
status of any Company Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related
trust.

 



 

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(f) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of
Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Company
Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of
any Company Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or
federal law or violation of any Company Benefit Plan document or related
agreement.

 



 

(g) No Company Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any
liability to any Company Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other
person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable law by reason of
any action or failure to act in connection with any Company Benefit Plan,
including any liability by any reason of any payment of, or failure to pay,
benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any credit or failure to give
credit for any benefits or rights. To the Companys Knowledge, no party in
interest (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Company Benefit Plan
has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited transaction (as described in Code
Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

 



 

(h) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by the Company or
any Subsidiary to any Company Benefit Plan (i) through the date hereof have
been made or reserves adequate for such purposes have been set aside therefor
and reflected in Company

 



      
 

 



 

Financial Statements and (ii) through the Closing Date will have been made or
reserves adequate for such purposes will have been set aside therefore and
reflected in the Company Financial Statements.

 



 

(i) There are no obligations under any Company Benefit Plans to provide health
or other welfare benefits to retirees or other former employees, directors,
consultants or their dependents (other than rights under Section 4980B of the
Code or Section 601 of ERISA or comparable state laws).

 



 

(j) No condition exists as a result of which the Company or any Subsidiary
would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Company
Benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a person performing
services for the Company or any Subsidiary as an independent contractor rather
than as an employee. All individuals participating in Company Benefit Plans
are in fact eligible and authorized to participate in such Company Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities to
employees or former employees that are not reflected in the Company Benefit
Plans.

 



 

 **Section 3.13** **_Compliance with Legal Requirements_**. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates, permits,
franchises and rights from all appropriate Regulatory Authorities necessary

Subsidiaries is, and at all times since January 1, 2013, has been, in
compliance with each Legal Requirement that is or was applicable to it or to
the conduct or operation of its respective businesses or the ownership or use
of any of its respective assets, except where noncompliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, at any
time since January 1, 2013, any notice or other communication (whether oral or
written) from any Regulatory Authority or any other Person regarding: (a) any

Requirement.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no Order imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger,
would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates) that would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. No officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order that prohibits such officer,
director, employee or agent from engaging in or continuing any conduct,

dividends or interest or limits in any material manner its credit or risk
management policies, its management or its business. To the Knowledge of the
Company, since January 1, 2014, none of the foregoing has been threatened by
any Regulatory Authority.

 



 

 **Section 3.15** **_Absence of Certain Changes and Events_**. Since
September 30, 2014, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in the Ordinary Course of Business and no event or

Disclosure Schedules lists all insurance policies and bonds owned or held as
of the date of this Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to their respective business, operations, properties or assets (including
bankers blanket bond and insurance providing benefits for employees), true,
complete and correct copies of each of which have been delivered or made
available to Acquiror. The Company and its Subsidiaries are insured with
reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management of
the Company reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent with
industry practice. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with their insurance policies and are not in default under
any of the terms thereof. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force
and effect and, except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of
officers, directors and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the

policies. All premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been
paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

 **Section 3.19** **_Compliance with Environmental Laws_**. There are no
actions, suits, investigations, liabilities, inquiries, Proceedings or Orders
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
assets that are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor
to the Knowledge of the Company, is there any factual basis for any of the
foregoing, as a result of any asserted failure of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of, or any predecessor thereof, to comply with any Environmental
Law. No environmental clearances or other governmental approvals are required
for the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. To the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the owner of any

 



       
 

 



 

interest in real estate on which any substances have been generated, used,
stored, deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which substances if known
to be present on, at or under such property, would require notification to any
Regulatory Authority, clean up, removal or some other remedial action under
any Environmental Law at such property or any impacted adjacent or down
gradient property, except where such action would not reasonably be expected

agreement.

similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to
general principles of equity), and are in full force and effect. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations under the

accrued and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no breaches,

 **Section 4.7** **_Acquiror SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports;
Regulatory Filings_**.

 



 

(a) Acquiror has timely filed all Acquiror SEC Reports, except where the
failure to file any Acquiror SEC Report, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Acquiror, and all such Acquiror SEC Reports complied as to form in all
material respects, as of their respective filing dates and effective dates, as
the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder. The Acquiror SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective
filing dates, none of the Acquiror SEC Reports contained an untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof,
there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC
with respect to any of the Acquiror SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Acquiror is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the
Acquiror SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such
statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements
presented in the Acquiror SEC Reports (collectively, the " **Acquiror
Financial Statements** ") are complete and correct in all material respects
and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets,
liabilities and results of operations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Acquiror Financial
Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of
unaudited Acquiror Financial Statements. The Acquiror Financial Statements do
not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities, absolute or
contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would render the
Acquiror Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as

 



      
 

 



 

of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein. As
of the date hereof, McGladrey LLP has not resigned (or informed Acquiror that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent registered public
accountants of Acquiror.

 



 

(c) Acquiror is in compliance in all material respects with all of the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any
of its Subsidiaries. Acquiror maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by Acquiror in reports that Acquiror is required to file under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to Acquirors management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. As of September 30, 2015, to the
Knowledge of Acquiror, such controls and procedures were effective, in all
material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

 



 

(d) Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained
a system of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Acquirors certifying
officers have evaluated the effectiveness of Acquirors Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently
filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Acquiror under the Exchange Act (the "
**Acquiror Evaluation Date** "). Acquiror presented in such quarterly report
the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of
Acquirors Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their
evaluations as of the Acquiror Evaluation Date. Since the Acquiror Evaluation
Date, there have been no changes in Acquirors Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Acquirors Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Acquiror has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

 



 

(e) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed since January 1, 2013, with all applicable
federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent
failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed
prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there has not been any event or occurrence
since January 1, 2013 that would result in a determination that Acquiror Bank
is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r).

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 4.8** **_Books and Records_.** The books of account, minute books,
stock record books and other records of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are
complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in
accordance with Acquirors business practices and all applicable Legal
Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal
controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of Acquiror and
each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and
transactions included therein.

 



 

 **Section 4.9** **_Properties_**. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has
good and marketable title to all assets and properties, whether real or
personal, tangible or intangible, that it purports to own, subject to no
liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or charges of any kind
except: (i) as noted in the most recent Acquiror Financial Statements; (ii)
statutory liens for Taxes not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith
by appropriate Proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been
established and reflected in the Acquiror Financial Statements; (iii) pledges
or liens required to be granted in connection with the acceptance of
government deposits, granted in connection with repurchase or reverse
repurchase agreements or otherwise incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business; (iv) easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that
do not materially affect the present use of the properties or assets subject
thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair the present
business operations at such properties; (v) minor defects and irregularities
in title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for
the purposes for which they are held as of the date of this Agreement; (vi)
liens or deposits in connection with workers compensation, unemployment
insurance, social security or other insurance; (vii) liens existing on any
asset of any Person at the time such Person is acquired by or is combined with
Acquiror or any of Acquirors Subsidiaries, provided the lien was not created
in contemplation of that event; (viii) liens on property required by
Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve; and (ix) liens incidental to
the conduct of business or ownership of property of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries which do not in the aggregate materially detract from the value
of the property or materially impair the use thereof as of the date of this
Agreement. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the right under
valid and existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any and all of
the respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without
default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, the lessor.

 



 

 **Section 4.10** **_Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_**.

 



 

(a) Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by
Acquiror Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or
extension thereof (the " **Acquiror Loans** ") reflected as an asset on any of
the Acquiror Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory
Authorities is evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally
sufficient in all material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of
Acquiror, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named
therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or equitable principles or
doctrines.

 



 

(b) All Acquiror Loans originated or purchased by Acquiror Bank were made or
purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of
Acquiror Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of Acquiror Bank.

Loans is free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other
charge, and, Acquiror Bank has complied in all material respects with all
Legal Requirements relating to such Acquiror Loans.

 



 

(c) Acquiror Banks allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the
Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on
the basis of Acquiror Banks continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio
of Acquiror Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was
established in a manner consistent with Acquiror Banks internal policies,
and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank, was adequate in all material
respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide
for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans
previously charged-off, on outstanding Acquiror Loans.

(a) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed
by them, and each such Tax Return is true, correct and complete in all
material respects. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have paid, or made
adequate provision for the payment of, all Taxes (whether or not reflected in
Tax Returns as filed or to be filed) due and payable by Acquiror and each of
its Subsidiaries, or claimed to be due and payable by any Regulatory
Authority, and are not delinquent in the payment of any Tax, except such Taxes
as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have
been provided.

 



 

(b) There is no claim or assessment pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror,
threatened against Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that they owe.
No audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid or payable by
Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries is presently being conducted or, to the
Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened by any Regulatory Authority. Neither
Acquiror nor its Subsidiaries are the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any Tax Return, and there are no liens for Taxes (other
than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of Acquirors or its

(d) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have
not engaged in any transaction that could materially affect the Tax liability
for any Tax Returns not closed by applicable statute of limitations: (i) which
is a "reportable transaction" or a "listed

 



       
 

 



 

transaction" or (ii) a "significant purpose of which is the avoidance or
evasion of U.S. federal income tax" within the meaning of Sections 6662,
6662A, 6011, 6111 or 6707A of the Code or of the regulations of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury promulgated thereunder or pursuant to notices or
other guidance published by the IRS (irrespective of the effective dates).

 



 

 **Section 4.12** **_Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of
employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or
acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under any Acquiror Benefit
Plan or any other increase in the liabilities of Acquiror or any Subsidiary
under any Acquiror Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) With respect to any Acquiror Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer
plan" (as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through
a professional employer organization, such Acquiror Benefit Plan complies in
all respects with the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither Acquiror
nor any of Acquiror ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the
payment and/or remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf
of enrolled individuals. Neither Acquiror nor any of the Acquiror ERISA
Affiliates sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever
sponsored, maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or
could have any liability with respect to, any Acquiror Benefit Plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any
tax-qualified "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA).
No Acquiror Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of
accrued liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

 



 

(c) Each Acquiror Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401
and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under the Code and
that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section 501 of the
Code (or Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an opinion
letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and, to Acquirors Knowledge, there
are no facts or circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified status
of any Acquiror Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related trust.

 



 

(d) Each Acquiror Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(e) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of
Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to
Acquirors Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Acquiror
Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of
any Acquiror Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or
federal law or violation of any Acquiror Benefit Plan document or related
agreement.

 



 

(f) No Acquiror Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had,
any liability to any Acquiror Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any
other person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable law by
reason of any action or failure to act in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any Acquiror Benefit Plan, including any liability by any
reason of any payment of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or
by reason of any credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights.
To Acquirors Knowledge, no party in interest (as defined in Code Section
4975(e)(2)) of any Acquiror Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt
prohibited transaction (as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section
406).

 



 

(g) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by Acquiror or any
Subsidiary to any Acquiror Benefit Plan have been made or reserves adequate
for such purposes have been set aside therefor and reflected in Acquiror
Financial Statements.

 



 

(h) No condition exists as a result of which Acquiror or any Subsidiary would
have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Acquiror Benefit
Plan with respect to any misclassification of a person performing services for
Acquiror or any Subsidiary as an independent contractor rather than as an
employee. All individuals participating in Acquiror Benefit Plans are in fact
eligible and authorized to participate in such Acquiror Benefit Plan.

 



 

(i) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities to
employees or former employees that are not reflected in the Acquiror Benefit
Plans.

of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates, permits,
franchises and rights from all appropriate Regulatory Authorities necessary

Subsidiaries is, and at all times since January 1, 2013, has been, in
compliance with each Legal Requirement that is or was applicable to it or to
the conduct or operation of its respective businesses or the ownership or use
of any of its respective assets, except where noncompliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Acquiror. Except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror,
neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, at any time since
January 1, 2013, any notice or other communication (whether oral or written)
from any Regulatory Authority or any other Person regarding: (a) any actual,
alleged, possible, or potential violation of, or failure to comply with, any
Legal Requirement; or (b) any actual, alleged, possible, or potential
obligation on the part of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake, or
to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action of any nature
in connection with a failure to comply with any Legal Requirement.

 



 

 **Section 4.14** **_Legal Proceedings; Orders_**.

 



 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, neither Acquiror nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, Proceedings against Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no Order imposed on Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries
that would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. No officer, director, employee or agent of
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order that prohibits
such officer, director, employee or agent from engaging in or continuing any
conduct, activity or practice relating to the businesses of Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

material respect the conduct of its business, in any manner relates to its
capital adequacy, restricts its ability to pay dividends or interest or limits
in any material manner its credit or risk management policies, its management
or its business. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, none of the foregoing has been
threatened by any Regulatory Authority.

 



 

 **Section 4.15** **_Absence of Certain Changes and Events_**. Since December
31, 2014, no event or events have occurred that had or would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Acquiror.

 



 

 **Section 4.16** **_Compliance with Environmental Laws_**. There are no
actions, suits, investigations, liabilities, inquiries, Proceedings or Orders
involving Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
assets that are pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, nor to
the Knowledge of Acquiror, is there any factual basis for any of the
foregoing, as a result of any asserted failure of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries of, or any predecessor thereof, to comply with any Environmental
Law. No environmental clearances or other governmental approvals are required
for the conduct of the business of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. To the Knowledge of Acquiror,
neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is the owner of any interest in
real estate on which any substances have been generated, used, stored,
deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which substances if known to be
present on, at or under such property, would require notification to any
Regulatory Authority, clean up, removal or some other remedial action under
any Environmental Law at such property or any impacted adjacent or down
gradient property, except where such action would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Acquiror and each Subsidiary
of Acquiror has complied in all material respects with all Environmental Laws
applicable to it and its business operations.

 



 

 **Section 4.17** **_Brokerage Commissions_.** Except for fees payable to FIG
Partners, LLC pursuant to an engagement letter that has been Previously
Disclosed, none of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, has incurred any obligation or liability, contingent or
otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or other
similar payment in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 4.18** **_Approval Delays_.** To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there
is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals
would be denied or unduly delayed. Acquiror Banks most recent CRA rating was
"satisfactory" or better.

 



 

 **Section 4.19** **_No Other Representations or Warranties_**.

 



 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this
Article 4, neither Acquiror nor any other Person makes any express or implied

otherwise) or prospects, and Acquiror hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing
disclaimer, neither Acquiror nor any other person makes or has made any

representatives with respect to: (i) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget or prospective information relating to Acquiror, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses; or (ii) except for the
representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this Article 4, any oral or
written information presented to the Company or any of its affiliates or
representatives in the course of their due diligence investigation of
Acquiror, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other
person has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty
other than those contained in Article 3.

necessary for the purpose of determining the Companys continued compliance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and preparing for the
integration of Acquiror and the Company following the Effective Time. Acquiror

Representatives attorneys responses to auditors requests for information
regarding the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and such
financial and operating data and other information reasonably requested by
Acquiror (provided, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client privilege).

representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement. This
**Section 5.1(a)** shall not require the disclosure of any information to
Acquiror the disclosure of which, in the Companys reasonable judgment: (i)

Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or threatened litigation or
investigations, if disclosure might affect the confidential nature of, or any
privilege relating to, the matters being discussed. If any of the restrictions

specific

or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other
than portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory or

has provided Acquiror with information sufficient for Acquiror to make an
informed decision with respect to such request, and Acquiror has failed to

to Acquiror of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that: (a) is
reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events
and circumstances known to it, to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the

provisions of this Agreement and unless there has been a Company Adverse
Recommendation, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date the Registration Statement is declared effective, take all action

Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, determines in good faith it is reasonably
likely that to, or to continue to, recommend this Agreement to its
stockholders would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, then the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation or publicly propose or resolve to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation.

 



 

 **Section 5.5** **_Information Provided to Acquiror_**. The Company agrees

filed and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes

false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (b) in the
case of the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, not be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with
respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the meeting in connection with
which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be mailed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall have no responsibility for the truth or accuracy
of any information with respect to Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or any

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall accrue the costs associated
with any payments due under any Company Benefit Plan, including without
limitation any change of control or severance agreements, retention or stay
bonus programs, or other similar arrangements, consistent with GAAP.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** **_Acquisition Proposals_**.

 



 

(a) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any Persons other than Acquiror with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will within two (2) Business Days advise Acquiror
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof
(including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and
will keep Acquiror apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations (including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal) on a reasonably current basis.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents,
advisors and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than contacting a Person for the sole purpose of
seeking clarification of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal); _provided_ that, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal from a Person other than Acquiror after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, and the Company Board concludes in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and, after considering the advice of outside
counsel, that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable law,
the Company may: (i) furnish information with respect to it to such Person
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement (subject to the requirement that any such information not previously
provided to Acquiror shall be promptly furnished to Acquiror); (ii)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; and (iii) terminate this Agreement in order to concurrently enter
into an agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
**Section 5.8** unless and until (x) five (5) Business Days have elapsed
following the delivery to the other party of a written notice of such
determination by the Company Board and, during such five (5) Business-Day
period, the parties cooperate with one another with the intent of enabling the
parties to engage in good faith negotiations so that the Contemplated
Transactions may be effected, and (y) at the end of such five (5) Business-Day
period, the Company continues, in good faith and after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to believe that a Superior
Proposal continues to exist.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 5.9** **_Release of Security Interest_. **Prior to the Effective
Time, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to pay, in full, all
principal and interest payments due on Companys outstanding debt obligation
to First Bank, St. Louis, Missouri, and use its reasonable best efforts to
seek the release of First Banks security interest on the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of the Bank pledged to First Bank in
connection with such debt obligation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 6 
ACQUIRORS COVENANTS**

 



 

 **Section 6.1** **_Access and Investigation_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to any applicable Legal Requirement, Company and its
Representatives shall, at all times during normal business hours and with
reasonable advance notice, have such reasonable access to the facilities,
operations, records and properties of Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.1(a) as shall be necessary
for the purpose of determining Acquirors continued compliance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The Company and its Representatives may,
during such period, make or cause to be made such reasonable investigation of
the operations, records and properties of Acquiror and each of its
Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and legal conditions as the
Company shall deem necessary or advisable to familiarize itself with such
records, properties and other matters; provided, however, that such access or
investigation shall not interfere materially with the normal operations of
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon request, Acquiror and each of its
Subsidiaries will furnish the Company or its Representatives attorneys
responses to auditors requests for information regarding the Company or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, and such financial and operating data and
other information reasonably requested by the Company (provided, such
disclosure would not result in the waiver by Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client privilege). No investigation by
the Company or any of its Representatives shall affect the representations and
warranties made by Acquiror in this Agreement. This Section 6.1(a) shall not
require the disclosure of any information to the Company the disclosure of
which, in Acquirors reasonable judgment: (i) would be prohibited by any
applicable Legal Requirement; (ii) would result in the breach of any agreement
with any third party in effect on the date of this Agreement; or (iii) relate
to pending or threatened litigation or investigations, if disclosure might
affect the confidential nature of, or any privilege relating to, the matters
being discussed. If any of the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall
apply, the Company and Acquiror will make appropriate alternative disclosure
arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with any
applicable Legal Requirement.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Acquiror shall
promptly furnish to the Company: (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal and state banking
laws or federal or state securities laws, which is not generally available on
the SECs EDGAR internet database; and (ii) a copy of each report filed by it
or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other
than portions of such documents

 



      
 

 



 

relating to confidential supervisory or examination materials or the
disclosure of which would violate any applicable Legal Requirement.

 



 

(c) All information obtained by the Company in accordance with this Section
6.1 shall be treated in confidence as provided in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.2** **_Operation of Acquiror and Acquiror Subsidiaries_**.

 



 

(a) Except as Previously Disclosed, as expressly contemplated by or permitted
by this Agreement, as required by applicable Legal Requirement, or with the
prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms, Acquiror shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to: (i) conduct its business in the Ordinary Course of Business
in all material respects; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
and preserve intact its business organization and advantageous business
relationships; and (iii) take no action that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay the ability of
the Company or Acquiror to obtain any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals,
to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement or to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

(b) Except as Previously Disclosed, as expressly contemplated by or permitted
by this Agreement, as required by applicable Legal Requirement, or with the
prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms, Acquiror will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to:

 



 

(i) (A) enter into any agreement with respect to, or consummate, any merger or
business combination, or any acquisition of any other Person or (B) make any
loan, advance or capital contribution to, or investment in, any Person, in
each case that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger;

 



 

(ii) amend the Acquiror Articles of Incorporation or the Acquiror Bylaws, or
similar governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, in a manner that would
materially and adversely affect the benefits of the Merger to the stockholders
of the Company;

 



 

(iii) implement or adopt any change in its accounting principles, practices or
methods, other than as may be required by GAAP or applicable regulatory
accounting requirements; or

 



 

(iv) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of
the Acquiror Board in support of, any of the actions prohibited by this
**Section 6.2**.

 



 

 **Section 6.3** **_Stockholders  Meeting_**. Subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement and unless there has been a Acquiror Adverse
Recommendation, Acquiror shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date the Registration Statement is declared effective,

 



      
 

 



 

take all action necessary, including as required by and in accordance with
NASDAQ Rule 5635(a), the Acquiror Articles of Incorporation and the Acquiror
Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " **Acquiror Stockholders  Meeting**") for the purpose of
obtaining the Acquiror Stockholder Approval. Acquiror and the Acquiror Board
will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the
votes in favor of the Acquiror Stock Issuance required by NASDAQ Rule 5635(a),
including by recommending that its stockholders vote in favor of the Acquiror
Stock Issuance, and Acquiror and the Acquiror Board will not withhold,
withdraw, qualify or adversely modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or adversely modify) such recommendation to
Acquirors stockholders (a " **Acquiror Adverse Recommendation** "). However,
if, prior to the time the Acquiror Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Acquiror Board, after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good
faith it is reasonably likely that to, or to continue to, recommend this
Agreement to its stockholders would result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, then the Acquiror Board may make an Acquiror
Adverse Recommendation or publicly propose or resolve to make an Acquiror
Adverse Recommendation.

 



 

 **Section 6.4** **_Information Provided to the Company_**. Acquiror agrees
that the information concerning Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or to be provided by Acquiror to the Company for inclusion or that is
included in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement and any other
documents to be filed with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions will: (a) at the respective times such documents are
filed and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes
effective and, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, when mailed, not be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (b) in the
case of the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, at the time of the Acquiror Stockholders Meeting, not be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with
respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the meeting in connection with
which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be mailed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Acquiror shall have no responsibility for the truth or accuracy of
any information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their Affiliates contained in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement or in any document submitted to, or other communication with, any
Regulatory Authority.

 



 

 **Section 6.5** **_Operating Functions_.** Acquiror and Acquiror Bank shall
cooperate with the Company and the Bank in connection with planning for the
efficient and orderly combination of the parties and the operation of the Bank
and Acquiror Bank, and in preparing for the consolidation of the banks
appropriate operating functions to be effective on the Effective Date or such
later date as the parties may mutually agree.

 



 

 **Section 6.6** **_Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each
current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
Company Benefit Plans or any Person who is or

 



      
 

 



 

was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, trustee or employee of another Person (each, an "
**Indemnified Party** "), and any Person who becomes an Indemnified Party
between the date hereof and the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Contemplated Transactions,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Acquiror
shall also advance expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in each such case
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject to the receipt of
an undertaking from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if
it is determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification
hereunder.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time or, if such term
coverage is not available, such other maximum period of coverage available,
Acquiror shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event
shall Acquiror be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in
excess of 250% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for
the current policy term for such purpose and, if Acquiror is unable to
maintain such policy (or substitute policy) as a result of this proviso,
Acquiror shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available and for as
long a period of time as is available following the Effective Time by payment
of such amount; _provided further_ , that: (i) Acquiror may substitute
therefor "tail" policies the material terms of which, including coverage and
amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and
officers than the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; or (ii)
the Company may obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the
Companys existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time).

 



 

(c) If Acquiror or any of its successors or assigns shall: (i) consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person;
then, and in each such case, Acquiror shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successor and assign of Acquiror assumes the obligations set forth
in this **Section 6.6**.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this **Section 6.6** shall survive consummation of the
Merger and the Bank Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
legal representatives.

 



 

 **Section 6.7** **_Board Representation_.** Subject to any necessary
approval by the appropriate Regulatory Authorities, Acquiror shall take all
appropriate action, subject to and in accordance with the respective bylaws of
Acquiror and Acquiror Bank, to appoint: (a) one individual serving on the
Company Board and mutually agreeable to the parties, to the Acquiror Board,
effective immediately upon the Effective Time; and (b) one individual serving
on the board of directors of the Bank and mutually agreeable to the parties,
to the board of directors of Acquiror Bank, effective immediately upon the
effectiveness of the Bank Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 6.8** **_Authorization and Reservation of Acquiror Common
Stock_**. The Acquiror Board shall, as of the date hereof, authorize and
reserve the maximum number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to this Agreement and take all other necessary corporate action to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 6.9** **_Stock Exchange Listing_.** Acquiror shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause all shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable
or to be reserved for issuance under this Agreement to be approved for listing
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

 **Section 6.10** **_Assumption of Debt Instruments_.** Except as provided in
**Section 5.9**, Acquiror agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Entity, at or prior
to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and
other instruments required for the due assumption of the Companys outstanding
debt, subordinated debentures, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to
the extent required by the terms of such debt, subordinated debentures,
guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF ALL PARTIES**

 



 

 **Section 7.1** **_Regulatory Approvals_.** Acquiror and the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use all reasonable best
efforts to as promptly as possible prepare, file, effect and obtain all
Requisite Regulatory Approvals, and the parties will comply with the terms of
such Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Each of Acquiror and the Company will
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Legal Requirements
relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all substantive
written information submitted to any Regulatory Authority in connection with
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party
agrees that it will consult with the other party with respect to obtaining all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Regulatory Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, and each
party will keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters
relating to completion of the Contemplated Transactions. Acquiror and the
Company will, upon request, furnish the other party with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other
party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any Regulatory Authority in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 7.2** **_SEC Registration_.** As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company and Acquiror shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and Acquiror shall prepare and file with the
SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be
included. Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders, and Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Acquirors stockholders, in each case as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Acquiror shall also take any action required to be
taken under any applicable Legal Requirement in connection with the Acquiror
Stock Issuance, and each party shall furnish all information concerning itself
and its stockholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action. Acquiror will advise the Company, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Acquiror Capital Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC to amend the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information, and the Company will advise
Acquiror, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC
to amend the Joint Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information. The parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of the other party) as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. If
prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Company,
Acquiror or any Subsidiary of the Company or Acquiror, respectively, or any
change occurs with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company or Acquiror, respectively, for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement that, in each case, is required to be described
in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement, the Company or Acquiror, as applicable, shall promptly
notify the other of such event, and the Company or, Acquiror, as applicable,
shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment
or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and,
as required by applicable Legal Requirements, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to the Companys stockholders and to
Acquirors stockholders.

 



 

 **Section 7.3** **_Publicity_.** Neither the Company nor Acquiror shall, and
neither the Company nor Acquiror shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement or,
except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of
nonpublic information to a third party, concerning, the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of Acquiror, in the case of a proposed announcement,
statement or disclosure by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a
proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by Acquiror; _provided,
however_ , that either party may, without the prior consent of the other party
(but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable
under the circumstances), issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements or by the NASDAQ Rules.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** **_Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_**. Each of Acquiror
and the Company agrees to exercise good faith and use its reasonable best
efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing in this
Agreement, and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as
practicable. Neither Acquiror nor the Company will intentionally take or
intentionally permit to be taken any action that would be a breach of the
terms or

 



      
 

 



 

provisions of this Agreement. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, each of Acquiror and the Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary of Acquiror and the Company, respectively, and all of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate with respect to all
filings that any party is required by any applicable Legal Requirements to
make in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. Subject to applicable
Legal Requirements and the instructions of any Regulatory Authority, each
party shall keep the other party reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Contemplated Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other party with copies of notices or other written
communications received by it or any of its Subsidiaries from any Regulatory
Authority with respect to such transactions.

 



 

 **Section 7.5** **_Tax Free Reorganization_**.

 



 

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a nontaxable reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Code and that
this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code.
From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each
of the Company and Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the
Effective Time, neither Acquiror nor any Affiliate of Acquiror knowingly shall
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason: (i) why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and counsel to
Acquiror, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in **Sections 8.8**
and **9.8** , certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published
advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and
modifications thereto (the " **IRS Guidelines** "), to enable counsel to
Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal opinions contemplated
by **Sections 8.8** and **9.8** , respectively, and the Company hereby agrees
to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or
(ii) why counsel to the Company would not be able to deliver the opinion
required by **Section 9.8**. The Company will deliver such certificates to
counsel to the Company and counsel to Acquiror.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, Acquiror does not know of any reason: (i) why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the
Company, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in **Sections 8.8** and
**9.8** , certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, to
enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal
opinions contemplated by **Sections 8.8** and **9.8** , respectively, and
Acquiror hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date
of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to Acquiror would not be able to deliver
the opinion required by **Section 8.8**. Acquiror will deliver such
certificates to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 7.6** **_Employees and Employee Benefits._**

 



 

(a) All individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (" **Covered Employees** ") shall
automatically become employees of Acquiror as of the Closing. Following the
Closing, Acquiror shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of
Acquiror under the Acquiror Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i)
in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any
closed or frozen Acquiror Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Acquiror
shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans, a
Covered Employees continued participation in Company Benefit Plans shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in the Acquiror Benefit Plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan).

 



 

(b) For all purposes (other than purposes of benefit accruals) under the
Acquiror Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the "
**New Plans** "), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to
credit for such service under any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Covered Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Transition Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

 



 

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Transition Date, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately
prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Transition Date collectively, the " **Old Plans** "); (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar
benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such
Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee,
as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior
to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such
Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into
account under such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred
during the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to
terminate the Companys severance policies immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Subject to

 



      
 

 



 

the provisions of **Section 7.6(e)**, following the Effective Time, Acquiror
or Acquirors Subsidiary will cause any eligible Company employee (exempt and
non-exempt) to be covered by a severance policy under which employees who
incur a qualifying involuntary termination of employment will be eligible to
receive severance pay in accordance with the severance pay schedule set forth
on **Section 7.6(d)** of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Company employee eligible to receive severance benefits
under an employment, change in control, severance or other agreement shall be
entitled to participate in the severance policy described in this **Section
7.6(d)** or to otherwise receive severance benefits.

 



 

(e) Any Company employee who has or is party to any employment agreement,
severance agreement, change in control agreement or any other agreement or
arrangement that provides for any payment that may be triggered by the Merger
or the Bank Merger (the " **CIC Payment** ") shall not receive any severance
benefits as provided in **Section 7.6(d)** but will receive the CIC Payment
to the extent it is required to be paid under such agreement, provided that,
on or before the Closing, the Company will take all steps necessary to ensure
that in the event that the amounts of the CIC Payment, either individually or
in conjunction with a payment or benefit under any other plan, agreement or

by **Section 10.2**, the

 



      
 

 



 

maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable by a
single party under this Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee, and
neither the Company nor Acquiror shall be required to pay the Termination Fee
on more than one occasion. The amounts payable by the Company and Acquiror, as

of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the Company and
Acquiror, as applicable, in the event of a termination of this Agreement
specified in such section.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 11 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 11.1** **_Survival_.** Except for covenants that are expressly to

 **Section 11.3** **_Assignments, Successors and No Third Party Rights_**.
Neither party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights under this
Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and
every representation, warranty, covenant, agreement and provision hereof shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for Section 6.6, nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 11.5
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

 **Section 11.4** **_Modification_.** This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties at any time before or after the Company

approval of the Companys and/or Acquirors stockholders, respectively, any
amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable

the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive compliance with or
amend, modify or supplement any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement which are for the benefit of the waiving party. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Neither the
failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will
operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other
or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. Except as provided in **Article 10**, the
rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not
alternative. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements:

to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a
waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the
other party; (y) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (z) no notice to or
demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.
