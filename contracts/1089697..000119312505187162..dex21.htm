the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter
defined), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").
As soon as practicable at or after the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_

provisions of the DGCL.



1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the

Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.



 

2 ARTICLE II



EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or the holder of
any shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share ("
_Company Common Stock_ "), or capital stock of Merger Sub:



(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding and shall be converted into and shall represent one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so
that, after the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporations common stock. 



(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive $65.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 2.5. All shares of
Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares or by Guarantor,
Parent or Merger Sub or by any Subsidiary of Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.



(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, etc._ In the event of any change in the Company
Common Stock between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time by
reason of any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the
like, the Merger Consideration to be paid for each share of Company Common
Stock as provided in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.



2.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(b), but instead such holder shall be entitled
to payment of the fair value of such shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to
perfect



 

3 or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 shall cease and each of such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.1(b). The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of such a
demand for appraisal and any other instrument delivered to the Company
pursuant to Section 262, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.



2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. The Company agrees that it will take
such actions as are necessary to cause at the Effective Time each option for
the purchase of Company Common Stock (" _Company Stock Option_ ") then
outstanding, whether or not exercisable, under the Companys Amended and
Restated 1998 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, Adjunct Stock
Option Plan, 2000 Stock Option Plan, 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended,
2003 Stock Option Plan and 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), to become fully exercisable (if not then fully exercisable)
and to thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration
upon delivery of an Option Surrender Agreement in accordance with Section
2.5(b)(i)(B): for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the difference between (i) the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock
and (ii) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option to the
extent such difference is a positive number (such amount in cash as described
above being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ ").
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the actions described in the
preceding sentence shall occur at the Effective Time without any action on the
part of Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective stockholders.



2.4 _Treatment of Restricted Company Common Stock_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the restrictions applicable to each share of restricted
Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans shall
immediately lapse, and, at the Effective Time, each share of such Company
Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof.



2.5 _Payment for Securities_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into
an agreement with the Companys transfer agent (or another entity reasonably
acceptable to the Company) to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company
and holders of the Company Stock Options in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger Consideration and the Option
Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company and holders of the
Company Stock Options shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II. On
the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock and Company



 

4 Stock Options, for payment in accordance with this Article II, through the
Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1 and the aggregate Option
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.3 (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1 and the Option Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.3, in each case, out of the Payment Fund. The
Payment Fund shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is
inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Stock Options shall be entitled under Section 2.1 and
Section 2.3, Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the
Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the
Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement,
and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for
payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger
Consideration and the surrender of Company Stock Options for the Option
Consideration.



(b) _Payment Procedures_.



(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
deliver:



(A) to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of: (1) an outstanding
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ "); or (2)
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, and which shall be in a form agreed to by Merger Sub and the
Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor;
and



(B) to each holder of a Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time: (1) an
option surrender agreement (" _Option Surrender Agreement_ ") which shall be
in a form agreed to by Merger Sub and the Company prior to the Closing; and
(2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Company Stock
Option in exchange for the Option Consideration.



(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to



 

5 receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.5(b)(ii), each Certificate and each Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Article II. 



(iii) Upon surrender of a Company Stock Option for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with the Option Surrender Agreement, duly executed, and any
other documents reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, the holder of the Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefore the amount of aggregate Option Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.3, and
the Company Stock Option so surrendered shall be canceled. Any such holder
shall be entitled to receive such Option Consideration by wire transfer, if
so requested by such holder in the Option Surrender Agreement, if the payment
of the aggregate Option Consideration to such holder exceeds $1,000,000. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5(b)(iii),
each Company Stock Option shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Option
Consideration.



(c) _Termination of Rights_.



(i) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on any such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.



(ii) The surrender of a Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option
Consideration shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had
or may have had in respect of such Company Stock Option. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall



 

6 take all action necessary (including causing the Board of Directors of the
Company (or any committees thereof) to take such actions as are allowed by
the Company Stock Plans) to ensure that, following the Effective Time, (A) no
participant in the Company Stock Plans or any other plans, programs or
arrangements of the Company shall have any right thereunder to acquire or
otherwise receive any capital stock of, or other equity or similar interests
in, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate (as such term is
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, as " _Affiliate_ ") thereof and
(B) the Company Stock Options may be surrendered in exchange for the Option
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.



(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders or optionholders of
the Company on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any stockholders or
optionholders of the Company who have not theretofore received the Merger
Consideration or Option Consideration to which they are entitled under this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent
for payment of their claim for such amounts.



(e) _No Liability_. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be
liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Option for any
amount of Merger Consideration or Option Consideration, as applicable,
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any
such Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options at such date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.



(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount of Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.



(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable to any former
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options pursuant to this
Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent
that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of the Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, as applicable, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

agreeing to become party to such contract, and provided further that if Parent

representatives or those of any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly,
to initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing
information) any invitation or submission of any inquiries, proposals or
offers or any other efforts or attempts that constitute, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined) from
any person or engage in any negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise
cooperate with, or assist or participate in, or facilitate or enter into any
such proposal. 



 

29 (b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than
48 hours after receipt thereof), advise Parent of any Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry received by the Company that it reasonably believes could lead to
an Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, any Acquisition

more favorable to such third party in all material respects than, the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and containing additional
provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of
this Section 4.2) and (C) concurrently with or promptly following furnishing
any material nonpublic information to such third party, it furnishes such
material nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously so furnished to Parent); and (ii) engage
in discussions and negotiations with the third party with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal, provided that prior to entering into negotiations with
such third party, it gives Parent written notice of its intention to
enter into negotiations with such third party and furnishes to Parent all
other information regarding such Acquisition Proposal as provided under this
Section 4.2(b).



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys
Board of Directors shall be permitted, at any time prior to approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company as herein
provided, (i) other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, to withdraw,
modify or change, or propose to withdraw, modify or change, the recommendation
by the Board of Directors of this Agreement if, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of Directors concludes in good
faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law; or (ii)
in response to an Acquisition Proposal, to approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal and, in connection therewith,
to withdraw, modify or change the recommendation by the Board of Directors of
this Agreement, but only if, in the case referred to in clause (ii), the Board
of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company has observed the
notice provisions of Section 7.1(d)(ii) and has complied with the provisions
of this Section 4.2. Any action pursuant to this Section 4.2(c) shall not
constitute a breach of the Companys representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement.



 

30 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent required
by applicable law.



(e) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
negotiation with any parties conducted heretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their representatives with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal existing on the date of this Agreement. In addition, the Company
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each third party recipient
of information relating to any such Acquisition Proposal existing on the date
of this Agreement to promptly deliver to the Company or, at the option of the
Company, to destroy all written (and electronic) material furnished to such
third party or its representatives by or on behalf of the Company.



(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings: (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean written
inquiry, offer or proposal relating to any transaction or series of related
transactions involving: (A) any purchase from the Company or acquisition by
any person, entity or "Group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a fifteen percent
(15%) interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person, entity or Group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company, (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business),
exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business),
acquisition or disposition of more than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) any liquidation or
dissolution of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) " _Superior
Proposal_ " shall mean an Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the
voting power of the Companys then outstanding securities or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, that the Board of Directors of the Company has in good faith
concluded (following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel and
its financial adviser), taking into account, among other things, the form of
the consideration offered, the person, entity or Group making the offer, all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the
person, entity or Group making the proposal, to be more favorable to the
Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of
the Merger and is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms
proposed.

file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall furnish such preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent for

31 and that such filing shall be subject to Parents prior approval of the
preliminary Proxy Statement, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall notify Parent of
the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to Parent promptly copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any representative of the Company and
the SEC. As promptly as reasonably practicable after comments are received
from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the
SEC. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review
all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement and all responses to
requests for additional information and replies to comments of the SEC prior
to their being filed with or sent to the SEC, and the filing of such shall be
subject to Parents prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with such
information as may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement or as
may be reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC. After all the
comments received from the SEC, if any, have been cleared by the SEC staff and
all information required to be contained in the Proxy Statement has been
included therein by the Company, the Company shall file the definitive Proxy
Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders of record, as of the record date established by the Board of
Directors of the Company, as promptly as practicable thereafter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1(d) and the Company has complied with Section 7.3(b), the
Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this Section
5.1.



(b) If prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined
in Section 6.1(a)) any event occurs with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied
by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement which is required to be
described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the
Companys stockholders.

Parent and its representatives (including accountants and counsel) reasonable
access, in each case, only at such locations and in accordance with
such procedures (including prior notice requirements, the time and duration

32 mutually agreed to between Parent and the Company prior to any such access, to
all properties, books, records, and Tax Returns of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries and all other information with respect to their respective
businesses, together with the opportunity, at the sole cost and expense of
Parent, to make copies of such books, records and other documents and to
discuss the business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries with such
directors, officers and counsel for the Company as Parent may reasonably
request for the purposes of familiarizing itself with the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries. Parent and its representatives shall use their reasonable
best efforts to conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its

and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of
their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
5.2, the Company shall not be required to, or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to Parent or any of
Parents representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an

agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not have access to
personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information that in the Companys good faith opinion is sensitive or the
disclosure of which could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
risk of liability. If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the
preceding two sentences, the Company shall inform Parent as to the general
nature of what is being withheld. In addition, Parent shall not contact any
personnel of the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding the transactions

representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
5.2 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of

respect to information furnished thereunder or hereunder and any other
activities contemplated thereby.

the approval and adoption of this Agreement at the Companys stockholders
meeting and the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that
the Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that the Companys
stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement at the
Companys stockholders meeting except to the extent that the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn or modified its approval
or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger as permitted by Section
4.2(c). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees
that its obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be affected

the Company of any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1(d) and the Company
has complied with Section 7.3(b), the Company shall not be required to call,
convene or hold a stockholders meeting (and may cancel any scheduled
stockholders meeting) to consider the adoption of this Agreement or otherwise

33 5.4 _HSR and Other Approvals_.



(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to applicable
Antitrust Laws, to which Sections 5.4(b) and (c), and not this Section
5.4(a), shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the
parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental
Entities such authorizations, consents, notifications,
certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each
other in the prosecution of, such matters.



(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than ten business days following the date of
this Agreement, the parties shall file, or cause to be filed by their
respective "ultimate parent entities," with the Federal Trade Commission (the
" _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ ") the notifications and other information (if any)
required to be filed under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall fully
cooperate with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is
necessary under the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall keep each other
apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC or the Antitrust Division.
Parent shall take commercially reasonable action to prevent the FTC, Antitrust
Division, or other Governmental Entity, as the case may be, from filing action
with a court or Governmental Entity, which, if the Governmental Entity
prevailed, would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger, including an agreement to (i) sell or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose
of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or
eithers respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminate existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations of the Company or Parent or eithers
respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminate any relevant venture or other
arrangement; or (iv) effectuate any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to
the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with the
FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental Entity) (each a "
_Divestiture Action_ "). In the event any action is threatened or instituted
challenging the Merger as violative of the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act
of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914, as amended, or any other applicable law designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "),
Parent shall take such commercially reasonable action, including any
Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or resolve such
action. Parent shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations
with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate therein. In addition, Parent shall take such action as may be
required by any federal or state court of the United States, in any action
brought by a Governmental Entity or any other person challenging the Merger as
violative of the Antitrust Laws, including any Divestiture Action, in order
to avoid the entry of any permanent injunction or other permanent order which
would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent the consummation of the Merger,
and in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order
is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable



 

34 to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall take promptly any and all commercially reasonable
steps to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit
such consummation prior to the Termination Date.



(c) From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the
required waiting period under the HSR Act, Parent and Merger Sub shall not

5.5 _Employee Matters_.



(a) Parent shall take such action as may be necessary so that on and
after the Effective Time, and for one year thereafter, officers and employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain after the Closing in the employ
of the Company or its Subsidiaries are provided base salary, base wages and
employee benefits, plans and programs (including but not limited to incentive
compensation, deferred compensation, pension, life insurance, welfare, profit
sharing, 401(k), severance, salary continuation and benefits and non-
retirement equity-based compensation arrangements, but excluding for this
purpose stock options or other equity participation programs) which, in the
aggregate, are not materially less favorable than those made available by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such officers and employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time. For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
in benefits plans and programs provided by Parent to such officers and
employees, the officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will be credited with their years of service recognized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any predecessor thereof to the extent services with Parent
and its Subsidiaries and any predecessor thereof is taken into account under
the benefit plans and programs of Parent and its Subsidiaries. The
eligibility of any officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of Parent shall not be
subject to any exclusions for any pre-existing conditions if such individual
has met the participation requirements of similar benefit plans and programs
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All individuals eligible to participate
in any plan or arrangement contemplated above shall be immediately eligible
to participate in the similar plan or arrangement maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (or the same plan or arrangement if still maintained). Amounts
paid before the Effective Time by officers and employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries under any health plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries
shall, after the Effective Time, be taken into account in applying deductible
and out-of-pocket limits applicable under the health plans of Parent provided
as of the Effective Time to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid
under such health plans of Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 5.5(a)
shall create any rights in any officer or employee or former officer or
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation in respect of continued
employment for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever.



(b) Subject to the other provisions set forth in this Section 5.5, after
the Effective Time and subject to applicable law and the terms of any
Employee Benefit Plan, Parent



 

35 may amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan in existence prior to
the Closing. After the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
each of their respective Subsidiaries are and shall remain liable for, and
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be responsible for and shall promptly discharge, all liabilities,
duties and claims (to or by any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
employees or former employees, any beneficiary under any Employee Benefit
Plan, any Governmental Entity or otherwise) arising out of or relating to
the employment relationship between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and their respective employees and former employees, including liabilities,
duties and claims (i) for deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
retirement benefits, health and life benefits, severance arrangements and
benefits, disability benefits and other benefits under any Employee Benefit
Plan, fund, program, arrangement, policy or practice, (ii) relating to
continuation health coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Title
I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA and (iii) for unemployment and workers
compensation or similar benefits. After the Effective Time, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall file
any and all annual reports, filings or notices that may be required in
connection with any Employee Benefit Plan to be filed with Governmental
Entities or provided to participants and beneficiaries after the Closing.



(c) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume,
and perform pursuant to, each of the severance benefit plans described in
_Schedule 5.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for a period equal to the longer of twelve months or any applicable
period set forth in such plans, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors shall not terminate or otherwise amend such plans in a manner
adverse to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries covered by
such plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(d) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, and
perform pursuant to, each of the employment agreements and retention
agreements described on _Schedule 5.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.



(e) No later than twelve business days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver written notice (the " _Termination Notice_ ") to the Company of the
names of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose employment
shall be terminated by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on
the Closing Date.



(f) Prior to the Closing but effective at the Effective Time, the
Company shall take such action as may be required to eliminate the Companys
obligation to match employee contributions with equity under the Companys
401(k) plan.



5.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(a) Without limiting any other rights that any person may have pursuant
to any employment agreement, indemnification agreement or other arrangement,
each as identified on _Schedule 5.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(each, an " _Indemnified Party Agreement_ "), who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, is or was serving (i) as director, officer,  



 

36  employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) as a fiduciary
under any Employee Benefit Plan or (iii) at the request of the Company or
any Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, employee
benefit plan, trust or other enterprise (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "),
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all obligations to
indemnify (including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) such
Indemnified Parties for acts or omissions by such Indemnified Parties
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time), and such indemnification obligations
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with the terms of such Indemnified Party Agreement from the
Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such Indemnified Parties arising out of
such acts or omissions;  _provided_ , _however_ , Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to honor any obligations arising under an
Indemnified Party Agreement entered into by the Company after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims
arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent be
required to maintain such current policies if it is required to pay aggregate
annual premiums for insurance under this Section 5.6(b) in excess of 200% of
the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the most recent
year. The Company hereby represents and warrants that the premiums for such
insurance for such year are set forth on _Schedule 5.6(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. In the event that Parent is required to pay in excess of
such amount, it shall only be obligated to provide a policy with the best
coverage Parent is reasonably able to obtain for such 200% amount.



(c) The Surviving Corporation shall not, and Parent shall not permit the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any Indemnified Party Agreement in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights of any Indemnified Party thereunder.

 



(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.



(e) The provisions of this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties hereto and each Indemnified
Party entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement
pursuant to this Section 5.6, and his heirs and representatives.



 

37 5.7 _Agreement to Defend_. In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation
or other proceeding by any governmental body or other person or other legal
or administrative proceeding is commenced that questions the validity or
legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in
connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond thereto.



5.8 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto will consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
consent of the other party, except as may be required by applicable law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or transaction reporting system so long as the other party is
notified promptly by the disclosing party of such press release or public
statement.



5.9 _Advice of Changes; Governmental Filings_. Subject to compliance with all
applicable laws, the Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall confer on
a regular basis with each other, report on operational matters and shall
promptly advise each other orally and in writing of any change or event

Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. In addition, the Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and the Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of the occurrence or failure to occur of any event which occurrence
or failure to occur cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.2(a), 6.2(b), 6.2(c) and 6.2(d), _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide each other
(or their respective counsel) copies of all filings made by such party or its
Subsidiaries with any state or federal Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp
Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (ii) cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of
all applications or other documents regarding any applicable exemptions to any
such Tax or fee; and (iii) each pay any such Tax or fee which becomes payable
by it on or before the due date therefor.



5.11 _Investigation and Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub; No Other
Representations or Warranties_.



(a) Each of Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it
has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon,
has formed an independent judgment concerning, the Company and its

Merger Sub have requested such documents and information from the Company as

was based and which is covered by the representations and warranties in
Section 3.1(r)); and (iv) except as set forth in the parenthetical in clause
(iii), Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub will not (and will cause all of their
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates or any other person acting

accountants, investment bankers or representatives with respect thereto, or
hold any such person liable with respect thereto.

or Affiliates with respect to:

 



(i) any projections, forecasts, reserve or other estimates, plans or budgets
of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or
any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of

Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or Merger Subs

8.4 _Rules of Construction_. __



(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by
independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that
have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the
same with consent and upon the advice of said independent counsel. Each party
and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
exchanged between the parties shall be deemed the work product of the parties
and may not be construed against any party by reason of its preparation.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that
drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.



(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such
information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule,
as applicable, that such information is required to be listed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or
that such items are material to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case
may be. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule are inserted for
convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a
part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure
Schedule are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in Section
3.1 and Section 3.2 merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in
one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule
as an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed
adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations
or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such
item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule with respect to
such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference
thereto.



 

46 (c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed
to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or
items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the
parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not
described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement.



(d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules,
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the
corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other
subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles
appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other
subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any
part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall
be disregarded in construing the language contained therein. The words "this
Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar
import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Section," "this
subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or
subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "including" (in its
various forms) means "including, without limitation." Pronouns in masculine,
feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include any other
gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the
singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless
the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include the singular and
plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined terms.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to a specific time shall
refer to Houston, Texas time.



8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. __



8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other
documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The provisions
of Sections 5.5 and 5.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the persons referred to therein and their respective heirs and
representatives. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence,
this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. __



 

8.7 _Governing Law; Agreement to Arbitrate_. This Agreement shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Any disputes
arising out of or relating to this Agreement,



 

47 or the alleged breach hereof, or in any way relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement or the relationship between the parties created by this
Agreement (hereafter a " _Dispute_ ") shall be finally resolved by three
arbitrators in a binding arbitration administered by the International Centre
for Dispute Resolution (" _ICDR_ ") of the American Arbitration Association
(" _AAA_ ") under its International Arbitration Rules (the " _Rules_ ") then
in force. The parties shall each appoint one arbitrator within 20 days of
receipt of a notice to arbitrate a Dispute, and within 20 days of the
nomination of the second arbitrator the two arbitrators appointed by the
parties shall together appoint by mutual agreement the third arbitrator, who
shall be the presiding arbitrator. If any appointment is not made within the
time allotted by the Rules, then the ICDR shall appoint the arbitrator
according to the Rules. The seat of the arbitration shall be Houston, Texas.
The arbitration shall be conducted solely in the English language and the
award rendered solely in U.S. dollars. If a party refuses to honor its
obligations to arbitrate under this Section 8.7, the other party may obtain
appropriate relief compelling arbitration in any court having jurisdiction
over the refusing party; the order compelling arbitration shall require that
the arbitration proceedings take place in Houston, Texas and in the manner
specified herein. For purposes of the preceding sentence, each party hereby
expressly submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state courts
in Harris County of the State of Texas or the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, and expressly waives any
claim of improper venue and any claim that such courts are an inconvenient
forum. Each party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of process of any
of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or proceeding by the
providing of notice in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3. Any
award of the arbitrators pursuant to the foregoing may be enforced in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Dispute
relating to whether the Company properly terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) shall be brought in and resolved by the state courts of
Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware; the
arbitrators shall have no authority to decide such Dispute; for such purpose
each party hereby expressly submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of
such courts and expressly waives any claim of improper venue and any claim
that such courts are an inconvenient forum; and each party further hereby
irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of the aforementioned
courts in any such suit, action or proceeding by the providing of notice in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3. Each party irrevocably
stipulates that this Section 8.7 shall satisfy the requirements for an
agreement in writing pursuant to Article II of the United Nations Convention
on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New
York on June 10, 1958.



8.8 _No Remedy in Certain Circumstances_. Each party agrees that, should any
court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or
part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any
action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or
the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this
Agreement shall terminate. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement,
to the extent that a party hereto took an action inconsistent herewith or
failed to take action consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to an
order or judgment of a court or other competent authority, such party shall
not incur any liability or obligation unless such party breached its
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement or did not in good faith seek
to resist or object to the imposition or entering of such order or judgment.



 

48 8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights of Parent and Merger
Sub hereunder may be assigned prior to the Closing, in whole or in part,
without the consent of the Company, to one or more Affiliates or Subsidiaries
of Parent or Merger Sub if: (i) the assignee shall assume in writing all of
such assignors obligations to Seller hereunder; (ii) Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not be released from any of their respective obligations
hereunder by reason of such assignment; and (iii) such assignment does not
hinder or delay the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and does not otherwise adversely affect the
Company or its stockholders from a tax or other perspective. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. __



8.10 _Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein referred to as a "
_Company Affiliate_ ": (i) any direct or indirect holder of equity interests
or securities in the Company (whether limited or general partners, members,
stockholders or otherwise); and (ii) any director, officer, employee,
representative or agent of (A) the Company or (B) any person who controls the
Company. No Company Affiliate shall have any liability or obligation to
Parent or Merger Sub of any nature whatsoever in connection with or under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and Parent and
Merger Sub hereby waive and release all claims of any such liability
and obligation. __



8.11 _Schedule Definitions_. All capitalized terms in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall have the meanings ascribed to them herein, unless the context
otherwise requires or as otherwise defined. __



8.12 _Joint Liability_. Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed a
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent and Merger Sub
jointly and all liability and obligations relating thereto shall be deemed a

8.13 _Guaranty_. Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as if it were
the primary obligor, the punctual: (i) payment by Parent of the Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration and the other amounts payable by
Parent pursuant to Article II and any damages that may be due to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for failure to close the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and (ii) performance of the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub (including any of their permitted assignees) set forth herein.
Additionally, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time
(except to the extent such representations and warranties speak expressly as
of an earlier date), Guarantor adopts and republishes to the Company, _mutadis
mutandis_ , the representations and warranties set forth in Article III. __

EXECUTION VERSION



STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT



 

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT, dated as of September 18, 2005 (this " _Agreement_
"), among Warburg Pincus Ventures, L.P. (" _Warburg_ "), Roger L. Jarvis ("
_Jarvis_ ", and together with Warburg, the " _Stockholders_ "), and Norsk
Hydro EandP Americas, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Parent_ "). 



WHEREAS, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have
the respective meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of the date hereof, by and among
Parents ultimate parent corporation (" _Guarantor_ "), Parent, a Delaware
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Spinnaker Exploration Company, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ");



WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholders collectively own of
record, own beneficially, or otherwise have voting control over shares of
capital stock of the Company, as set forth on Schedule I hereto (such shares,
or any other voting or equity of securities of the Company hereafter acquired
by any Stockholder prior to the termination of this Agreement, being referred
to herein collectively as the " _Shares_ ");



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Guarantor, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company are entering into the Merger Agreement,
pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will be
the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ "); and



WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that the
Stockholders agree, and in order to induce Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders are willing to enter into
this Agreement; 



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereby agree, severally and not jointly, as follows:



1\. _Voting of Shares_.



(a) Each Stockholder covenants and agrees that until the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or any other meeting of the stockholders of the Company,
however called, such Stockholder will vote, or cause to be voted, all of its
respective Shares: (i) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and
approval of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as the Merger
Agreement may be modified or amended from time to time in a manner not
economically adverse to the Stockholders; (ii) against any action or agreement
that would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant or any
other obligations or agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement or in
a breach in any material respect of any representation or warranty of the
Company in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) against any Acquisition Proposal. 



 

A-1 (b) Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Parent, and
any individual designated in writing by Parent, and each of them
individually, as its proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of
substitution), for and in its name, place and stead, to vote its Shares at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to any of the
matters specified in, and in accordance and consistent with, this Section 1.
Each Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the
Merger Agreement in reliance upon the Stockholders execution and delivery
of this Agreement. Each Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy
set forth in this Section 1(b) is given in connection with the execution of
the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the
performance of the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. Except as
otherwise provided for herein, each Stockholder hereby: (i) affirms that the
irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and may under no circumstances
be revoked by such Stockholder; (ii) ratifies and confirms all that the
proxies appointed hereunder may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue
hereof; and (iii) affirms that such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended
to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 212(e) of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the irrevocable
proxy granted hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the termination of
this Agreement.



2\. _Transfer of Shares_. Each Stockholder covenants and agrees that
such Stockholder will not directly or indirectly: (a) sell, assign, transfer
(including by merger or otherwise by operation of law), pledge, encumber or
otherwise dispose of any of the Shares; (b) deposit any of the Shares into a
voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to
the Shares or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto which
is inconsistent with this Agreement; or (c) enter into any contract, option or
other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect sale,
assignment, transfer (including by merger or otherwise by operation of law) or
other disposition of any Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Stockholder
may transfer such Shares (i) solely for estate planning purposes (provided,
that the transferee agrees in writing in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent to be bound by this Agreement as a Stockholder), (ii) to a
Stockholders beneficial owners as a distribution of such Shares with respect
to such beneficial ownership interest (provided, that the transferee(s) agrees
in writing in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent to be bound by this
Agreement as a Stockholder) or (iii) that does not exceed 5% of
such Stockholders Shares.



3\. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholders_. Each Stockholder on
its own behalf hereby severally represents and warrants to Parent with respect
to itself and its ownership of the Shares as follows:



(a) _Ownership of Shares_. The Stockholder beneficially owns all of
the Shares as set forth on Schedule I hereto and has good and marketable
title to such Shares, free and clear of any claims, liens, encumbrances and
security interests whatsoever. The Stockholder owns no Shares of Company
Common Stock other than the Shares as set forth on Schedule I hereto. The
Stockholder has the power to authorize the voting of the Shares as
contemplated hereby, without restriction, with respect to all of the Shares.



(b) _Power, Binding Agreement_. The Stockholder has the legal capacity and
all requisite power and authority to enter into and perform all of its
obligations, under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the



 

A-2 Stockholder and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder,
enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject as
to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights
and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



(c) _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict
with or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material
benefit under, any provision of any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, or other agreement, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Stockholder, the Shares or any
of the Stockholders properties or assets. Except that certain Amended and
Restated Stockholders Agreement dated as of September 27, 1999 or as expressly
contemplated hereby, and other than requirements that the Stockholders dispose
of their Shares in a pro rata manner, the Stockholder is not a party to, and
the Shares are not subject to or bound in any manner by, any contract or
agreement relating to the Shares, including without limitation, any voting
agreement, option agreement, purchase agreement, stockholders agreement,
partnership agreement or voting trust. Except for informational filings with
the SEC, no consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission or
other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic, foreign or
supranational, is required by or with respect to the Stockholder in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by
the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(d)  _Brokers or Finders_. Except as contemplated by Section 3.1(u) of the
Merger Agreement, no agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other firm or Person retained by the Stockholder or the Company is or will be
entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any other similar commission or
fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



4\. _Representations and Warranties of Parent_. Parent represents and warrants
to the Stockholders as follows:



(a) _Authority_. Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent, and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Stockholders,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to
or affecting creditors rights and to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).



(b) _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict
with or result in any



 

A-3 violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, any provision of any
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, or other
agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment,
order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to
Parent or any of the Parents properties or assets. Except for informational
filings with the SEC, no consent, approval, order or authorization of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency
or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic,
foreign or supranational, is required by or with respect to Parent in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(c) _Financing_. At the Closing, Parent shall have sufficient immediately
available funds to enable it to pay the Merger Consideration and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.



5\. _No Solicitation_. Prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, each Stockholder agrees, in its individual capacity
as a stockholder of the Company, that it will not, and will not: (a) authorize
or (to the extent within its control) permit any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, Affiliates and other representatives or those of any of its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to initiate, solicit or encourage
(including by way of providing information) any invitation or submission of
any inquiries, proposals or offers or any other efforts or attempts that
constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal
from any person or engage in any negotiations with respect thereto or
otherwise cooperate with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or enter
into any such proposal directly or indirectly; or (b) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall prohibit any Stockholder from engaging in any of such activities with
any person with whom the Company is entitled to engage in discussions and
negotiations pursuant to Section 4.2(c) of the Merger Agreement.



6\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur
of: (a) the Effective Time; or (b) any termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof; _provided_ , _however_ that no such
termination shall relieve any party of liability for a breach hereof prior
to termination, and any such termination will not affect any rights hereunder
which by their terms do not terminate or expire prior to or at such
termination.



7\. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, without the necessity of posting a
bond, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.



8\. _Fiduciary Duties_. Each Stockholder is signing this Agreement solely in
such Stockholders capacity as an owner of its respective Shares, and nothing
herein shall prohibit, prevent or preclude such Stockholder or its designee
from taking or not taking any action in its capacity as an officer or director
of the Company, to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement.



 

A-4 9\. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights_. Each Stockholder, severally and not jointly,
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees to prevent the
exercise of, any rights of appraisal, any dissenters rights and any similar
rights relating to the Merger that such Stockholder may directly or indirectly
have by virtue of the ownership of any Shares.



10\. _Miscellaneous_.



(a) _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.



(b)  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the terms of this Agreement remain as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

CONSULTING AGREEMENT



CONSULTING AGREEMENT (" _Agreement_ "), dated as of September 18, 2005, shall
become effective as of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined), by and
between, Harald Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "),
and Roger L. Jarvis, an individual resident in the State of Texas ("
_Consultant_ ").



WHEREAS, Merger Sub, Norsk Hydro ASA, a public limited liability
company organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway and the ultimate
parent of Merger Sub, Norsk Hydro EandP Americas, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership and the immediate parent of Merger Sub, and Consultants current
employer, Spinnaker Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), are simultaneously entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(" _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ ") and the Company shall continue its existence
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the Company is sometimes referred
to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ");



WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, it is contemplated that Consultant
will desire to retire from his status as an executive officer of the Company,
and the Surviving Corporation will desire to continue to draw on Consultants
experience and knowledge by entering into a consulting relationship with
Consultant upon the terms and conditions hereinafter contained;



WHEREAS, following the Merger, it is contemplated that Consultant will desire
to enter into a consulting relationship with the Surviving Corporation upon
the terms and conditions hereinafter contained; and



WHEREAS, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have
the respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement;



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agreements herein set
forth and of the mutual benefits accruing to Merger Sub and to Consultant from
the consulting relationship to be established between the parties by the terms
of this Agreement, Merger Sub and Consultant agree as follows:



1\. _Effective Date_. This Agreement shall become effective simultaneously
with the effectiveness of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the
date of the effectiveness of the Merger being hereinafter called the "
_Effective Date_ ").



2\. _Cessation of Employment; Consulting Relationship_. Upon consummation of
the Merger, Consultant and the Surviving Corporation have agreed that: (i)
Consultants continued employment with the Company, as detailed in his
employment agreement dated December 20, 1996, will be terminated; and (ii)
that, regardless of anything to the contrary contained therein, as a result
of the consummation of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to
executive 100% of the rights and benefits to which Consultant is or may become
entitled to under the Companys (A) Executive Change in Control Severance
Plan and (B) plans to accelerate the year-end incentive compensation and base
compensation adjustments as contemplated by



 

B-1 Schedule 4.1(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. On the Effective Date, the
Surviving Corporation hereby retains Consultant, and Consultant hereby agrees
to be retained by the Surviving Corporation, as an independent consultant, and
not as an employee.



3\. _Term_. The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and
shall continue for twelve (12) months (such period being hereinafter called
the " _Term_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, this Agreement shall terminate
immediately upon the date of Consultants death.



 

4\. _Consulting Services_. Consultant agrees that during the Term of this
Agreement:



(a) Consultant shall assist and advise the Surviving Corporation with respect
to: (i) the integration of its continuing business with the oil and gas
exploration and production business of the Guarantor and its Affiliates, (ii)
the retention of employees of the Company following the consummation of the
Merger and the integration of such employees with employees of the Guarantor
and its Affiliates engaged in the oil and gas exploration and production
business; (iii) assisting and advising the Guarantor and its Affiliates with
respect to the strategic aspects of the operations of the Surviving
Corporation and the oil and gas exploration and production business of the
Guarantor and its Affiliates; and (iv) such other matters as reasonably
requested by the Surviving Corporation, and as are consistent with the nature
of the duties performed by Consultant during his active service with the
Company;



(b) Consultant shall coordinate the rendition of his services hereunder with
Tore Torvund or his successor;



(c) Consultant shall be available to render services to the Surviving
Corporation under this Agreement for not more than eighty (80) hours during
any month during the first three (3) months of the Term and not more than
forty (40) hours during any month during the remainder of the Term; and



(d) During the first six (6) months of the Term, Consultant shall render his
services under this Agreement primarily at the executive offices of the
Surviving Corporation in Houston, Texas. Thereafter, Consultant shall have
sole discretion to determine the location from which he will provide the
services required under this Agreement during the remaining Term, and in no
event shall he be required to relocate, or render services from, the principal
offices of the Surviving Corporation.



5\. _Compensation_. The Surviving Corporation agrees to pay Consultant for
his services performed under this Agreement at the rate of $15,000 for each
month during the Term, whether or not services are actually rendered hereunder
payable on the first day of each such month.



6\. _Expense Reimbursement_. The Surviving Corporation agrees to reimburse
consultant for all travel and other costs and expenses reasonably incurred by
Consultant in the performance of his duties hereunder. The Surviving
Corporation shall timely reimburse Consultant for all such expenses submitted
with reasonable documentation in a manner consistent with the travel and
expense policies generally applicable to the Surviving Corporations officers.



 

B-2 7\. _Benefits_. Except as made available by virtue of prior employment
arrangements with the Company or in connection with the Merger or as set
forth below, Consultant shall not be entitled to participate in or receive
benefits under any programs maintained for employees of the Surviving
Corporation, including, without limitation, life, disability benefits,
healthcare, pension, bonuses not contemplated herein, profit sharing or other
retirement plans or other fringe benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
beginning on the Effective Date and continuing until the earlier of the date
of Consultants death or attainment of age 65 (or such later age as may be
applicable to the most senior retired executives of the Surviving Corporation)
Consultant will be provided, at the expense of the Surviving Corporation, with
medical, dental and other healthcare benefits not less favorable to
Consultant than those available to him immediately prior to the Effective
Date. In the event that the Consultant is not eligible to participate in one
or more healthcare plans of the Surviving Corporation providing such
coverage, the Surviving Corporation will reimburse Consultant for the cost of
Consultant purchasing equivalent healthcare coverage, with such amount grossed
up so that the net amount received by Consultant after the payment of income
taxes on such payment (calculated at the maximum federal, state and local
income tax rates applicable to individuals residing in Houston, Texas) will be
not less than the cost of such healthcare coverage. The Surviving Corporation
agrees to provide to the Consultant such information relating to the
healthcare benefits made available to the senior executive officers of the
Surviving Corporation as Consultant may reasonably request from time to time.



8\. _Support, Supplies and Office Space_. The Surviving Corporation
will provide the Consultant with suitable administrative support (as
reasonably determined by Consultant and the Surviving Corporation) during the
Term including, among other things, secretarial support, photocopying and
facsimile services, voice mail access, remote e-mail access (including
provision of a Blackberry or equivalent equipment), message taking services,
mail receipt, office furniture, utilities, office equipment, and office
supplies and parking. During the first six (6) months of the term and for so
long thereafter as Consultant is available to render services from the
Surviving Corporations principal executive offices in Houston, Texas, the
offices, administrative support and parking will be consistent with that
made available to the Consultant by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Date.



9\. _Confidential Information_.



(a) _Confidential Information_.



(i) Consultant recognizes that by reason of his prior service to the Company
and his engagement with the Surviving Corporation hereunder, he has acquired
in the past and will acquire in the future Confidential Information (defined
below), the use or disclosure of which would cause Guarantor (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) and the Surviving Corporation substantial loss and
damages which could not be readily calculated and for which no remedy at law
would be adequate. Accordingly, Consultant agrees that he will not (directly
or indirectly) at any time, whether during or after his engagement hereunder,
disclose any such Confidential Information to any person except: (i) in the
performance of his services to the Surviving Corporation hereunder; (ii) as
required by applicable law; (iii) in connection with the enforcement of his
rights under this Agreement; (iv) in connection with any disagreement, dispute
or



 

B-3 litigation between Consultant and the Surviving Corporation; or (v) with the
prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation. As used herein, "
_Confidential Information_ " means: (A) all seismic and geophysical data,
geological data, chemical data, engineering data, interpretive and analytical
reports and studies, logs, formation tests, maps, diagrams, data bases,
computer printouts, computer tapes, agreements and contracts, files, books,
accounts, and other technical information, business records, or financial data
owned or otherwise acquired by the Surviving Corporation or prepared by
Consultant or any officer, employee, consultant, contractor, agent, or
representative of the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of the Surviving
Corporation prior to or during the term of this Agreement; and (B) any
information received by Consultant in connection with his prior employment as
chief executive officer of the Company or his engagement hereunder with the
Surviving Corporation to the extent the disclosure of such information by
Consultant would result in a breach by the Surviving Corporation of any
confidentiality obligation known to Consultant; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such term shall not include any information that (1) is or becomes generally
known or available other than as a result of a disclosure by Consultant or
(2) is or becomes known or available to Consultant on a nonconfidential basis
from a source (other than the Surviving Corporation) which, to Consultants
knowledge, is not prohibited from disclosing such information to Consultant
by a legal, contractual, fiduciary or other obligation to the Surviving
Corporation. In no event will any information be deemed Confidential
Information after two (2) years following the expiration of the Term.

 



(ii) Consultant confirms that all Confidential Information is the exclusive
property of the Surviving Corporation or the Guarantor, as the case may be.
All business records, papers or documents kept or made by Consultant while
engaged hereunder relating to the business of the Surviving Corporation and
the Guarantor shall be and remain the property of the Surviving Corporation or
the Guarantor, as the case may be, at all times. Upon the request of the
Surviving Corporation or the Guarantor, as the case may be, at any
time, Consultant shall promptly deliver to the Surviving Corporation or the
Guarantor, as appropriate, and shall retain no copies of, any written
materials, records and documents made by Consultant or coming into his
possession while retained hereunder concerning the business or affairs of the
Surviving Corporation or the Guarantor, other than personal materials, records
and documents (including notes and correspondence) of Consultant not
containing Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Consultant shall be permitted to retain copies (including electronic copies)
of, or have access to, all such materials, records and documents relating to
any disagreement, dispute or litigation between Consultant and the
Surviving Corporation or any third person.



(b) _Assistance by Consultant_. Both during the period of Consultants
engagement by the Surviving Corporation and thereafter, provided the Surviving
Corporation pays all costs and expenses, Consultant shall assist the Surviving
Corporation and the Guarantor, at any time, in the protection of its
respective worldwide right, title, and interest in and to Confidential
Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such assistance after
termination of Consultants employment does not, in Consultants good faith
judgment, unreasonably interfere with Consultants other activities.



 

B-4 10\. _Non-Disparagement_. The Surviving Corporation agrees that it will not
make any statements to third parties which are intended to disparage,
discredit or injure the reputation of Consultant. Consultant agrees that he
will not make any statements to third parties which are intended to disparage,
discredit or injure the reputation of the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates. __



11.  _Agreement Not to Compete_.



(a) _Term_. Until twelve (12) months after the last day of the Term of this
Agreement, Consultant shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) engage in, have
any equity interest in, or manage or operate any business that competes with
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates anywhere in the world, or
(ii) hire or recruit or otherwise solicit or induce any non-clerical employee,
director, or consultant of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
to terminate its employment or arrangement with the Surviving Corporation or
such Affiliate.



(b)  _Definition_. For the purposes of this Section 11, "any business that
competes with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates" does not
include: (i) any type of activity other than the oil and gas exploration and
production business in which the Surviving Corporation actively engages on
the date of this Agreement in the offshore Gulf of Mexico area; or (ii) the
ownership as a passive investor of less than 5% of the voting securities of a
person whose securities are publicly traded in a recognized securities market
in the United States or elsewhere.



12\. _Remedies_. Consultant acknowledges that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach of Sections 9, 10 or 11 by Consultant, and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of such
Sections by specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such
breach or any threatened breach, without the necessity of posting any bond.
Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of
such Sections, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or
in equity to the Surviving Corporation, including the recovery of damages from
Consultant and his agents involved in such breach and remedies available to
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to other agreements with Consultant.



13.  _General_.



(a) _Amendment_. This Agreement may only be amended by written agreement
between the Consultant and the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Assignability_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights of the Surviving Corporation
hereunder may be assigned prior to the Effective Date, in whole or in part,
without the consent of the Consultant, to one or more Affiliates
or Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation if: (i) the assignee shall
assume in writing all of the Surviving Corporations obligations to Seller
hereunder; (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be released



 

B-5 from any of its obligations hereunder by reason of such assignment; and (iii)
Consultants services hereunder shall continue to be for the benefit of any
surviving or successor corporation. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.



(c) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the terms of this Agreement remain as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



(d) _Applicable Law_. The rights and liabilities of the parties hereto shall
be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. The parties
hereto submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Texas sitting in Harris
County, Texas in respect of any matter or thing arising out of this Agreement
or pursuant thereto.



(e) _Taxes and Statutory Obligations_. As an independent
contractor, Consultant will be solely responsible for all taxes,
withholdings, and other similar statutory obligations, including, but not
limited to, Workers Compensation Insurance laws.



(f) _Survival_. All Sections of this Agreement survive beyond the Term except
as otherwise specifically stated. 



(g) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if each of the parties had signed the
same document. All counterparts shall be construed together and shall
constitute one and the same instrument.



14\. _Houston Astros Tickets_. With respect to the Houston Astros
season tickets purchased by the Company for the 2005 season, in the event the
Effective Date occurs prior to the end of 2005 season, the Company will sell
to Consultant all then remaining tickets at cost. With respect to the Houston
Astros season tickets after the 2005 season, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Date the Company will, for no additional
consideration, deliver to the Consultant a letter or other written instrument
satisfactory to the Houston Astros organization transferring to the
Consultant all rights to purchase such tickets (at Consultants own cost) in
the future.



15\. _Spinnaker Name_. In due course following the Effective Date, the
Surviving Corporation intends to change its name to delete the reference
to "Spinnaker" from its corporate name. The Surviving Corporation will give
Consultant not less than fifteen (15) days prior notice of its intention to
effect such name change and will notify Consultant of the date on which the
name change will be effected and cooperate with Consultant so that Consultant
may take such action Consultant deems appropriate to preserve Consultants
right to use the name "Spinnaker" in the future. In addition, effective as of
such name change, Surviving Corporation will convey to Consultant, for no
additional consideration, all of its rights, title and interest in and to the
name "Spinnaker" and all derivatives thereof.
