conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, at which time the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall survive the Merger as a direct or indirect

Date, the Company and Merger Sub will file a certificate of merger meeting
the requirements of the Delaware Law with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, or at such later time as the Company and Merger Sub may agree
and specify in the certificate of merger (such time as the Merger becomes
effective, the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   (c) From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges
and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided
under the Delaware Law.   (d) The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING")
shall take place (i) at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and
Jacobson LLP located at One New York Plaza, New York, New York, as soon as
practicable (but in any event no later than the second Business Day) after

waived (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of such
conditions) or (ii) at such other place and time or on such other date as the
Company and Merger Sub may agree in writing (the actual date of the Closing,

Effective Time, pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of the Common Stock:   (a) Each share of Common Stock held by the
Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be
made or delivered with respect thereto.   (b) Each Merger Sub Common Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and the foregoing shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (c) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Common Shares to be canceled pursuant
to Section 2.2(a), automatically shall be canceled and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration,    -8-   payable to the
holder thereof upon surrender of the stock certificate formerly representing
such Common Share in the manner provided in Section 2.3. Such Common Shares,
other than those canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a), sometimes are referred
to herein as the "MERGER SHARES."   (d) If between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of outstanding Common Shares is
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split-
up, combination, exchange of shares or the like, other than pursuant to the
Merger, the amount of Merger Consideration payable per Common Share shall be
correspondingly adjusted.   (e) The Company Options shall be treated as
provided in Section 2.4 below.   Section 2.3 Payment of Cash for Merger
Shares.   (a) Parent and the Company will use good faith efforts to
agree upon a form of letter of transmittal promptly after the date hereof,
in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(c). If the
Company determines to do so, it may mail the agreed form of letter of
transmittal to each or any record holder of Merger Shares prior to the
Closing Date. No later than five days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
may deliver to Parent a schedule (the "Section 2.3 Schedule") setting forth
the names of those Persons who have returned duly executed letters of
transmittal, the number of Merger Shares held by those Persons and wire
instructions for those Persons. At the Closing and upon surrender by the
Person(s) named in the Section 2.3 Schedule of the stock certificate or
certificates representing the Merger Shares held by such Person(s) and a
properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other
documents Parent may reasonably request, Parent shall pay (by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to the account specified in the Section 2.3
Schedule) to the Persons complying with the foregoing, the
Merger Consideration payable in exchange for the Merger Shares so
surrendered, less any amounts required to be withheld under any applicable
Tax Law.   (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that is
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least
$1,000,000,000 to serve as the disbursing agent for the Merger Consideration
and payments in respect of Company Options (the "DISBURSING AGENT"). At or
prior to the Closing, Parent will cause to be deposited with the Disbursing
Agent cash in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration
in respect of all Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (less any amount to be paid at Closing pursuant to Section
2.3(a)), and any cash necessary to pay for Company Options pursuant to
Section 2.4. Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the Disbursing
Agent and subject to the completion of the Merger, such cash shall be held in
trust for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares and such Company
Options and shall not be used for any other purposes; provided however, that
Parent may direct the Disbursing Agent to invest such cash in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, as long as no such investments
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
Section 2.3(c) or Section 2.4 hereof.   (c) As promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time (but no later than two Business Days after the Effective
Time), the Surviving Corporation shall send, or cause the   
-9-   Disbursing Agent to send, to each record holder of Merger Shares as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time which have not already returned a
letter of transmittal under Section 2.3(a) a letter of transmittal and
instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the Merger Consideration
payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in customary form and
will specify that delivery of Merger Shares will be effected, and risk of
loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of the stock certificates
representing the Merger Shares to the Disbursing Agent. In addition to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.3, the letter of transmittal
will include other customary terms and conditions applicable to the surrender
of stock certificates and payment of the Merger Consideration, including,
without limitation, as may be required under the Delaware Law, notice of
appraisal rights to such holders of Common Shares entitled thereto. Upon
surrender of such stock certificate or certificates to the Disbursing Agent
together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal
and any other documentation as the Disbursing Agent may reasonably require,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in exchange therefor, less any amounts required to be
withheld under any applicable Tax Law. Until so surrendered and exchanged,
each such certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and until such surrender
and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of such
outstanding certificate in respect thereof.   (d) If payment is to be made
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Merger Shares represented
by the certificate or certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall
be a condition to such payment that the certificate or certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Parent
or Disbursing Agent (as the case may be) any applicable stock transfer taxes
or establish to the satisfaction of the Parent or Disbursing Agent (as the
case may be) that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not
payable.   (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing Merger Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, such shares shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article II.   (f) If any cash deposited with
the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed six months after the Effective Time,
such cash shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any
such holder who has not surrendered his Merger Shares certificates for the
Merger Consideration prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable
to any holder of Merger Shares for an amount paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares, as of a date immediately prior to such
time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority, shall to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.     -10-    (g)
No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate for Common Shares.   (h)
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Common Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Common Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Agreement.   (i) In the event that any
Merger Share certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, and upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Merger Share
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting by
such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Merger
Share certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Merger Share certificate the proper amount of the
Merger Consideration.   (j) Parent, Surviving Corporation and the
Disbursing Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable hereunder any amounts required to be deducted
and withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the holder from whose Merger Consideration the amounts were so
deducted and withheld.   Section 2.4 Treatment of Options.   (a) As of the
Effective Time, each Company Option will be cancelled, and the holder thereof
will receive an amount equal to the excess of (A) the Merger Consideration
times the number of Common Shares subject to the Company Option over (B) the
aggregate exercise price of such Company Option, without interest and less
any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable Tax
Law. All payments with respect to canceled Company Options shall be made by
the Disbursing Agent as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time from funds deposited with the Disbursing Agent by or at the
direction of Parent to pay such amounts.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company (i) will cause the Company\'s stock option plans to be terminated
effective at or prior to the Effective Time and to otherwise make any
amendments permitted by such plans and the agreements thereunder to the terms
of such stock option plans or the grants made thereunder necessary to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.4 and (ii) will
effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.4.   Section 2.5
Dissenting Company Stock. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such Common Shares who
have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance
with Section 262 of the Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Company Stock") will
not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
holders of such shares of Dissenting Company Stock will be entitled   
-11-   to receive payment of the appraised value of such Common Shares in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such
holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to
appraisal and payment under the Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time,
any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
rights, such Common Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of Common Shares prior to the Effective Time. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.   ARTICLE III.  THE SURVIVING CORPORATION  
Section 3.1 Articles of Incorporation. The articles of incorporation
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the terms thereof and as provided by applicable
Law.   Section 3.2 Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and as provided by
applicable Law.   Section 3.3 Directors and Officers. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law.   ARTICLE

Company\'s ability to observe and perform its obligations hereunder.  
Section 4.4 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by the

supplemented or amended since the time of filing, the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS").
No Company Subsidiary, other than Noveon, Inc., is required to file with or

in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Since the
Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any event, occurrence or development
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For purposes of
this Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY" means any
circumstance, event, change, development or occurrence that, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other circumstances, events,

there has not been:   (i) any material damage, destruction or loss to any of
the  material assets or properties of the Company or any of its material 
Subsidiaries (whether or not insured);   (ii) any amendment or change in the
Company\'s organizational  or governing documents;   (iii) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any  dividend or distribution or capital return

be) or any securities  exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into
the same; or   (xi) any agreement to take any actions specified in this 
Section 4.8(b), except for this Agreement.   Section 4.9 Litigation. Except
as set forth in Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Letter, there is no material

Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
the Company\'s directors or officers relating to the actions or omissions of
any such individuals in connection with their respective roles as directors

will timely file or cause to be timely filed with the appropriate Taxing
Authorities all material Tax Returns that are required to be filed on or

Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby.    
-18-    (b) All material Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
for all taxable years or periods that end as of or before the Effective Time,

records of the Company in accordance with GAAP. The provision for Taxes
in the Balance Sheet is sufficient in all material respects to cover all
Tax liabilities, fixed or contingent, attributable to all taxable years or
periods ending on or prior to the Balance Sheet Date.   (c) Except as set
forth in Section 4.10 of the Disclosure Letter, since the date of formation
of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
included in any "consolidated," "unitary" or "combined" Tax Return provided
for under the law of the United States or any nation, state, locality or
other jurisdiction with respect to Taxes for any taxable period for which the

"consolidated," "unitary" or "combined" group of which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries was the common parent.   (d) All material Taxes which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is (or was) required by law to withhold or
collect have been duly withheld or collected and have been timely paid over
to the proper authorities to the extent due and payable.   (e) The Company

thereof and any other party (including any of the Company\'s shareholders,
but excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) under which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries could be liable for any Taxes or other claims of any
such other party.   (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
applied for, been granted, or agreed to any accounting method change for
which it will be required to take into account any adjustment under Section
481 of the Code (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any similar provision
of the Code or the corresponding tax laws of any nation, state, locality or
other jurisdiction).   (h) There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except Liens for current Taxes not yet
due.   (i) Except for those transactions fully disclosed in Section 4.10 of
the Disclosure Letter for which full documentation has been provided
to Parent, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has participated in a reportable transaction under Section
6011 of the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.   (j)
Except as set forth in Section 4.10(j) of the Disclosure Letter, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement that would
require it to make any payment that would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" for purposes of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.    
-19-    (k) Since March 1, 2001, excluding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, there has
not been an ownership change (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code)
of the Company.   Section 4.11 ERISA.   (a) Section 4.11(a) of the

all Material Employment Agreements (other than the Executive Change of
Control Agreements) for active, retired or former employees or directors that
are maintained or contributed to (or with respect to which an obligation
to contribute has been undertaken) and with respect to which any
potential liability is borne by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each
such plan or program an "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN"). Except for the Executive

Actions by the Company. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,

borrowed money of the Company and its Subsidiaries.   Section 6.3 Access to

notice (i) access to the offices, properties, personnel (including without
limitation the managers in charge of operations and the managers responsible
for environmental, intellectual property, human resources, tax, insurance,
accounting and treasury), books and records of the Company (so long as such
access does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company) as
Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request, (ii) access to the Owned Real
Property and Leased Real Property (including any facilities located thereon)
of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for purposes of performing Phase
I environmental site assessments as Parent shall determine to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with its due diligence review (provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent be permitted to conduct any sampling
or intrusive investigation of air,    -32-   soil, sediment,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives
shall not have access to any books, records and other information the
disclosure of which would, in the Company\'s good faith opinion after
consultation with legal counsel, result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege with respect to such books, records and other information or
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their representatives to
violate Law or any contracts to which they are party (provided that, in the
case of any contract that restricts the Company or its Subsidiaries from
permitting third parties to review such contract, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of the applicable parties under
the contract to the review of such agreement by Parent and its
representatives and provided further that the Company will not invoke the
attorney-client privilege to prevent Parent from gaining access to the
Company\'s environmental reports and assessments). Any information provided
to Parent or Merger Sub or their representatives pursuant to this Section 6.3
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.   (b) If Parent elects
to obtain updated surveys of any or all of the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property, the Company shall provide access to the sites to be
surveyed and shall cooperate with the Parent in arrangement for expeditious

the Company shall request estoppel certificates, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the Company, from any party other

Properties, and shall use its reasonable efforts to assist the Parent in
obtaining such estoppel certificates.   (d) Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, the Company shall from time to time, during normal

Parent and its officers regarding the operations and financial performance of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.   Section 6.4 Other Potential
Acquirers.   (a) The Company shall immediately terminate, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their representatives to immediately terminate,
all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person (other than
Parent and Merger Sub) with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Third Party Acquisition.   (b) Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates shall, nor shall the Company
authorize or permit any of its or their respective officers and directors to,
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective non-controlled Affiliates, employees, representatives and agents
not to, directly or indirectly, knowingly encourage, solicit or engage in
discussions or negotiations with or provide    -33-   any non-public
information to, or afford access to any of the properties, books or records
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party or its representatives
concerning any Third Party Acquisition. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent and Merger Sub in the event it receives any proposal or inquiry
concerning (or that would reasonably be expected to lead to) a Third Party
Acquisition, including (to the extent permitted) the material terms
and conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such proposal
or inquiry, and shall keep them reasonably apprised as to the status and
any material developments concerning the same.   Section 6.5 Resignation of
Directors. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent
and Merger Sub evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Merger Sub of

the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and (ii) the officers of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries, as shall be requested by Parent prior to the
Effective Time.   Section 6.6 ISRA Filings. Prior to Closing, the Company

with the provisions of the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act, N.J.S.A.
Section 13:1K-6 et seq., (i) a "Negative Declaration," (ii) "No Further
Action Letter," (iii) a "remedial action workplan," (iv) a "remediation
agreement," (v) approval of an expedited review application under N.J.S.A.
13:1K-11.2, (vi) approval of a remediation in progress waiver application
under N.J.S.A. 13:1K-11.5, or (vii) a determination that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may proceed without further approvals by NJDEP
and without further actions by the Company; in each case, with respect to the
Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property, as the case may be, located in
New Jersey.   Section 6.7 FIRPTA Certificate. Prior to the Effective Time,
(i) the Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a certificate signed
under penalties of perjury by an officer of the Company to the effect that
the Company is not or has not been a United States real property holding

period described in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.   ARTICLE VII. 
COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB   Section 7.1 Director and Officer
Liability.   (a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and after the Effective
Time Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with all of
the Company\'s and its respective Subsidiaries\' obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless (including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the
present and former officers and directors thereof in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time to the extent provided
under the Company\'s or such Subsidiaries\' respective organizational and
governing documents in effect on the date hereof, and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of the Surviving Corporation\'s articles of incorporation and
bylaws from the Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statue
of limitations with respect to any claims against such directors or officers
arising out of such acts or omissions. Any    -34-   determination
required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of an individual
seeking indemnification has complied with the standards set forth under
applicable Law shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable
to the Surviving Corporation and such individual. For a period of six years
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its respective Subsidiaries
(the "CURRENT POLICIES"); provided however, that the Surviving Corporation
may, and in the event of the cancellation or termination of such policies the
Surviving Corporation shall, substitute such policies with equally reputable
and financially sound carriers and that are reasonably satisfactory to the
covered persons providing at least the same coverage and amount and
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered
persons (the "REPLACEMENT POLICIES") in respect of claims arising from facts
or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time under
the Current Policies; provided further however, that in no event will the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in excess of 200% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (or to provide
more than that amount of coverage as is available for no more than 200% of
such current annual premium); provided further however, that in lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, with the consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), the Company may purchase "tail" insurance
coverage that provides coverage no less favorable than the coverage described
above.   (b) This Section 7.1 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
present or former directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
their respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on
the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective successors and
assigns, and the agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be
deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any such present or
former director or officer is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors\' and officers\'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7.1 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under any such policies.   (c) If Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or (ii) transfers or conveys
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in
each case to the extent reasonably necessary, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.1.  
ARTICLE VIII.  COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES   The parties hereto agree
that:   Section 8.1 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each party will (and will cause its
Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to take,    -35-   or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all
documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including obtaining all necessary consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental Authorities or other
Persons; provided that in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates
be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any material fee, penalties or
other consideration to any third party to obtain any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the Merger under any material contracts.
Each party shall also (and will cause its Affiliates to) refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly any action (including making acquisitions), that would
be reasonably likely to result in a failure of any of the conditions to the
Merger in this Agreement being satisfied or restrict such party\'s ability to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (i)
to take all action necessary so that no takeover, anti-takeover, moratorium,
"fair price," "control share" or other similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such Law is or becomes
applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 8.2 Certain Filings.   (a) The parties shall
cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from any
parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in seeking and obtaining
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith; provided that the
conditions to the parties\' respective obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to those conditions
specified in Article IX. The parties shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will consult the other
on, all the information relating to the other and each of their respective
Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
Company and Parent shall promptly notify and provide a copy to the other
party of any written communication received from any Governmental Authority
with respect to any filing or submission or with respect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company
and Parent shall give the other reasonable prior notice of any communication
with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any such filing or any such transaction.
Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective
representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party
prior notice of such meeting or conversation and without giving, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity of the other party
to attend or participate. The parties to this Agreement will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearance,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made
or    -36-   submitted by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement in
connection with proceedings under or related to the HSR Act or Other
Antitrust Laws.   (b) The parties (i) shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken such actions as may be required to
be taken under the Exchange Act and state securities or applicable Blue Sky
Laws in connection with the Merger and (ii) shall promptly prepare and file
all necessary documentation, effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions and filings, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents from any Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Merger
(including, without limitation, any filing under the HSR Act or any
applicable Other Antitrust Law).   (c) If required, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall take all reasonable action necessary (i) to file
as soon as practicable notifications or other required items under the HSR
Act and any applicable Other Antitrust Law, (ii) to respond as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional information or
documentation, (iii) to comply with the requirements of, and respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to all inquiries and requests for
additional information received from any Governmental Authority in connection
with, the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Laws related to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) to use reasonable best
efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act or
any Other Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible and in any event no later than the End Date.   Section
8.3 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties
will use reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any
press release or public statement a party determines may be required by
applicable Law or the New York Stock Exchange, will not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the consent of the other
parties (not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld).  
Section 8.4 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company.   Section 8.5 Notices of Certain
Events. Each of the parties hereto shall reasonably promptly notify the other
party of:   (a) the receipt by such party of any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;    -37-    (b) the receipt by such party of any notice
or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and   (c) its learning of
any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced against,
or affecting such party that, if they were pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement or which relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) its learning of any events,
circumstances, developments or facts that would make any of the
representations and warranties of such party contained in this Agreement
untrue or any of the covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement
incapable of being satisfied.   Section 8.6 Disposition of Litigation. The
Company will consult with Parent and Merger Sub with respect to any action by
any Third Party to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will use reasonable
best efforts to resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit or otherwise
oppose the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In addition, the Company will not encourage or cooperate with any Third Party
to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company will reasonably
cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to resist any such effort to restrain or
prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 8.7 Employee Matters.   (a) From
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor, or shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, all Employee Plans and all
Employment Agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time. For a period of not less than one year following
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"COMPANY EMPLOYEES") employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to the Company
Employees immediately before the Effective Time, with the exception of those
changes collectively bargained with authorized union representatives. The
foregoing shall not be construed to prevent (i) the amendment or termination
of any particular Employee Benefit Plan or Employment Agreement to the extent
permitted by, and in accordance with, its terms and the terms of any contract
related thereto, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time or (ii)
the termination of employment of any individual Company Employee.   (b) For
all purposes (other than benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans)
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "NEW PLANS"),
except as would result in a duplication of benefits, each Company Employee
shall be credited with all years of service for which such Company Employee
was credited before the Effective Time under any similar Employee Benefit
Plans. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time or satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in
any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan in    -38-   which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans, collectively, the "OLD PLANS") and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and any expenses
incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.   Section 8.8 Confidentiality
Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent entered into
the Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement shall be deemed incorporated
herein as if it were set forth in its entirety, and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the expiration of that Confidentiality Agreement
according to its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein or
in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, any party to this Agreement
(and their employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and
tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all
material of any kind (including opinions or other tax analysis) that are
provided to such party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure;
provided however, that this sentence shall not permit any disclosure that
otherwise is prohibited by this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or
any other confidentiality agreement between or among the parties as of the
date hereof or where such disclosure would result in a violation of federal
or state securities Laws or to the extent not related to the tax aspects of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to limit in any way any party\'s ability to consult any
tax advisor regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE IX.  CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   Section

TERMINATION   Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time

the Company):   (a) by mutual written consent of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand;   (b) by any of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, if:   (i) the Merger has not been consummated
by the End Date,  provided that the failure of the Merger to be consummated
by such date  is not the result of, or caused by, the failure of the party
seeking to  exercise such termination right to fulfill any of its obligations
under  this Agreement; or   (ii) there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the  Merger illegal or otherwise permanently prohibited,
provided that, in  the case of any such Law issued by a court, it shall be
final and  non-appealable; provided however, that the right to terminate
this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall not be available 
to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in  the
application or imposition of such Law;   (c) by the Company, if a breach of
or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.3(a)
or (b) to be unable to be satisfied by the End Date; provided however, that
the Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement; or   (d) by
Parent or Merger Sub, if a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause the
condition set forth in Section 9.2(a) to be unable to be satisfied by the End
Date; provided however, that Parent or Merger Sub is not then in material
breach of this Agreement.     -41-   The party desiring to terminate

respect to any liabilities for damages incurred or suffered by a party as a

of whether any party undertakes any investigation into the subject matter of

liability to Parent or its Affiliates with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 11.3 Amendments No Waivers.

Law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company shall not
be effective without such further shareholder approval.   (b) No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies herein
provided or available at Law or in equity.   Section 11.4 Expenses. All

by the party incurring such cost or expense.   Section 11.5 Transfer Taxes.
Subject to Section 2.3(c), all stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such taxes) ("TRANSFER TAXES") incurred in

by either Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and such parties
shall cooperate with each other in preparing, executing and filing any
returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.    -43-    Section 11.6
Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto. Any purported
assignment in violation of this provisions shall be null and void ab
initio.   Section 11.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to the conflicts or choice of law principles of those
states.   Section 11.8 Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective only when actually signed by each party
hereto and each such party has received counterparts hereof signed by all of
the other parties hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to or
shall confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder or with respect hereto, except with respect to the matters
provided in Section 2.3 and Section 7.1.   Section 11.9 Severability. If
any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by virtue of any Law, or due to any public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled
to the extent possible.   Section 11.10 Specific Performance. The parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform its
agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions
as are necessary on its part to consummate the Merger, will cause irreparable
injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not
be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the
issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to
compel performance of such party\'s obligations and to the granting by any
court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder, in
addition to any other rights or remedies available hereunder or at law or in
equity.   Section 11.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter
and supersedes all oral or written prior or contemporaneous agreements
and understandings among the parties with respect to such subject matter.  
Section 11.12 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that
any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the Court
of    -44-   Chancery of the State of Delaware, County of New Castle or,
if such court does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of such
proceeding or if such jurisdiction is not available, in the United State
District Court for the District of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
that such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
suit, action or proceeding in any of those courts or that any suit, action or
proceeding that is brought in any of those courts has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any suit, action or proceeding may be served
on any party at the applicable address provided in Section 11.1, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any of the named courts. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on it by
notice as provided in Section 11.1 shall be deemed effective service of
process. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waives any
right it may have to trial by jury in any court or jurisdiction in respect to
any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 11.13 Authorship. The parties agree that the
terms and language of this Agreement were the result of negotiations between
the parties, and as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship.   [signature page follows]
