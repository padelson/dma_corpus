ARTICLE I

 



 

THE OFFER

 



 

SECTION 1.01 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Commencement_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Article IX, Merger Sub shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, by 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on July 25,
2011) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer to purchase for cash all Shares at the Offer Price. The obligations of
Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer shall be subject to only those conditions set forth in _Exhibit
A_ (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "). The Company agrees that no shares of
Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any
such shares held on behalf of third parties) will be tendered pursuant to the
Offer.

 



 

(b) _Waiver of Tender Offer Conditions_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right from time to time, in its sole discretion, to waive any Tender Offer
Condition or to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (i) decrease the
Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii)
decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii)
amend, modify or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in
_Exhibit A_ ) or the HSR Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_ ), (iv) amend or
modify any of the other Tender Offer Conditions in a manner that is, or would
reasonably be expected to be, adverse to the Companys stockholders, (v)
impose additional conditions to the Offer, (vi) extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1.01(d)) in a manner other than
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement or (vii) amend any other
term of the Offer in a manner that is, or would reasonably be expected to be,
adverse to the Companys stockholders.

 



 

(c) _Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Merger Sub shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") and the related offer to purchase,
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively, and including any

 



      
 

 



 

supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause
the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders as and to
the extent required by the applicable U.S. federal securities Laws and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities
Laws_ "). The Company agrees to furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning the Company required by the Securities Laws to be set forth in the
Offer Documents. Subject to Section 7.03(b), the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation (as defined
in Section 4.04(b)). Each Party agrees to correct or supplement promptly any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or such amendment or supplement shall become necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so amended or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to
be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case, as and to the
extent required by the Securities Laws. Unless the Company Board has effected
an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in Section 7.03(b)), Parent will
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents, and any amendments or supplements thereto, before they are
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, and Parent
shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company. Parent shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to
the Offer Documents and provide copies of such comments to the Company
promptly upon receipt and, unless the Company Board has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change, provide copies of proposed responses to the Company a
reasonable time prior to filing with the SEC and dissemination to the
Companys stockholders to allow for review and prompt comment by the Company,
and Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Company.

 



 

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight (New York City time) on the 20th business day
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following
the commencement of the Offer (the initial expiration date, or such subsequent
date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Merger Sub shall extend the Expiration Date
for any period required by the Securities Laws, the interpretations and
positions of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto or the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") applicable to the
Offer or as may be required by any other Governmental Entity and (ii) if upon
the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, all Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub collectively
would not beneficially own at least 90% of the Shares then outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis (assuming the issuance of all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of all outstanding Company Stock Options (as defined in
Section 3.05(a)), Company SARs (as defined in Section 3.05(b)), warrants and
other rights to purchase shares of Common Stock and, for this purpose, the
delivery to Merger Sub of the Top-Up Option Shares (as defined in Section
1.04(a)) pursuant to the exercise in full of the Top-Up Option (as defined in
Section 1.04(a))), Merger Sub may, and the Offer Documents shall preserve the
right to, without the consent of the Company (but subject to prior
consultation with the Company), elect to provide a "subsequent offering
period" for the Offer in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of not more than 15 business days, as
determined by Merger Sub in consultation with the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act,
Merger Sub shall immediately accept for payment and promptly (and in any event
within three business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under
the Exchange Act)) pay for all Shares tendered during any such subsequent
offering period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Article IX (and subject to each Partys rights to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Article IX), if at any scheduled Expiration Date the Tender
Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived, Merger Sub
shall extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date that is not more than
10 business days after such previously scheduled Expiration Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer and the
Expiration Date to a date later than the Outside Date (as defined in Section
9.01(b)(i)). Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer without the
prior written consent of the Company other than in connection with the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX. In the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article IX prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours
of such termination) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer.

 



 

(e) _Acceptance of and Payment for Shares_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub
in accordance with Section 1.01(b) of the Tender Offer Conditions as of the
Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall promptly on or after the Expiration Date
accept for payment (such time of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance
Time_ ") and promptly (and in any event within three business days (calculated
as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)) pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to have on a timely basis the funds necessary to
purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer.

 



 

(f) _Withholding_. Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any of the
Companys stockholders such amounts as Merger Sub is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority (as defined in Section
4.16(h)(i)) by Merger Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Company stockholder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Merger Sub.

 



 

(g) _Notices of Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement,
including the exercise of the Top-Up Option, and the Offer, unless otherwise
mutually agreed to by the Company and Merger Sub, any Shares subject to
notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into
the Offer unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed
delivery are delivered to or on behalf of Merger Sub.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 1.02 _Company Action_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. The Company shall file with the SEC as promptly as
practicable on the date on which Parent and Merger Sub file the Offer
Documents with the SEC, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, and including the exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which
shall, subject to Section 7.03(b), include the Company Recommendation, and
shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to its stockholders, in each case, as and
to the extent required by the Securities Laws. The Company agrees promptly to
correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall become false or
misleading in any material respect (and each of Parent and Merger Sub, with
respect to information supplied by it specifically for use in the Schedule
14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company of any required corrections of such
information and cooperate with the Company with respect to correcting such
information) and to supplement the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9
to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and the Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as
so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to its
stockholders as and to the extent required by the Securities Laws. Unless the
Company Board has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
Section 7.03(c), Parent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments or supplements thereto before
they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Companys stockholders, and
the Company shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent. The Company shall respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and provide copies of such comments to Parent
promptly upon receipt and, unless the Company Board has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 7.03(c), provide copies of
proposed responses to Parent a reasonable time prior to filing with the SEC
and dissemination to the Companys stockholders to allow for review and prompt
comment by Parent, and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent.

 



 

(b) _Stockholder Information_. In connection with the Offer, promptly
following the date of this Agreement the Company shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to Parent mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all
of its stockholders of record, a non-objecting beneficial owners list and
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, and shall promptly furnish Parent with such additional
information, including updated lists of stockholders and beneficial owners,
mailing labels, security position listings and computer files, and such other
information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request for
the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial
owners of Shares. In addition, in connection with the Offer the Company shall,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause third parties to, cooperate
with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders
of Shares held in or subject to any Company Stock Plan (as defined in Section
4.03(a)) and to permit such holders of Shares to tender their Shares into the
Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and Merger
Sub and their agents (i) shall hold in confidence the information contained in
any such labels, listings and files and will use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and (ii) following the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, shall promptly, at the election
of Parent, deliver

 



      
 

 



 

to the Company or destroy, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their agents to deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies and any extract
or summaries of such information then in their possession or control and
promptly certify to the Company in writing that all such material has been
returned or destroyed.

 



 

SECTION 1.03 _Directors_.

 



 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Promptly upon the
purchase of, and payment for, a number of Shares by Merger Sub pursuant to the
Offer that represents at least such number of Shares as shall satisfy the
Minimum Condition, and at all times thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to
elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number (subject to a maximum of eight such designees in the event that the
maximum size of the Company Board pursuant to the Company Bylaws is eleven),
to the Company Board as will give Parent representation on the Company Board
equal to that number of directors that equals the product of (i) the total
number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors
appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent
and its Affiliates (including for purposes of this Section 1.03(a) such Shares
as are accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the Offer) bears to the
total number of Shares, and the Company shall cause Parents designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board, including by increasing the number
of directors, seeking and accepting the resignation of incumbent directors and
taking any other actions that are necessary to accomplish the foregoing. At
each such time, the Company shall also cause (A) each committee of the Company
Board (other than the Independent Director Committee (as defined in Section
1.03(b))) and (B) if requested by Parent, each board of directors (or similar
governing body) of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof)
to include persons designated by Parent representing at least the same
percentage of each such committee, board or governing body as Parents
designees represent on the Company Board, in each case to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and the rules of the NYSE. The Companys obligations under
this Section 1.03 shall be subject to applicable Law, including Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of
this Section 1.03 are in addition to, and shall not limit, any rights that
Parent or Merger Sub may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares
as a matter of Law or otherwise with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

 



 

(b) _Independent Directors_. In the event that Parents designees are
appointed or elected to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.03(a), then
until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.03), Parent and the Company
shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) cause at least three members of
the Company Board as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, who are
neither officers of the Company nor designees, stockholders, Affiliates or
associates (within the meaning of the Securities Laws) of Parent and who will
be independent and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee for
purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
the NYSE (" _Independent_ ," and such Independent directors, the "
_Independent Directors_ ") to remain as directors, (ii) cause at least one of
the Independent Directors to be an "audit committee financial expert" as
defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC and (iii) designate
a committee of the Company Board, which shall be composed solely of
Independent Directors and which shall, subject to applicable Law, be delegated
all power, right and authority of the Company Board with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to the Independent Director Committee Actions (as defined in Section 1.03(c))
(the " _Independent Director Committee_ ") and to continue the existence of
such Independent Director Committee until the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if at any time there are fewer than three Independent
Directors on the Independent Director Committee, the Company Board will take
all action necessary to cause an Independent person or, if there is only one
Independent Director on the Independent Director Committee, two Independent
persons designated by the remaining Independent Director(s) to fill such
vacancy(ies), and each such person shall be deemed to be an Independent
Director for purposes of this Agreement, or, if there are no Independent
Directors on the Independent Director Committee, the Company Board shall
designate three Independent persons to fill such vacancies, and each such
person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Independent Director Approval_. After directors designated by Parent are
elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.03(a) and
prior to the Effective Time, the approval of the Independent Director
Committee, by a majority vote of its members, shall be required for the
Company to authorize (and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no
other action on the part of the Company Board or the Company, including any
action by any other director, shall be required to authorize) (i) any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this
Agreement, (iii) any extension of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or actions hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) any waiver of
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the
benefit of the Company or its stockholders, (v) except as provided herein, any
amendment of the governing documents of the Company if any such amendment
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the holders of Shares (other
than Parent or Merger Sub), or (vi) the taking of any other action or making
of any other determination of the Company Board under or in connection with
this Agreement if such action would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Merger Sub) (clauses (i) through
(vi), the " _Independent Director Committee Actions_ "). The Independent
Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Independent Directors to
have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel
to the Company or the Company Board) and other advisors at the expense of the
Company as determined by the Independent Director Committee, and the authority
to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Section 14 of the Exchange Act_. The Company shall promptly take all
action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03,
including mailing to its stockholders an information statement containing the
information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder, and the Company agrees to make such mailing concurrently with the
mailing of the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Merger Sub shall supply the Company
with, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to itself
and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1 to be included in such information statement.

 



 

(e) _Effects on Continued Listing_. Following the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated
as a

 



      
 

 



 

"controlled company" as defined by Rule 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual
(or any successor provision) and make all necessary filings and disclosures
associated with such status.

 



 

SECTION 1.04 _Top-Up Option_.

 



 

(a) _Top-Up Option Grant_. The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an
irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price that number of shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up
Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Common Stock that,
when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its Affiliates at the
time of such exercise, shall constitute one share of Common Stock more than
the number of Shares (the " _Short-Form Threshold_ ") necessary for Merger Sub
to be merged into the Company without a vote or consent of the Companys
stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable (i) to the extent that the number of
Top-Up Option Shares would exceed the number of the Companys then authorized
and unissued shares of Common Stock that are not otherwise reserved or
committed to be issued; and (ii) unless, immediately after such exercise and
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, the Short-Form
Threshold would be reached (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares).

 



 

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up_. The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once in
whole and not in part after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article IX. In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such
notice (i) the number of Shares owned by Parent and its Affiliates immediately
preceding the exercise of the Top-Up Option and (ii) the place and time for
the closing of the exercise of the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ ").
The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice,
notify Parent in writing of the number of Shares and the number of Top-Up
Option Shares and, upon request of Parent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to
Merger Sub the number of Shares as of immediately prior to the exercise of the
Top-Up Option. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall cause the Company to be
paid the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares and
the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing
the Top-Up Option Shares. The purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company
to purchase the Top-Up Option Shares shall be paid to the Company at the Top-
Up Closing, at Merger Subs option, (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day
funds, or (ii) by (x) paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an
amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option
Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up
Option Shares less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the immediately
preceding clause (x) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note (A)
shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (B) shall bear
simple interest of 5% per annum, (C) shall be full recourse to Merger Sub, (D)
may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty
and (E) shall have no other material terms. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing herein shall be construed to obligate Merger Sub to exercise the Top-
Up Option.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from
registration under the Securities Act for transactions not involving a public
offering. Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company
that Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be
acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to,
or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning
of the Securities Act).

 



 

(d) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of
the Parties agrees and acknowledges that in any appraisal proceeding under
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 3.03(a)), the Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 2.01) shall
not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any cash or the
Promissory Note delivered to the Company in payment for such Top-Up Option
Shares should be considered in connection with the determination of the fair
value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

(e) _Assignment of Top-Up Option_. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law
or otherwise, and any attempted assignment in violation of this Section
1.04(e) shall be null and void.

SECTION 2.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that if any
such holder shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holders rights

at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 3.04(d), as provided in Section 3.01, and
such holder thereof shall cease to have any other rights with respect thereto.

SECTION 3.04 _Exchange for Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time and from time to time thereafter to the extent
necessary, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with a paying agent
selected by Parent (which entity shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of holders of Eligible
Shares, cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient in the
aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments
pursuant to Section 3.01(b) (such cash amount excluding any interest or other
earnings thereon, collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(ii) The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent,
but no such investment or losses therefrom shall affect the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Shares, and Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of holders of Eligible
Shares equal to the amount of any such losses. Any interest or income produced
by such investments shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be
payable to Parent upon demand or as Parent otherwise directs.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Upon Parent becoming aware that a holder of Dissenting Shares has
effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such holders rights under Section 262
of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall make available
or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an
amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Dissenting Shares and
(y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in no
event later than three business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be mailed to each record holder of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time: (A) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Company Certificates held by such holder shall pass only upon
proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Company Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth
in the letter of transmittal) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares for payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration therefor. Such letter of transmittal
shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to the Company
prior to the Effective Time).

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender by a holder of Eligible Shares to the Paying Agent of a
Company Certificate, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, or delivery to the
Paying Agent of an "agents message" in respect of Company Book-Entry Shares
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), such holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any
required withholdings pursuant to Section 3.04(d)) equal to the product of (x)
the number of Eligible Shares represented by such holders properly
surrendered Company Certificates and/or Company Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and such Company
Certificates and/or Company Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled.

 



 

(iii) If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Company Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Company Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid to
the Paying Agent any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that all such Taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(iv) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the record owner thereof and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such record owner of a bond in customary
amount and upon such reasonable terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate

 



      
 

 



 

the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Eligible Shares represented by such Company Certificate pursuant to this
Article III (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in Section 3.04(d)).

 



 

(v) No interest shall be paid, payable or accrued for the benefit of holders
of the Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares on the Per Share
Merger Consideration payable in respect of their Eligible Shares. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Agreement, each Company Certificate or
Company Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all
purposes only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.04(d)), the
payment of which shall be deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all rights
pertaining to Eligible Shares represented thereby and converted in the Merger.

 



 

(vi) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Common Stock. After the Effective Time, Company Certificates or
Company Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 3.04(d), in accordance and upon compliance with the
procedures set forth in this Article III.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the Companys stockholders on the date that is 180
days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation
upon its demand, and any of the Companys stockholders who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 3.04(d), payable pursuant to this Article
III upon due surrender of their Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry
Shares. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any holder of Eligible Shares for any cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by the Companys stockholders at such date as is immediately prior
to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of any claims or interests of any such stockholders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(d) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Eligible Shares
or Dissenting Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the

 



      
 

 



 

Eligible Shares or Dissenting Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as applicable.

 



 

SECTION 3.05 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of any outstanding
option to purchase shares of Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
granted under the Company Stock Plans, each Company Stock Option, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash in U.S. dollars
equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the
Offer Price over the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down
to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash payable to holders of
all Company Stock Options, the " _Option Consideration_ ") less such amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. The
Company shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments

whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Acceptance Time,
and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash in U.S.
dollars equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company SAR and (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the
Offer Price over the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such
Company SAR, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the
nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash payable to holders of all
Company SARs, the " _SAR Consideration_ ") less such amounts as are required
to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or
local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. The Company shall
pay the holders of Company SARs the cash payments described in this Section
3.05(b) at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Acceptance Time.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of any award of
restricted Common Stock (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") granted under the
Company Stock Plans that has not previously vested, immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, each Restricted Share shall be cancelled and forfeited, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount per Restricted Share
in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the Offer Price (the aggregate amount of such
cash payable to holders of all Restricted Shares, the " _Restricted Shares
Consideration_ "), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with
respect to the making of such payment. The Company shall pay the Restricted
Shares Consideration at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Acceptance Time. Any Restricted Shares that vest prior to the cancellation
contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 3.05(c) shall be treated as
shares of Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including Section
1.01 and Section 3.01. No Restricted Share that has not

 



      
 

 



 

vested prior to the cancellation and forfeiture contemplated by the first
sentence of this Section 3.05(c) may be tendered to Merger Sub pursuant to the
Offer.

 



 

(d) Immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit or shall
cause to be deposited with the Company cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay
the Option Consideration, SAR Consideration and the Restricted Shares

Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Common Stock or
other capital stock of the Company to any person pursuant to or in settlement
of Company Stock Options, Company SARs or Restricted Shares after the
Acceptance Time.

or forward-looking in nature) or in the corresponding sections or subsections
of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company in connection with
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) disclosure of any item in any section or

reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure and (ii) no disclosure
contained in the Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to qualify, modify or

jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and has not impaired and would not
reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of the

Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of

SECTION 7.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall afford to Parent, and to
Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other Representatives, reasonable access (including access to core samples,
well logs and seismic data, in each case, that are in the possession of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and including for the purpose of planning
for post-merger integration activities and transition planning with the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the period prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
IX to all its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
personnel and records as Parent may from time to time reasonably request, but
only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and, during such
period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no access or
information pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Company herein; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any of its Subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such copies or
other information to the extent that doing so would violate applicable Law or
any contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party or result
in the loss of attorney-client privilege if, in the case of any such
confidentiality contracts or obligations, the Company shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to have obtained the consent of such third party to
such access, copies or information. If any of the information or material
furnished pursuant to this Section 7.02 includes materials or information
subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other
applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or
governmental investigations, each of the Parties understands and agrees that
the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it
is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the
sharing of such material or information is not intended to, and shall not,
waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or
information or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information
provided by the Company that is entitled to protection under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall
remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and
under the joint defense doctrine. If, notwithstanding the foregoing,
disclosure of such material or information would result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege or violate applicable Law or any contract or
obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, the Parties will use
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements.

 



 

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, as applicable, will hold any such
information that is non-public in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the letter agreement, dated as of June 22,
2011, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

 



 

SECTION 7.03 _No Solicitation_. (a) (i) The Company agrees that neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its and their respective directors or
officers shall, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
other Representatives and employees not to, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of

 



      
 

 



 

providing information) any inquiry or proposal with respect to the making of,
or the making of any offer that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to
the making of, a Takeover Proposal (as defined below), (B) engage in, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person
regarding, or provide to any person any non-public information or data in
connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way with any person with
respect to, any Takeover Proposal, (C) waive, terminate, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any person
other than Parent which would permit such person to make a Takeover Proposal,
(D) approve any transaction under, or any person becoming an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL or (E) otherwise knowingly
facilitate any effort or attempt by any person to arrange or consummate a
Takeover Proposal. The Company will notify its officers and directors, and the
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other advisors that are advising
the Company as of the date of this Agreement with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, of the restrictions imposed by the preceding sentence and
instruct them to comply with those restrictions. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries, its and their directors and officers, and cause its
and their Representatives to (x) immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal, (y)
immediately revoke or withdraw access of any person other than Parent and its
Representatives to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any non-public
information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries previously
furnished with respect to a Takeover Proposal and request from any persons
other than Parent and its Representatives the prompt return or destruction of
all non-public information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries
previously furnished with respect to a Takeover Proposal and (z) take such
action as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality or "standstill"
provisions or provisions of similar effect to which it is a party which would
permit such person to make a Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Section
7.03, "person" means one person or a group (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and
13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of persons.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the
Acceptance Time, but not after, the Company may, either directly or through
its Representatives, (A) provide information in response to a request therefor
by a person that has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal
after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of Section
7.03(a)(i) if the Company receives from the person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement in customary form and with
terms no less restrictive to the other party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement need
not contain a provision that prohibits such person from making Takeover
Proposals) and provides to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with
the delivery of such information to such person a copy of all such information
that was not previously provided to Parent, (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any person who has made such a Takeover
Proposal or (C) after having complied with Section 7.03(c), approve, recommend
or otherwise declare advisable, or propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, such a Takeover Proposal (publicly or otherwise), if and only to
the extent that before taking any of the actions described in (x) the
preceding clauses (A), (B) or (C), the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of the
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and this Agreement, the failure
to take such actions would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (y) the preceding clauses (A) or (B), the Company
Board has also determined in

 



       
 

 



 

good faith based on the information then available (after consultation with
its financial advisors) that such Takeover Proposal either is a Superior
Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (z) the preceding clause (C), the Company Board also determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(iii) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates), including any of the Companys stockholders, relating to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any of the following actions: (A) any
direct or indirect acquisition, purchase, lease or license, in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, of any assets (including Equity
Securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that constitute or
contribute 15% or more of the Companys consolidated revenues, net income or
total assets or 15% or more of the total voting power of Equity Securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, taken together,
constitute, in the aggregate, more than 15% of the Companys consolidated
assets, (B) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of the total voting power
of Equity Securities of the Company or (C) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, issuance or amendment of securities,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, taken together,
constitute, in the aggregate, more than 15% of the Companys consolidated
assets, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(iv) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
unsolicited _bona fide_ Takeover Proposal that provides for the acquisition of
more than 50% of the total voting power of the Equity Securities of the
Company or of any assets (including Equity Securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company) or businesses that constitute or contribute 75% or more of the
Companys consolidated revenues, net income or total assets, and that the
Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and after taking into account
all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such unsolicited _bona fide_
Takeover Proposal (including the estimated time of completion) and the person
making it (A) is likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, (B)
would result, if consummated, in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to
such Takeover Proposal pursuant to Section 7.03(c)) and (C) is fully financed
or, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, is reasonably capable of
being fully financed.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, or (B) make or cause to be made any
public statement proposing or announcing an intention to withhold, withdraw or
modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ the foregoing shall not
prohibit accurate disclosure of factual information (and such disclosure shall
not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) regarding (x) the
business, financial

 



      
 

 



 

condition or results of operations of the Company or (y) the fact that a
Takeover Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such
proposal or the material terms of such proposal, to the extent, in the case of
each of (x) and (y), (1) the Company in good faith determines that such
information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed under
applicable Law and (2) any such disclosure includes the Company Recommendation
without any modification or qualification thereof or discloses the
continuation of the Company Recommendation without disclosing or effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, resolve or
publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, confidentiality agreement, exclusivity agreement, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract (whether or
not creating a legally binding obligation) relating to a Takeover Proposal,
other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 7.03(a) (each,
an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to (but not after) the Acceptance Time and subject to the prior
compliance with the requirements of Section 7.03(c), (x) the Company Board may
make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) the Company may terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(g) and execute or otherwise enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal.
No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of this Agreement,
and no Adverse Recommendation Change shall have the effect of causing any
state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute
to be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Offer and the Merger).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be made pursuant to Section 7.03(b) nor shall the Company be
permitted to take any action pursuant to Section 9.01(g) unless (i) (A) in the
case of an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall have provided
Parent with written notice at least 72 hours prior to making such Adverse
Recommendation Change specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor
(including, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the information required by
the immediately following clause (B)) or (B) in the case of any action to be
taken by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(g), the Company provides written
notice to Parent stating that it intends to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, which written notice
shall be delivered to Parent at least 72 hours prior to the date the Company
intends to enter into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and shall attach
the most current version of such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and, to the
extent not contained in such version, shall set forth the identity of the
person making the Superior Proposal and all the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal in reasonable detail (it being understood and agreed
that any change in the financial terms or any other material amendment to the
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notice by the Company to Parent in compliance with this clause (B)), (ii)
during such 72-hour period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to be available to, engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would eliminate the need for such Adverse Recommendation
Change or the taking by the Company of any action pursuant to Section 9.01(g),
as applicable, (iii) in the case of an

 



      
 

 



 

Adverse Recommendation Change that is the result of a Superior Proposal or the
taking of any action by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(g), the Company
Board shall consider in good faith any proposal by Parent to adjust the terms
and conditions of this Agreement during such 72-hour period, and at the end of
such 72-hour period, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consulting with and receiving the advice of outside legal counsel and the
Companys financial advisor) that the Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal (even if such proposed adjustments were to be
given effect).

 



 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section
7.03(a), Section 7.03(b) and Section 7.03(c), the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) advise Parent
orally and in writing if (i) any Takeover Proposal is received by the Company
(or there are any material changes to the terms thereof) or (ii) any non-
public information or any discussions or negotiations are requested in respect
of any Takeover Proposal and, in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii), the
identity of the person making the Takeover Proposal or such request and
include a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any such
Takeover Proposals or requests that are not made in writing and copies of any
Takeover Proposals or requests made in writing. The Company shall keep Parent
informed (on a reasonably current basis as determined by the circumstances) in
all material respects of the status and details of any Takeover Proposal and
the status of any discussions or negotiations. The Company agrees that it and
its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
person following the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent or otherwise complying with the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.03 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or
state Law with regard to a Takeover Proposal, including taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act, or making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to
the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communications to the Companys stockholders); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall any such requirement eliminate or modify
the effect that any action pursuant to such requirement would otherwise have
under this Section 7.03; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Company
nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to
recommend that the Company stockholders tender any securities in connection
with any tender or exchange offer or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend
any Takeover Proposal, unless in each case, in connection therewith, the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) effects an Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including Section
7.03(c)).

 



 

SECTION 7.04 _Further Action; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to use its reasonable best
efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable hereunder and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
soon as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section
7.04 or elsewhere herein shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or
any of its Affiliates to (nor shall the Company, without the prior written
consent of Parent, be permitted to, in connection with the matters
contemplated by this Section 7.04) (A) (1) sell, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of, divest or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise encumber, or to hold separate pending any such action or (2)
proffer, propose, negotiate, offer to effect or consent, commit or agree to
any sale, divestiture, lease, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestment or
other encumbrance of, or to hold separate, in each case before or after the
Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (B) take or agree to
take any other action, or agree or consent to any limitations or restrictions
on freedom of actions with respect to, or its ability to own, retain or make
changes in, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or Parents ability to
vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights
with respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation or the Company, except,
in the case of either of the foregoing clauses (A) or (B), to the extent such
action or actions would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, (x) restrict in any material respect or otherwise negatively and
materially impact the operation or ownership by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates of the Shares, businesses or assets of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company and/or their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (y) restrict in any
material respect or otherwise negatively and materially impact the operations,
businesses or assets of Parent and its Affiliates (excluding the Company and
its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole (it being agreed and understood that
materiality for purposes of this clause (y) shall be determined assuming
Parent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, were the size of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (any actions described in clauses (A) or
(B) of this proviso that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have the effects described in clauses (x) or (y) of this
proviso being collectively referred to herein as " _Adverse Regulatory
Effects_ "). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party
agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act, (ii) make other required filings pursuant to other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, (iii) obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, waivers, permits, authorizations,
clearances and other actions of or by any Governmental Entity that are
necessary or advisable under or in respect of any Antitrust Laws in order to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
foregoing without the imposition of any adverse conditions, limitations,
requirements or other restrictions that would apply after the Acceptance Time
or the Closing, (iv) obtain as promptly as practicable all other consents,
approvals, waivers, permits, clearances and other actions of or by any
Governmental Entity or third party that are necessary or required in order to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (v) supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to any
other Antitrust Laws. If the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or
the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")
issues a request for additional information and documentary material (a "
_Second Request_ ") under the HSR Act in relation to the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to limit the scope of such Second
Request but in any event shall comply with such Second Request as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to respond to and seek to resolve any requests for
information, documents, data or testimony made by the FTC or the DOJ under the
HSR Act.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law and subject to Section
7.04(c), each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall in connection with the reasonable best efforts
referenced in Section 7.04(a), (i) cooperate in all respects with each other
in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) keep the other and/or its counsel informed of any
communication received from, or given to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S.
or foreign Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) permit the other
and/or its counsel to review any communication given by it to, and consult
with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ
or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the
FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Entity or other person, give the other
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to the matters covered in this Section 7.04, it is agreed that Parent, after
consulting with the Company and considering the Companys views in good faith,
shall take the lead in communicating with any Governmental Entity and
developing strategy for responding to any investigation or other inquiry by
any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or other applicable Law, and,
subject to its obligations under Section 7.04(a), shall make all final
decisions with respect to any requests that may be made by, or any actions,
consents, undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be sought by or from,
any Governmental Entity, including determining the manner in which to contest
or otherwise respond, by litigation or otherwise, to objections to, or
proceedings or other Actions challenging, the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At Parents
request, the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions
Parent reasonably requests in order to obtain any actions, consents,
undertakings, approvals or waivers by or from any Governmental Entity for or
in connection with, and to assist Parent in litigating or otherwise contesting
any objections to or proceedings or other Actions challenging, the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If a Governmental Entity requests a meeting with the
Company, the Company shall not permit any of its Representatives to
participate in any such meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation, proceeding or other matters related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless the Company consults
with Parent in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives Parent the opportunity to attend and lead the discussions at
such meeting. The Company agrees that, at the sole discretion and direction of
Parent (and at Parents expense), it shall agree to any and all divestitures
or other remedies relating to itself or any of its Subsidiaries that are
necessary to ensure the termination or expiration of the waiting period under
the HSR Act or the obtaining of any other approvals or consents required from
any Governmental Entity under any applicable Antitrust Law to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , __ that nothing in this Section 7.04(c) shall
obligate the Company to agree to any such divestiture or any other remedy not
conditioned on the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other

SECTION 7.05 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual that, as of the
Effective Time, is a present or former director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from
and against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by such
individual in connection with any Action arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or pertaining to the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including with
respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been permitted under applicable Law, the
Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, advance expenses incurred by such individual in connection therewith to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law as long as such individual
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such individual is not entitled to indemnification; _provided_ ,
_however_ , __ that any determination required to be made with respect to
whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth
under applicable Law, the Company Charter and/or the Company Bylaws shall be
made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation and (ii)
without limitation to clause (i), to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving
Corporations (or any successors) certificate of incorporation and

 



      
 

 



 

bylaws for a period of six years after the Effective Time, the current
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, and
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors, officers and
employees of the Company, contained in the Company Charter and the Company
Bylaws of the Company, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
7.05(a) with respect to any Action shall notify Parent of such Action promptly
after becoming aware thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure actually prejudices the
indemnifying party.

 



 

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties, rights and other assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to), as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for
"tail" prepaid insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the Indemnified Parties, with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to
acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). If such "tail" prepaid
insurance policies have been obtained, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, after the Effective Time to maintain such policies in
full force and effect, for its full term, and to continue to honor its
respective obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to obtain such "tail"
prepaid insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time for the Indemnified Parties,
the DandO Insurance (provided that Parent (or any successor) may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage and amounts which are, in the aggregate, as favorable to
the Indemnified Parties as provided in the existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement); _provided, however_ , that in no event will Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required, and the Company shall not be permitted, to
expend for such policies pursuant to this Section 7.05 an annualized premium
amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
for such insurance and if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Company
may, obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.05 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise, including
any indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
From and after the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 7.05 shall not be terminated, amended or
modified in any manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party
(including their heirs and representatives) to whom this Section 7.05 applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party.

 



 

SECTION 7.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the

statement prior to such consultation, except as such Party may reasonably
conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with, or the rules of, any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Parent and the

agreed to by Parent and the Company.

opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder

SECTION 7.08 _Employee Matters_. (a) From the Effective Time until December
31, 2012, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, (i) to each then current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _Company Employee_ ," and collectively, the " _Company Employees_
"), (1) an annual rate of base salary or wages and (2) annual cash bonus
opportunities that are at least equal to the annual rate of base salary or
wages and annual cash bonus opportunities, respectively, payable to such
Company Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) to the Company Employees, as a whole, benefits (other
than equity compensation) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate,
to the benefits provided to the Company Employees immediately before the
Effective Time.

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and, for purposes of
determining severance and vacation benefits only, level of benefits under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to
Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee
benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under

 



      
 

 



 

any defined benefit pension plan, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized
early retirement or retiree medical or life benefits or to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans (including
Parents severance plan) to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no Company Employee who is entitled to severance
benefits upon termination pursuant to any written severance plan or past
practice of the Company or its Subsidiaries or under the retention, or any
other, agreements entered into with certain executives, officers and other
employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents severance plan, and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits and/or short- or long-term disability or life insurance
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent, and
shall use its reasonable efforts to cause, any eligible expenses incurred by
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(c) The Company has provided Parent with a copy of its initial communication
materials for dissemination and communication to the Companys directors,
officers and employees pertaining to business operations and employment
matters (including compensation or benefit matters) that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to making any written or
material, broad based oral communications to the directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would be a material
change to the substance of such initial communication materials, the Company
shall reasonably consult with Parent prior to making such change. Prior to
making any broad based email communication or any postings on the Companys
internal website, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the proposed
communication and allow Parent a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on such mutually agreeable communication.

treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any
third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.08 or (iii)

survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination
shall relieve any Party from any liability or damages resulting from the
willful and material breach by a Party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth herein. For purposes of this
Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach that is
a consequence of an act taken by the breaching party, or the failure by the
breaching party to take an act it is required to take under this Agreement,
with the actual knowledge that the taking of, or the failure to take, such act
would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
Section 9.01(f) or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(g), then the
Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $395,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_
") by wire transfer of same-day funds no later than (x) in the case of a
termination referred to in the foregoing clause (i), the second business day
following the date of such termination or (y) in the case of a termination
referred to in the foregoing clause (ii), prior to or concurrently with such
termination.

 



 

(c) In the event that a Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the
Company Board or the senior executives of the Company or shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Takeover Proposal (and such Takeover Proposal or publicly announced intention
shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification at least 10
business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) prior to the date on which this Agreement is terminated), and (i)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i) or (B) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(c)
and (ii) if at any time prior to the date that is 12 months after the date of
any such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any
definitive Contract providing for, or the Company Board or the Company
approves, or recommends to its stockholders, any Takeover Proposal or any
Takeover Proposal is consummated (in each case regardless of whether such
Takeover Proposal was made or consummated before or after termination of this
Agreement), then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of same-day
funds, the Termination Fee not later than two business days after the date of
the first to occur of the event(s) referred to in clause (ii) of this Section
9.02(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the foregoing a
Takeover Proposal shall not be deemed to have been "publicly withdrawn" by any
person if, within 12 months after any such termination, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive Contract providing for, or the
Company Board or the Company approves, recommends to its stockholders or does
not oppose, a Takeover Proposal made by or on behalf of such person or any of
its Affiliates or any such Takeover Proposal is consummated. Solely for
purposes of this Section 9.02(c), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall

 



      
 

 



 

have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 7.03(a) except that all
references to "15% or more" therein shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority."

 



 

(d) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
Section 9.02(b) and Section 9.02(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 9.02(b) or Section 9.02(c),
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit against the
Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. In the event of a termination of this Agreement under the
circumstances giving rise to payment by the Company of the Termination Fee,
any payment by the Company of such Termination Fee (together with payment of
any additional costs and expenses that may be required to be paid under this
Section 9.02(d)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its
Affiliates for damages against the Company with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby other than with respect to a willful and
material breach of this Agreement by the Company. In no event shall the
Company be required to pay any amounts due to Parent pursuant to this Section
9.02 on more than one occasion.

PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.13.

 



 

SECTION 10.14 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Subject to the foregoing, if any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of such provision to any person or any circumstance, is invalid or
unenforceable, (a)

 



      
 

 



 

a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any
other jurisdiction.

 



 

SECTION 10.15 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

SECTION 10.16 _Guarantee_. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and

 ** _EXHIBIT A_**

 



 

 **CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER**

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required
to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs
obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
(and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) unless (i) there shall
be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number
of Shares that represents at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis as of the Expiration Date (assuming the
issuance of all shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all
outstanding Company Stock Options, Company SARs, warrants and other rights to
purchase shares of Common Stock) (such condition, the " _Minimum Condition_ ")
and (ii) (a) the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired
or been terminated (such condition, the " _HSR Condition_ ") and (b) (x) CFIUS
shall have issued a letter to the Parties pursuant to 31 C.F.R. part 800,
subpart D, stating a determination that either (A) it has determined that the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement are not "covered transactions"
under Section 721 or (B) there are no unresolved national security concerns
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and action
under Section 721 is therefore concluded or (y) CFIUS shall have recommended
that the President prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the President shall have rejected such recommendation of CFIUS and shall
have announced, pursuant to clause (d) of Section 721, a decision not to
exercise authority under Section 721 with respect to such transactions (such
condition, together with the HSR Condition, the " _Regulatory Conditions_ ").
In addition, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) if at any
time on or after the date of the commencement of the Offer and prior to the
Expiration Date, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing at
the then scheduled Expiration Date:

 



 

(1) (i) there shall be pending any Action by any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction (A) seeking a Restraining Order or (B) seeking to
impose, or requiring that the Parties agree to, any conditions, restrictions
or other measures necessary to satisfy the Regulatory Conditions that would
result, individually or in the aggregate, in any Adverse Regulatory Effect or
(ii) there shall (x) be in effect any Restraining Order or (y) have been
imposed by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction any conditions,
restrictions or other measures necessary to satisfy the Regulatory Conditions
that, individually or in the aggregate, result in any Adverse Regulatory
Effect;

 



 

(2) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

      
 

 



 

(3) (i) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section
4.01(a), Section 4.03(a), Section 4.03(b) (other than the last two sentences
thereof), Section 4.04 or Section 4.21 of this Agreement shall not have been
true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement or as of and
as though made on the Expiration Date (except to the extent that any such
representation or warranty expressly addresses matters only as of a specified
date, which need only be true and correct as of such specified date), except
for any failures of any of the representations and warranties in such portions
of Section 4.03 of this Agreement to be so true and correct that, individually
or in the aggregate, are immaterial in nature and amount, (ii) the
representation and warranty of the Company contained in clause (a)(i) of
Section 4.07 of this Agreement shall not have been true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement or as of and as though made on the
Expiration Date, or (iii) any of the other representations or warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement shall not have been true and correct
as of the date of this Agreement or as of and as though made on the Expiration
Date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly
addresses matters only as of a specified date, which need only be true and
correct as of such specified date), in each case without giving effect to any
Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualifications contained therein,
except for any failures of any such representations and warranties to be so
true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(4) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it hereunder at or prior to the
Expiration Date;

 



 

(5) Parent shall not have received, as of the Expiration Date, certificates
signed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or chief
financial officer of the Company stating that (i) the condition set forth in
clause (3) of this Exhibit A shall have been satisfied and (ii) the Company
shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement immediately prior to the Expiration Date;
or

 



 

(6) any change, effect, occurrence or circumstance shall have occurred since
the date of this Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

The foregoing conditions shall be for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and may
be asserted by Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any
such conditions and may be waived by Merger Sub in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time, in each case except for the Minimum Condition and
the HSR Condition, in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of this
Agreement and applicable Law. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, the rights and obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Unless waived by Merger Sub in a written notice
to the Company, any Shares subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be
deemed not to be validly tendered for purposes of satisfying the Minimum
Condition unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed
delivery are delivered to or on behalf of Merger Sub. Any reference in this
_Exhibit A_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to a condition or requirement
being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition or
requirement is so waived. The failure by Merger Sub at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right may be deemed an ongoing right that

      
 

 



 

may be asserted at any time and from time to time. Each of the foregoing
conditions is independent of any of the other foregoing conditions; the
exclusion of any event from a particular condition does not mean that such
event may not be included in another condition. Capitalized terms used but not
defined in this _Exhibit A_ shall have the meaning ascribed to them elsewhere
in this Agreement to which this _Exhibit A_ is attached.
